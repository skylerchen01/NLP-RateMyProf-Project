5,Leslie  Looney,looney is a super funny guy and this class was really interesting it a complete blow off but it too bad just do all the sessions and study a bit the night before exams and you should pull an a i would definitely recommend him for a science gen ed there was no text book and no final
6,Leslie  Looney,professor looney is the bomb he is a truly good teacher and really explains material thoroughly he is also absolutely hilarious and makes me laugh every class i would highly recommend him and this course to anyone i am far from a sciencelover but this class has helped me enjoy i repeat enjoy science
7,Leslie  Looney,professor leslie looney is honestly amazing i would call this my first positive experience with a science class in addition to being truly good at teaching he makes class interesting i literally lol almost every period looney forever
8,Leslie  Looney,looney is a beast best prof on campus and this class is extremely interesting it is the easiest astronomy and physical science class you will find
9,Leslie  Looney,the homework exams and lab could trip you up if expecting a blowoff class but otherwise its great looney is very enthusiastic and the course is full of interesting content
10,Leslie  Looney,he is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors ever meet his grading is very fair the exams bad considering you can use a notes sheet lots of iclickers so you have to show up to class no book used take this class its fun and interesting
11,Leslie  Looney,sexy boy killer skies was one of the best classes taken looney kept me excited for class and did presentations effectively and with great humor highly recommend him in general online quizzes were tough but given multiple chances exams are somewhat hard so study never a dry moment great guy great topics gonna have fun ciao
12,Leslie  Looney,excellent professor hilarious fun and good
13,Leslie  Looney,loved his killer skies class very funny and allows you to bring in a sheet of notes for each test and even the final theres no textbook but you have to use his ppt slides alot for the hw and cheat sheets the hw is quite hard tho even with the ppt slides given to you but you get unlimited number of tries and the highest score is taken
14,Leslie  Looney,a kind knowledgeable phenomenal teacher i would recommend any of his classes he is hilarious engaging and intelligent this class was so far from my major and yet i enjoyed class everyday study its astronomy but looney is fantastic
15,Leslie  Looney,i hnonestly can say that leslie looney is the only reason i go to class that and the iclicker credit i say that actually learned anything in this class though looney is fairly entertaining
16,Leslie  Looney,he is absolutely amazing a complete riot and wonderful professor class is never boring and something new is taught daily online homework is a breeze and tests horrible studying is necessary for them though
17,Leslie  Looney,he is amazing the funnest class i have had all semester knows his material and is always willing to help
18,Leslie  Looney,best professor had so far he is informative clear and funny makes you actually wanna go to class gotta do homework regularly and study for the testthey bad if you do
19,Leslie  Looney,great professor and great class i recommend taking this course it was a physical science and quantitive reasoning ii course
20,Jans  Wager,dr wager is a great professor her expectations were clear and she really wants to help you succeed she was always entertaining and knew what she was talking about i took her hybrid course which i would definitely recommend
21,Jans  Wager,i love prof wager hilarious and dedicated i took this as the hybrid block and i loved it it is fast paced but not a ton of work the final is only a page paper and you can revise your essays as many times as you want she really wants you to do well and helps you as much as you can if i could take every class with her i would
22,Jans  Wager,taken as hybrid course it was good taking it with this teacher especially in a hybrid course she only assigns stuff that is needed be aware if you take this in a hybrid class there will be something due every time before the next class course work is easy if you are committed to it and turn it in on time peer reviews are not accepted late
23,Jans  Wager,good teacher i took this as a second block class on accident lots of reading in the class not super necessary for the lectures but a fun teacher excited to share english with students normal amount of homework assignments and a small page paper due at finals
24,Jans  Wager,overall she is a fine professor but there are a lot of little things like not very clear are sometimes weird do one peer review on time expect to get an a
25,Jans  Wager,wager is a great professor she makes the class lively and is absolutely hilarious i took the hybridblock course as long as you do the assignments on time an easy a the only complaints i have are a lot of the content is politically influenced liberal and she always describe assignments or what is expected of you well
26,Jans  Wager,jans does an excellent job of teaching the basics and technical aspects of cinema while putting a spin on things great professor who cares that her class learn new perspectives from her lectures she is a solid grader and gave great feedback whenever i asked for it my writing skills have improved from taking this course
27,Jans  Wager,really enjoyed her class took it as a hybrid block class so it was very fast paced and all the assignments were submitted online she was very clear about how she wanted you to write and was very willing to help i would take her again i was very impressed with her teaching style
28,Jans  Wager,jans is great she is a fantastic teacher and her class was both interesting and lively she does expect you to read a lot out of the book and other sources as well she is a very lively teacher and you can tell she loves the subject she teaches
29,Jans  Wager,one of my favorite teachers taken i actually took her last semester but i liked her enough that i thought everyone should still know awesome she is clear on the work and you go over it in class i taken her for as well if she offered it
30,Jans  Wager,i found professor wager very helpful she does have a specific way she wants you to write but does make it clear after the first few assignments she helped me with brevity but wanted me to change my writing style to match the way she liked it she was a decent professor and is very willing to help
31,Jans  Wager,i took into to cinema studies from her and loved it great teacher which allot of film experience she will work with you to sharpen your writing skills one of my favorite professors here on campus just be prepared to think outside the box about movies
32,Jans  Wager,trouble is if you have different opinions on the topics you talk about then she like you as long as you stick to what she lays out you should be good she wants very badly to have students she molds if she mold you throw you away
33,Jans  Wager,jans is wonderful her teaching methods are some of the best that i have experienced there is a good deal of time involved in the course but if you like film criticism you mind though the subject ended up not being my cup of tea i still enjoyed going to class and doing the assignments
34,Jans  Wager,jans is an excellent teacher just awesome she is definitely organized she wants class discussion and that makes the class fun you can correct your papers at the end of the semester in your portfolio to have a better grade she is friendly and sincerly cares about student success word of caution mandatory attendance and ever be late
35,Jans  Wager,i loved this class jans is very flexible and openminded she just wants to help students learn take her class
36,Jans  Wager,jan is an amazing professor and i highly recommend taking her for english grades are easy to improve as you can edit your writing assignments as much as you want to get a better grade
37,Jans  Wager,she was an excellent teacher very organized she encouraged class discussion which made the class fun had several papers to do which helped you to improve writing skills could correct papers to have a better grade she is also friendly and genuinely interested in student success awesome all around
38,Jans  Wager,writing in her class was fun i really liked how she would let students rewrite their papers till they got the grade they wanted it certainly kept my grade up
39,Jans  Wager,jans has the most effective teaching style of any teacher met the material can be difficult but she makes it very easy to do well you have a series of papers to write if you get a bad score on them she will let you rewrite them for a better score you can continue rewriting them until you get the score you want.well prepared helpfull
40,Robert  Warden,this guy is a quack you never understand what he is saying
41,Robert  Warden,mind is sort of like a lottery ball machine every now and then a ball will come firing out with a small piece of information but never in a sequential order nice guy though
42,Robert  Warden,he likes to talk about his cat and diareha
43,Robert  Warden,could i despise this man anymore his lectures are one random topic after another he is always late and never knows when the class is over partially because he wear a watch lost every single one of my papers truly awful waste of time
44,Robert  Warden,the lectures are sleepinducing unless u participate he gives lots of credit if u do study sheets for quizzes so u know what expect tests are doable if u read the material page paper at the end so sick of doing philau papers
45,Robert  Warden,thinks too much knows too much but all in all hes a great person to work with though sometimes it looks like its painful for him to teach all the sweat is a shame
46,Robert  Warden,wonderful teacher he is kind and knows his stuff take him if you can
47,Robert  Warden,talks soo much zz where am i but very down to earth fair grader if u do the work participate in class it really really helps ur grade so do it
48,Bryan  Eldredge,i took his online class as an elective and regretted taking it by the end the information is interesting but he is a tough grader his tests were hard and very confusing
49,Bryan  Eldredge,he gives quizzes that are hard to understand the midterm and the final are a joke the questions are twisted in such a way to just confuse you which i think is his main goal you will love the class and hate it at the end most of my classmates agreed with me on this good luck you will need it
50,Bryan  Eldredge,best professor had at uvu if you show up pay attention participate and read learn a lot and get a good grade
51,Bryan  Eldredge,by far one of the best professors ever had he give busy work and he consistently checks to make sure that understanding the materials great professor highly recommend
52,Bryan  Eldredge,bryan is awesome he knows his stuff he knows how to teach for understanding and how to make all subjects interesting he expects quite a lot but is always there to help i came out learning a ton and loving the subject
53,Bryan  Eldredge,really good professor knows what talking about willing to work with you tests kinda hard and expects a lot but makes it fun if you pay attention you will do well in the class has you make a language for this class as final project
54,Bryan  Eldredge,great teacher and fun class two thumbs up and totally recommend this professor to others
55,Bryan  Eldredge,take this class bryan is the man do the reading and the assignments and study for midterm and final and be fine half is linguistics which might be difficult for some but he explains it well work on your language creation project throughout the semester great class i loved class discussions and he includes everyone take it
56,Bryan  Eldredge,before you take any of his classe you should have a masters in english he cares more about your grammar than your content he make very clear points and he tests on things that he teach and arent in the books nice man but perhaps not the best teacher
57,Bryan  Eldredge,language class was great be patient through the linguistics and the culture part is awesome be warned you will only get an a if you earn it completely read everything asked of you and do the workbook assignments hilarious and extremely fair very fun class highly recommended
58,Bryan  Eldredge,bryan is one of the best asl and deaf history teachers i have ever had pay attention and you go wrong
59,Bryan  Eldredge,he was my teacher for years he knows alot about deaf culture history and linguistics i loved having him and it was a lot of fun it was very educational for me if it werent for him then i be able to know a lot of things because i am currente
60,Bryan  Eldredge,he is very good he likes to take the time to teach his students he about how they do if you understand something he is willing to actually help you keeps class entertaining
61,Bryan  Eldredge,i am very disappointed in this class i have decided against taking any asl classes because of this instructor i have also changed my major because of this class
62,Bryan  Eldredge,very knowledgeable about the topic asl clear and easy to read expects a lot from his students and makes you earn that a but you come away from his classes with improved skill in asl and more knowledge about topics relating to the deaf highly recomended
63,Bryan  Eldredge,no comments
64,Bryan  Eldredge,very interesting willing to help and respects oppinions very knowledgable about the subject
65,Bryan  Eldredge,very good history teacher well informed clear signs and fair instructor
66,William  Hollinrake,took online course day after midterms i was the one who turned in the next assignment rest of the year was people turning in their homework took off points for incorrect comments not just incorrect code hyperspecific bad teacher wouldnt even help me install the software properly gave no link to online instructions either
67,William  Hollinrake,this professor should not teach he does not actually care about whether or not his students fail he does not give instruction but rather is a grader and when he does give feedback not productive he just tells you what you did wrong there is no helpful criticism he is just out for an ego boost
68,William  Hollinrake,he does not do a very good job of actually instructing if you meet with him during his how to schedule facetoface meeting hours then screwed as far as learning more good luck actually learning how to do anything from him
69,William  Hollinrake,he will give you a zero for even the smallest of errors does not answer questions or help just tells you to read the book his grading system is completely outrageous and the class is more about following his ever growing set of rules than learning to code not at all what i expected from an introductory coding class
70,William  Hollinrake,although this professor sticks to his syllabus when grading his system is outrageous i was deducted points from the first assignment out of points possible idk how that makes sense of which was for a single incorrect output when my other six were correct gives no credit for correct lines of code only deducts for wrong ones
71,William  Hollinrake,he answer questions and meet with students unless you submit your questions to him first over of the class has dropped out he has insulted students and grade fairly i told him i was having trouble on quizzes he told me to read the book he is an embarrassment for dmacc take his class
72,William  Hollinrake,his use different fonts and is just a list of all of the things you allowed to do this class about learning to code about remembering his rules bother asking him for help he answer questions if you follow his rules on how to ask questions he will respond but he will not help you
73,William  Hollinrake,missed the first assignment because i was moving did every assignment thereafter and he had me dropped at midterms for not attending does not give clear instructions and he seem to care at all about the students i get the impression he is one of those people that is miserable and wants everyone else to be miserable as well
74,William  Hollinrake,this professor has no concept of how to teach a class i should have read the warning signs he waits until the refund date for classes to actually assign homework his list of specifications took a full minute just to scroll through he double deducts points because he lists them in different ways do not take he enjoys taking points off
75,William  Hollinrake,horrible gives no help to students and expects unrealistic levels of perfection on homework
76,William  Hollinrake,i should have listened to the reviews on here avoid this instructor at all cost i started the class did my first assignment got out of correct and received a grade unrealistic expectations from this instructor dropped this class after the first quiz to get a refund
77,William  Hollinrake,this teacher will not inspire you to be a better programmer he takes pride in deducting as many points as possible do you want to get on an assignment because you forgot to comment the number and use correct naming conventions even though your program runs this professor is for you
78,William  Hollinrake,listened to everyone on here not sure how this guy still has a job unreal requirements that would not apply in the real world all based on what he wants to see not what is logical even if work is correct it has to be done in his ridiculously specific manner in order and you will still lose points avoid at all costs
79,William  Hollinrake,both books outdated one by years he did not explain his way on how to turn in assignments properly explanation for everything is repetition of syllabus and reread open days is required to meet he insulted students and scares students from giving instruction on discussion board the download is provided to him
80,William  Hollinrake,horrible instructor wish i had looked him up before taking his class change to another instructor immediately deducts points like going out of style fully functioning solutions with documentation deducted points for unclear technicalities
81,William  Hollinrake,hands down worst teacher ever drop now he is not helpful and takes joy in handing out consider yourself warned
82,William  Hollinrake,drop this class immediately absolutely will not teach anything that is not needed for the assignments flat out said he answer my question about something in the textbook because we need it for any assignments you are better off buying the book and using stackoverflow for your questions
83,William  Hollinrake,easily the worst teacher ever had his idea of teaching was just read the book he would look for any excuse to give on assignments i got one on the assignment of the semester not because it was late but because i sent it as attachment in email instead using blackboard it seemed to me like he was only there to collect a paycheck
84,William  Hollinrake,warning by far the worst online teacher no communication skills no desire to help
85,William  Hollinrake,showed his assignments and emails to it personnel i work with and was adivsed that his class be of use in the real world
86,Lauren  Baumbach,knows alot the class is long and boring but she gives good notes
87,Lauren  Baumbach,originally enjoy this woman however she is unfortunately stuck with teaching the worst subject of all time i like her alot as a person she is very dry and not interested in what teaching but who could blame her give her a shot ok
88,Lauren  Baumbach,knows but is really hard unfair grader and tests are horrible
89,Lauren  Baumbach,one word dry
90,Lauren  Baumbach,great teacher learned a lot from her class she is very helpful and is willing to meet with you after class if you are having trouble though shes a very hard grader she is reasonable take her class only if you are willing to learn and work
91,Lauren  Baumbach,very tough not funny but i learned alot overall not bad
92,Lauren  Baumbach,very helpful and she knows her stuff she is willing to help you with any questions you may have
93,Lauren  Baumbach,boring as dirt
94,Lauren  Baumbach,horrible professor graded unfairly will give you the same grade for projects based off your first project grade bias toward girls terrible experience with her for building tech
95,Lauren  Baumbach,talks like the shabby sheak lady on hgtv ohmygod informative helpful funny in dry way but there were handouts she and charlie read from a freaking novel that they expected us to write down me but got carpel tunnel me off
96,Lauren  Baumbach,great professor to take very professional
97,Lauren  Baumbach,this was probably one of my favorite studios lauren was very helpful and professional as well as working out details
98,Lauren  Baumbach,get sick during semester get no sympathy needs nu wardrobe safari attiregood thing she designs arch not clothing bases grades on pers opinion not ur work best wishes if u get stuck her
99,Beverly  Faunce,i loved the course i took with beverly i definitely got some practical information i could actually use
100,Beverly  Faunce,beverly was extremely helpful and had a lot of practical advice i will actually use what i learned in her class which certainly the case with all rtc courses
101,Beverly  Faunce,nice lady but clueless announcing that she was single and available help begged for us to give her fives i thought that was inappropriate
102,Beverly  Faunce,i have taken rtc courses and she was the worse instructor she was late to class and did not pay attention during class presentations we went to the a pool one day what a waste of time and money
103,Beverly  Faunce,professor faunce is a very fair teacher if you do your work get an a some of her activities may seem very elementary ed but the program not her
104,Beverly  Faunce,having just completed my rtc course she is by far the worst instructor had i would never take another course with her
105,Beverly  Faunce,kind of funny some of the activities make you feel like in elementary school
106,Deborah  Pluss,pluss is hysterical and made comm research methods bearable there are no surprises here and the final is just the four quizzes she gave throughout the semester of those four she drops the lowest one there were assignments quizzes including the final the material can be dry but not on her she made a boring class fun take her
107,Deborah  Pluss,prof pluss is sweet and upbeat her quizzes are about questions however she does drop the lowest of the there is a group project and a final project easy a if you study for the quizzes
108,Deborah  Pluss,i took her for research methods and had to drop her class half way nice lady but veryy tough grader and gives you an f even if you do the work i had fs even though i did my work and gave everything on time usually gives assignments and the final research project the lectures are pretty long overall i do not reccomend
109,Deborah  Pluss,professor pluss grades assignments very harshly even when you put effort into them not clear when explaining material and class is very boring
110,Deborah  Pluss,i believe she has changed her teaching style since these last comments very into the class but its just too much for a course had to curve the midterm and final because the averages were she would be great for a higher level course but you can definitely take an easier professor for this class
111,Deborah  Pluss,great professor i love this class she sso helpful and teaches in an interesting way the test and quiz was challenging but it was all good study cause you will need to know your stuff very fun class
112,Deborah  Pluss,she is a best professor we had project and exam i passed her class with a a or b i am not sure however she is helpful if you need a good grade and want to take the course i say take her class she is helpful and a great professor trust me
113,Deborah  Pluss,a great professor who give a fantastic introduction to the university if you have a chance to take her go for it
114,Deborah  Pluss,super nice lady and the class is super easy
115,Deborah  Pluss,the easiest a i ever got easiest grader wpu told going to be on the exams and speeches are graded more on effort and organization worry you have to give a powel or obamalike delivery

119,Deborah  Pluss,she is a very fair prof.the material is easy and she makes it interesting.no midterm just weekly hw assignments a speech a few papers.i had a lot of fun in the class and i think a great instructor very sweet
120,Deborah  Pluss,very nice woman but really isnt the teaching type in a semester we learned maybe things total which she kept repeating over and over and over again pretty easy though final midterm speech and a paper
121,Deborah  Pluss,shes nice and occasionally has fun inclass assignments but most of the time its just boring common sense material tests are essays and study guides are very broad not much to evaluate your grade
122,Deborah  Pluss,no comments
123,Deborah  Pluss,she grades on the final midterm short paper min speech and attendance the paper speech are easy but the tests are tough she gives study guides but they cover a lot of material answers emails very quickly
124,Deborah  Pluss,she is very easy but you have to show up to classes because she covers the material on the test in class
125,Deborah  Pluss,pros pluss is very nice she tries to make class fun her grading is fair and if you take her notes you are sure to pass her tests she only assigns about report on a movie and oral report shes pretty easygoing and class was not hard at all
126,Lauren  Bold,great person and teacher easy style and fun to have class with
127,Lauren  Bold,very nice and smart she asked us to do a few extra papers beyond rtc requirements
128,Mary  Richardson,cool sometime laughs upsettingly loud but not from an evil intention she enjoys teaching class is about critical writing and provides fun discussion time it goes in appropriate pace so easy to keep up hw amount is moderate
129,Mary  Richardson,she is a very nice teacher she is really clear on what she wants us to accomplish tries and helps students understand as much as possible grades fair but a little hard do the homework a few essays from the readings but she will walk you through it
130,Mary  Richardson,no comments
131,Mary  Richardson,in addition to those two smiling faces below she is fair do your hw and be fine she is encouraging motivating consistent practical and understanding she prepares you well for final so you can not tricks there should be more teachers like her in sdsu it is a journey that you regret while in school and after
132,Mary  Richardson,she is one of the best professors ever had she really cares about her students and their learning experience she actually teaches i learned so much from her the only people who have any problems are the lazy ones that never go to class plus really cute
133,Mary  Richardson,mary is a very cute clothes she gives examples of a papers makes you write preparagraphs and discusses what is good and bad in them before the essays are clear only i got an and adored her class was only boring if you add to the conversation
134,Mary  Richardson,i did not know there is a teacher in this world that is lazy as she is she dismisses the class very early so if some student did not undrestand thay have to learn themselves at home but if you are lazy as she is and do not want to learn anything you may take her class do not worry she either gives you a grade to pass or not
135,Mary  Richardson,she isnt as hot as everyone is saying and her class is usually boring she drops your grade for bad attendence essays and assignments are easy enough though
136,Mary  Richardson,shes too damn liberal i think shes a communist she tries to politicize english thats not the way it should be
137,Mary  Richardson,one wordboring soo boring her lectures are unorganized
138,Mary  Richardson,great teacher very helpful and understanding
139,Mary  Richardson,she is not all that lectures are boring takes atendance and lower you score for missing class not helpful
140,Mary  Richardson,i never thought i would like a writing class she is very nice and helpfull good looking also
141,Mary  Richardson,an awesome professor i never thought i will enjoy writing til i had her as my professor
142,Mary  Richardson,she is a very teacher if you are motivated for learning definitly you can make it but please show up and hand in assignment on important
143,Mary  Richardson,grammar and language made easy should be the tittle of her class excellent professor
144,Mary  Richardson,great teacher hot very helpful
145,Tracey  Francese,really teach the class she just breaks us down into small groups and we have to read and do group discussions every class not much homework gives you study guides for the exam but doesnt really review overall dont take her if you dont like group discussions and if you teach yourself
146,Tracey  Francese,lots of reading does give a review sheet but exams are not easy if you read the chapters you have to spread to groups every class and discuss the readings if you hate reading or group discussions take her class
147,Tracey  Francese,i had prof francese a few semesters back i called on her for a letter of ref and she was all about it she was as helpful later as she was in class do the reading do the work and be fine she is very open minded and likeable
148,Tracey  Francese,i think that the women studies class would have been more interesting if i took another teacher francese seems like a nice person and her heart is in the right place but i just think she is teacher material he class is boring i dreaded going sorry ms francese but its the truth
149,Tracey  Francese,tests extremely difficult unless you actually memorize each of the definitions she hands out for you to look up the tests also have little to do with class discussions homework read pages a week her attitude standoffish does not understand this is a gen ed a studio art major which means more time consuming work than most oth
150,Tracey  Francese,ugh ridiculous francese is a nece person and seems to have a good heart but does have an attitude problem her class is very boring it could be an interesting class but she makes it boring
151,Tracey  Francese,the reading is absolutely ridiculuos the chapters are or more pages long that needs to be read for the next week discussion the book is so boring things that you absolutly would not have interest she says that she judge us based on our opinions but she does during discussion take her
152,Tracey  Francese,this was the easiest of all the classes i took this you take her at night she lets you out get no break either much gives you the answers to the test and there is a opinion paper class is all discussion with video and she trys to get guest is a short oral presentation on a reading of your choice
153,Tracey  Francese,really like her or the class the whole semester think doing good and then when your final grade is a d be surprised if you would like to read and memorize and entire book her exams are all fill in the blank then take this class
154,Tracey  Francese,her tests were imposible the reading is rediculous you have to memorize stuff that ultimatly means nothing
155,Tracey  Francese,a lot of reading a lot of memorization for the tests which are tough even if you read classtime is pretty much all discussion do all the readings and study for the tests and do okay not a class i looked forward to though
156,Tracey  Francese,very knowledged professor who knows what talking about and does not try to push her own opinions on topics raised in class onto her students the class is very interesting and she will open your eyes to a new world
157,Tracey  Francese,she is awesome i wish i needed to take more classes because i would definitly find something she was teaching she is very easy and laid back she really knows what she is talking about because she works in the field with abused women
158,Tracey  Francese,very good teacher wouldnt mind taking her for another class very fair with the work given
159,Tracey  Francese,class was intereseting the whole class was involved she was very nice cancelled class a few times i would take her again for another class
160,Tracey  Francese,she was very nice the assignments were clear very easy going i enjoyed going to her class she kept the class involved
161,Tracey  Francese,she gives a lot of reading all we did in class was read a reading from the book as a group and then discuss it preety easy her tests are easy if you read the book she was absent about times which was good for dont regret taking her
162,Candice  White,dr white is one of the best professors i have ever had she truly loves students and what she teaches she is like a mother in the classroom she is also really funny she gives pop quizzes a lot and there is assigned reading

167,Candice  White,you absolutely have to read every night because she has pop quizzes so randomly sometimes once or twice a week and they are very technical questions that multiple choice and she drop it at the end when she drops your lowest quiz grade we also has a paper that she changed to being worth percent of our grade after turning it in
168,Candice  White,by far the most condescending mean disrespectful and downright rude professor ever of all the classes i have taken in my college career this was the absolute worst very unclear instructions not to mention ridiculous amounts of outdated readings required do yourself a favor and do not take any classes by her you will regret it
169,Candice  White,loved her she is a bit crazy but in a good way she genuinely wants her students to have a good grasp on the material if she is teaching any other upper level pr classes while at ut i will definitely sign up for them attendance mandatory but encouraged she gives inclasses quizzes pretty often worth a lot of your grade
170,Candice  White,she really contradicts herself you have to read the book before she teaches you or else you will get confused she rambles about her study abroad trip a good of most classes
171,Candice  White,dr white is by far the best teacher had at ut if you come to class and pay attention she will be incredibly helpful especially in office hours she gives pop quizzes but also gives at least opportunities to replace a bad quiz grade if you come to class overall helpful to the point and knows her stuff take this class for sure
172,Candice  White,good instructor skip classshe gives frequent pop quizes read the text ask questions and take good notes tests are multiple choice
173,Candice  White,she is a very good teacher she loves the subject she has a quiz every week but like one question and writing your already of the quiz boosts up my grade for sure the exams are pretty easy but i still fail them lol still gives you credit for speaking up in class and she likes it if you sit in the first rows
174,Candice  White,dr white is a fantastic instructor she is very passionate about pr and gets the class involved so that you falling asleep she offers daily quizzes to check attendance and to help boost your grade she is absolutely wonderful and someone i admire greatly
175,Candice  White,dr white is scary and can be rude she knows what she is talking about but intimidated me to death wants people to join in the discussion and will call you out in front of the class if you made a mistake i did learn a lot but would have rather had a different professor if you have to take her you will be fine i got a for the course
176,Candice  White,dr white is an incredible professor two years into my pr career i still quote things she said in my class tough but fair despite appearance pr is very difficult field her class is a good test on whether succeed sit in the front join prssa and do all the readings if you enjoy this class major in pr
177,Candice  White,she is horrible talks to students like the are in fifth grade take dr shaw
178,Candice  White,be vocal and participate if she can tell daydreaming screwed very intelligent woman and knows her stuff she remembers just about all of her students which i think is a good sign i really liked her one of my fave profs she was my advisor too and helped me a lot
179,Candice  White,i liked her and she still remembers me i would suggest sitting in the front row or at least be vocal during discussions the best way to get a long with her
180,Candice  White,she does favor those who are vocal in class and demonstrate comprehension of the material so sit near the front and speak out i got a in the class and cracked the book maybe twice just look out for the squeeks
181,Candice  White,the worst teacher i ever had so negative about everything not understanding and just plain unfair to people she favor highly reccomend taking this course from dr.shaw
182,Pat  Ledbetter,the most time consuming class ever taken she is a tough grader but very detailed in her feedback online class had total papers and endless online discussions i asked her a question about one of the papers and she was very rude about it admit i read the entire assignment but still she been nicer about it
183,Pat  Ledbetter,this class will kick your butt with that being said you will become a better student because of it instructor is very very knowledgeable and has fantastic real life stories to share this class requires a lot out of you tests are far from easy and the countless papers and online classroom discussions will require a lot of time and committmen
184,Pat  Ledbetter,i liked her her instructions were detailed and it was easy to do an assignment then look at the list and check them off she wrote up her own material which was easily printed off from canvas and her video lectures could be listened to on mobile app topics changed every wks but i promise you will learn so much do all extra credit
185,Pat  Ledbetter,if you have a lot of classes work i do not recommend this class she is a great teacher opinionated but thoughtful papers due every two weeks one semester paper and participation in online threads mandatory min of two posts then at least two more as more people joined study for the
186,Pat  Ledbetter,this class is definitely a challenge but one that i enjoyed she does assign alot of work but gives plenty of time to turn them in some say that opinionated but like to think of her as a free thinker aware of the problem with society she wants students to think and i can appreciate that study study i pulled off an
187,Pat  Ledbetter,good teacher
188,Pat  Ledbetter,writing notes important to pass she takes notebooks for a grade will not let you use laptop in class txtbk only available online mcgrawhill complete learnsmart sections on mcgrawhill almost every week for hmwk online quiz every week min for questions nice helpful some classmates are offended when she has to cover
189,Pat  Ledbetter,extremely opinionated and grades papers based off the opinions stated i.e if you disagree with what she says in lecture your grade will be poor worst professor ever had
190,Pat  Ledbetter,take notes for a grade read assigned chapters hw test are over lecture readings extra credit does not let you fail amazing at help a semester research paper pgs but if you ask her for help visit her office working hard an easy bc she helps you out so much you will learn if dedicated
191,Pat  Ledbetter,professor ledbetter may seem a little all over the place okay she really is all over the place read the textbook a test every couple of weeks a lecture and reading there for help all you have to do is ask she has plenty of material to help you with your topics for her research paper i really enjoyed her class
192,Pat  Ledbetter,papers for a short summer term please do yourself a favor and take her class tough grader endless homework
193,Pat  Ledbetter,amazing i learned so much from prof ledbetter and the course is very eye opening loved and would definitely take again
194,Pat  Ledbetter,pat ledbetter is extremely knowledgeable and certainly knows this subject inside and out she is very involved with the online students as she would email me right back if ever i had any issues or questions she interacts with the class in the discussion forums as well i must tell you however that you do need to do the work she likes to assign writing papers and her tests can be challenging but if you aim to learn and do the work you will learn she is very good at what she does but she is pretty tough
195,Pat  Ledbetter,do yourself a favor and do not take this class the papers that you will be directed to write will come with vague instructions when you follow the instructions guess what the rules change and you are penalized unfair grading vague descriptions topic jumping also vague you do not know how she arrives at your grade because its made up
196,Pat  Ledbetter,lots of homework unit papers plus term paper unit quizzes reading and rating other work and mandatory active participation on discussion boards not easy to work into a busy schedule as you had to more or less log in and participate daily no text book but minute video lectures each unit
197,Pat  Ledbetter,class is intense omg i had to work my butt off for an a lots of papers to write her directions very clear bunch of discussion board posts to make to if you think this is a blow off class think again you have to put in alot of work for this teacher i managed to barely streak by with an a i been happy with a c in this class
198,Pat  Ledbetter,her course is fairly intense so if you willing to do a research paper or read your textbook going to have a bad time the lecture tests were easy if you pay attention i did and the reading tests were easy if you read i if you write a good paper take good notes and read the book you should be fine
199,Pat  Ledbetter,this class is not easy you have to work your butt off to get an a there are so many papers to write and she grades them pretty tough her directions very clear either you also have alot of discussion board posts to make you have to put in alot of work for this teacher as long as you do all the work on time you will pass
200,Pat  Ledbetter,took this class online and there is much work involved each week many discussion boards requiring active participation there were research papers with confusing instructions although you could write about almost anything this class is not an easy a but possible if you put the work in
201,Pat  Ledbetter,do not take if looking for an easy a she makes you work for it and i still even made a b doing all i could she is passionate about human rights and i liked reading her writings about it but the only thing i liked she is really bad about being clear about directions and waits till the last second to point out an issue with your work
202,Juanita  Campos,professor campos is the sweetest most easy professor had i was nervous to take spanish since i since hs she makes the content easy and really works with you if you miss anything but make sure to tell her ahead of time quizzes and exams are pretty easy as well i would love to take her for spanish ii if she ever teaches it again
203,Juanita  Campos,prof campos is really nice she will work with you if you miss class office hours and communicating with her helps you need to pay attention and not skip class exams and papers are not to be taken lightly i learned a lot from her whoever complains about her class is just lazy
204,Juanita  Campos,not fully comprehend half of the time what she is saying if you have not taken spanish before or during high school do not take her she did not explain the materials really well her tests are easy if you know spanish tests drops
205,Juanita  Campos,meh she was alright take her again for an easy a but if you worry about your grades throughout out the semester and want to physically see them on blackboard not the teacher for you because she always takes forever to post grades
206,Juanita  Campos,she assigns a lot of work but fails to tell you when it is due very unorganized you can pretty much teach yourself the class as all she does is read the packets she gives you quizzes every week and usually behind schedule communicate good with students take someone else if you can
207,Juanita  Campos,do not take this teacher if you want to learn spanish she is extremely hard to understand and is horrible at teaching concepts i barely made a b because i took spanish in high school i was just rusty also she is extremely boring and monotoned i do not recommend her
208,Juanita  Campos,professora campos is nice and means well but she is pretty hard to follow she expects you to learn at a very fast pace but engage her students or encourage questions i had to rely heavily on the book and the web sam is ridiculous not a complete nightmare but take someone else if never spoken a lick of spanish before
209,Juanita  Campos,she is a great professor very kind hearted lenient and understanding her class was all in spanish the thing i appreciate more than anything is she grades by the level at in spanish not by letter grades per say if you are not as advanced as others she grades you at where you are she is soo helpful do the packets and the board work
210,Juanita  Campos,she is a really great professor kind of hard to understand but it is very easy to get an a she takes up a lot of completion grades and some of the auditory quizzes she gives you the script before hand it is very hard to not do well
211,Juanita  Campos,this class was extremely easy is a great professor attendance is mandatory and she has worksheets that she takes up every week on the worksheets let you do corrections so hard to get anything but a she drops your lowest grades from every section so this is an easy a
212,Juanita  Campos,professor campos is a good professor make sure to complete the assignments and keep them after she returns them because you will need them in the future for your writing journal grade tests are pretty easy if you come to class sometimes takes attendance for extra credit at the end of the year i enjoyed this class and did learn something
213,Juanita  Campos,ms campos is a nice person scattered sometimes she does take roll and has an online lab that has about assignmets per every two weeks but most lang classes will understanding and very lenient she speak amazing english but she is understandable if naturally good spn i recommend if not need to work a little
214,Juanita  Campos,there is no textbook she passes out sheets or just reads a sheet out to you everyday not too much reading aloud she seems unorganized and teaches to students who already know spanish well if you she tells you to go study on your time i learned more spanish in high school
215,Juanita  Campos,ms campos is nice and does the best she can with teaching however she is highly scatterbrained and changed the course work dates without notifying the class her tests are mediumhard and web sam takes forever
216,Juanita  Campos,personally i think she makes the class too easy if you know spanish or care to learn waste her time already pointed that out to some students
217,Juanita  Campos,a very nice lady but difficult to understand and unclear about expectations our was useless and there is no class participation required something mandatory if you actually want to learn people misbehave like children you can definitely phonein this class but just try to be clear about the due dates because she
218,Juanita  Campos,shes a great teacher shes very helpful and maker sure you understand the material i would take another class with her again
219,Juanita  Campos,a genuinely nice person she helps you bump up your grade as much as she can go to class she takes attendance do the websam homework assignments just to get them out of the way early otherwise be spending hours online on it i recommend her
220,Juanita  Campos,i really enjoyed this class she is so helpful and understanding if you attend class get an a so difficult to do poorly the cultural things she teaches are so great and fun to learn take her again
221,Juanita  Campos,i took spanish like years ago glad i chose to take prof campos she is so sweet and helpful and tries to make everything as simple as possible she consistently says this is too hard about examples in the book and simplifies them so the class can understand i will probably get a b in this class and years ago i made a d in spn
222,Ann  Lewald,this is a remedial course for students who score well on the act easy class if you miss five times you automatically fail the course all assignments are online and up to you to complete them if you miss any classes but fail the master exam you still pass the class you get a credit but it goes on your transcript

239,Ann  Lewald,she is pretty hip for her age and is quite informative and is easy to get along with and it is an easy class to pass
240,Ann  Lewald,she a little droopy but she is fun if you give her a chance very intelligent
241,Ann  Lewald,she is old and talks very monotone not easy on the eyes at all no peronality and she sucks she tells u at the start that u are not going to pass good luck
242,Hon  Linda,dr hon is an amazing human being she is someone you would want in your life even as a friend pr research with her was great super helpful willing to work with you and she was extremely understanding i wish she taught another course to take her again
243,Hon  Linda,excellent course though would have preferred if it been combined with adv6006 her enthusiasm is contagious sometimes too much powerpoint but she is an awesome professor overall i learned a lot and earned an a she is very clear about her expectations follow her guidelines and be just fine
244,Hon  Linda,very enthusiastic and helpful her high energy level is sometimes exhausting
245,Hon  Linda,no comments
246,Ruben  Mouhiddan,i liked ruben and what i learned from him you just have to learn how to listen to him
247,Ruben  Mouhiddan,it would be my luck to have him tons of times the worst teacher ever it would be nice if he knew anything except architecture could you be more irrelevant
248,Ruben  Mouhiddan,i believe that he may be a great architect but as a teacher it needs a lot of work because i had trouble in that class
249,Ruben  Mouhiddan,no comments
250,Ruben  Mouhiddan,ruben still hasnt fixed that dent in his lexus
251,Ruben  Mouhiddan,this teacher know alot but really know how to teach it he is a fun teacher but think about it before taking his class
252,Ruben  Mouhiddan,ruben likes to talk a lot but thats ok as long as interested in the history of design and architecture overall say cool
253,Ruben  Mouhiddan,no comments
254,Margaret  Mitchell,mrs mitchell is definitely the best teacher i ever had she is caring motivational and wants you to succeed she is brilliant and gives amazing lectures she can be a tough grader but clearly states what she is looking for be sure to participate in discussions she loves that mam will not only teach you theatre she will teach you life lessons
255,Margaret  Mitchell,mam is inspirational this class was fun and thorough helping me learn about each play we analyzed she never says your answer is wrong but helps steer you into the right direction i would love to take this class again
256,Margaret  Mitchell,mam is the bomb a tough grader but an extremely brilliant woman you can learn so much if you listen and are involved in class do your work show up to class buy the book study for and enjoy the classes she teaches
257,Margaret  Mitchell,she great i love her she tough yet hepfull
258,Margaret  Mitchell,i really learnes tons from her even though she might think otherwise but it was in her classes that i learned what i remember most about college one of the most talented person met
259,Margaret  Mitchell,margaret is great so engaging and has so much to teach she expects a lot so only take her if you are prepared to work working for her is very rewarding learn so much
260,Diane  Reid,she made it easy to give speeches in class loved how she made us do warmups on speech day
261,Diane  Reid,freaking awesome super enthusiastic so never a dull moment she seems to really care about her students i really enjoy her class and would recommend her to anyone
262,Diane  Reid,very sweet lady she is caring and wants to help you the class itself is fun only thing i would change is to not have pop quizzes but its college so kind of silly
263,Diane  Reid,awesome professor who cares about her students she understands that everyone comfortable speaking in front of people very tough grader though only class i get an a in be prepared to work
264,Diane  Reid,she a fair grader offends her students honestly there are way better professors to take rather than her maybe outside of class sea better but probably not she divorced and angry it seems like
265,Diane  Reid,i had reid for s121 and freshman seminar reid was a very understanding and amazing professor she knew that people got jitters speaking in front of crowds and penalize you for it she could tell who put work into their speech and she would grade accordingly always asked questions about your topic and was interested great professor
266,Diane  Reid,she is great very helpful and so enthusiastic about her job she made the class very fun to be in has quizzes about what you talked about in the class the day before has great study guides as well
267,Diane  Reid,she is one of the best professors on campus for someone who did not want to take a speech interpersonal communication class she is very understanding of that the goal is not to embarrass you or call you out but to really help you learn i would def recommend to anyone also i took her class before and she still remembers me on campus
268,Diane  Reid,amazing professor while attendance is not mandatory there is usually an assignment of some quiz etc that is due every class that can not be made up very fair be prepared to earn your grade
269,Diane  Reid,is a good teacher but when it comes to speechs she is a tough grader everything has to be perfect for you to get an a if you are looking for an easy a take this professor
270,Diane  Reid,professor reid is a very nice lady you do have to study but it take too much effort her class was interesting and can help with day to day life i enjoyed her class she is funny
271,Diane  Reid,lots of reading in the book tests were fairly easy professor reid is amazing she made the class fun and enjoyable we got to choose our own topics and the selections were great there is some work to do and turn in for speeches planning reports and preparation outlines but easy once you know what going to talk about
272,Diane  Reid,great teacher she really explains the materials well as long as you attend her class and pay attention to her lectures do great on the tests
273,Diane  Reid,not an easy a must do everything to a t to do well she plays favorites and i was definitely not one my advice would be to get on her good side and you should do well
274,Diane  Reid,her class was simple so simple it was completely boring everything is common sense and nothing deeper if you want a simple class that is uninspiring then it might work for you i did appreciate the absences policy
275,Diane  Reid,i would definitely recommend this professor took her inter comm class and got an a out of it although she is friendly and fun in class do take her deadlines seriously
276,Diane  Reid,great professor she turns an intimidating class into one that you might actually look forward to great classroom environment she is incredibly helpful and a great person but she does have her rules about attendance format etc if you do all the work and pay attention to detail you can pass even if your speeches great take her
277,Diane  Reid,superb professor very helpful and inspirational if you pay attention and work hard in and out of class you can and should be a better speaker by the end sadly only four speeches there were some tape recorded assignments some paper assignments quizzes and two tests paper work is cake if you study study practice practice study practice
278,Diane  Reid,great professor for learning but needs to be more lenient for a level course grades a little too hard on speeches and assigns way too many other assignments and papers besides the speech itself
279,Diane  Reid,reid is a nice overall lady but for a level course the material and work is absurd if possible take another prof tons of busy work
280,John  Cunningham,you show jc the effort and he will respect you back there is a lot of knowledge in his head and a genuine interest in the students once you demonstrate your commitment be freed to take your creations as far as you want to
281,John  Cunningham,his enthusiasm was contagious and i even appreciated his quirks i still display those brass and copper mobiles in my living room judging from the other ratings i was very lucky to get on his good side
282,John  Cunningham,so confusing because he says he wants you to be creative but then shoots down your ideas he tells you exactly how he wants it done even though its your art no real free will in the class you basically are only learning his style of art
283,John  Cunningham,jc is an interesting guy but a terrible teacher makes you feel like you have to do what he wants on your own projects says everything should be simple but then wishes you had put more effort in when the finished project elaborate spends forever explaining gave me though i followed his directions exactly and took all his suggestions
284,John  Cunningham,whoa this man is kind of crazy expect to put a lot of work into his class and not really understand what he is saying does not believe in grade inflation like the rest of the world
285,John  Cunningham,i love jc obvious that he loves what he does and is always really excited about it i know sometimes it seems that he wants to implement his ideas on the students but he really does know what talking about he really wants his students to do well and always there fore support and guidance i find him hilarious he does too
286,John  Cunningham,at the lower levels form and space jc was confusing and frustrating to have as a teacher however i found him to be a great guy and an even better professor when he is teaching a smaller and more advanced class although boring at times he teaches technical aspects to sculpture that cannot be matched if you do the work you will be rewarded
287,John  Cunningham,played favorites would spend minutes helping one person and minute helping another always said he wanted your creation to be simple but always favored the elaborate projects acted as if projects were very openended but then acted as if they had to be done his way
288,John  Cunningham,has a problem accepting other ideas loves work to be geared toward engineering appearance and simplistic hates color and extravagant projects then again he has big expectations for every project and spends hours elaborating on how he wants it done exactly
289,John  Cunningham,no comments
290,John  Cunningham,as long as you do exactly what he wants you to do on your pieces he is fine huge ego worst teacher i ever think he fabricated the pyramids or something
291,John  Cunningham,he discover how the pyramids were built or something
292,John  Cunningham,he discover how the pyramids were built or something
293,John  Cunningham,i really like the class because when i tried to come up with ideas mine were shot down and he gave me a new one i felt like i had to go with anyways i did alright in the class but i happy with the way he guided my ideas so much
294,John  Cunningham,awful moody and plays favorites
295,John  Cunningham,no comments
296,John  Cunningham,do not be fooled by his seemingly nice appearance he is an evil selfabsorbed tyrant professor galt is much better and more openminded
297,John  Cunningham,hard to get used to but knows his stuff and will help you more than any other skiddie art prof
298,John  Cunningham,worst art teacher i have ever had loved himself discouraged all creativity we disagreed on one project and he was unbeleviably rude to me and because of our disagreement he almost failed dont ever take a class with this awful im and art major and i have never been so disgusted
299,John  Cunningham,excellent
300,Wolfgang  Ziller,takes time to provide useful examples
301,Wolfgang  Ziller,no comments
302,Wolfgang  Ziller,the subject matter easy but ziller did a good job of taking the time to explain anything we understand
303,Wolfgang  Ziller,funny russian accent and cool guy great examples in physics for calculus problems found lectures really interesting using maple programs in class very helpful in office hours and was available outside of class for questions really nice math prof
304,Clark,i studied more for this one class than all my classes combined and i am a pharmacy major i received the highest grades on the midterm and final out of people in the class and he still gave me a b how does anyone get an a im glad i heard he left or hopefully fired he does not care about the students yet about boosting his ego
305,Clark,because of this professor i am suffering from depression please switch as soon as possible in the begining of the semester i came on this site to check his ratings i though hey maybe he is not bad i will give him a chance god only if i had dropped the class in the begining i have an f on my transcript
306,Clark,i usually listen to what people say on this thing but what they say about him is right everytime i think about this teacher i get a weird headache and i feel depressed or angry i even now no joke try your best to switch out
307,Clark,please just whatever you do do not under any cirumstances take this professor he is a very difficult teacher he wants you to think like a physicist the problem is that we students think like a physicists because duh we are not physicists
308,Clark,he teach you besides his own crap that make any sense you must learn on your own with the textbook but must follow his own way of teaching he help you at all in the lab and claims that he has no office hours his questions are similar to the textbook on the midterm but the final is a diff case final say
309,Clark,he is crazy he wants to learn a chapter a week the midterm was six question for chapters and the final questions for to chapters if it is not done the format he wants it to be it is wrong no matter what please stay away any teacher is better than him trust me especially for pharmacy majors you will end up repeating it again
310,Clark,pharmacy majors wrong guy take somebody else especialy if you have to take organic chemistry with this class
311,Clark,he is very easy he always tries to scare his student at the beggining but just like the nazi regime fell so will he and in the process i got an a dont let him intimidate you also i dropped the class after i found out he was teaching so you should do the same
312,Clark,no comments
313,Clark,very hard teacher hard to pass most you can get is b exams are very difficult
314,Clark,he is so anal go back to boston we dont need u ur supposed to be a teacher yet we are not learing anything man u dont have passion in wht u do i think u should retire or reborn
315,Clark,hardest teacher help his students only students out of actually took the final in his class take him
316,Sally  Mallory,awful unfair and partial to stushe her favorites and totally fake never take her if possible
317,Sally  Mallory,dr mallory is a great teacher she is genuinely interested in all her students and makes it a point to learn name in the entire orgo lab
318,Sally  Mallory,orgo lab takes alot of time just a credit and you spend to hours in lab lab reports are lengthy and requires alot of work also exams every few labs difficult to keep up with lab and exams take this single lab and no other lab
319,Deirdre  O\' Shea,is a easy professor is you do all of the online work rude when you try to approach her outside of class her power points very helpful and her lectures do not help at all her directions when writing papers are very clear but it is still difficult to receive a good score on them the work is all online quizzes and essays
320,Deirdre  O\' Shea,is an easy professor if you already know how to write a paper and able to commit your whole life to her class her inclass powerpoints and lecture does not match causing you to choose between what she is saying and her slide to take notes however its an easy a because its all online i never went to class and ended with a a
321,Deirdre  O\' Shea,this professor seems to think that students can and should read her mind trying to write a paper for her is like trying to hit an invisible target her directions are vague yet her expectations when grading are very specific and annoyingly subjective she is also unnecessarily loud made a habit of wearing earplugs to class
322,Deirdre  O\' Shea,she is a wonderful professor and you can tell that she is knowledgeable about history she makes the class interesting and i ended the class with an a with flying colors make sure to follow her essay prompts do the inquisitive and have the book open for the test she also gives bonus points so a plus great
323,Deirdre  O\' Shea,class structure is great honestly just do the online homework exams and papers if you try to speak with her outside of office ours even if before or after class she talk to you and is quite rude about it feedback through emails are short and obviously rude lectures and powerpoints are very nonspecific and all over the place
324,Deirdre  O\' Shea,this professor is probably the worst history professor i have ever had her lectures are all over the place and carry little to no structure a straight a student and taking this class just for the credit so many people would send one friend to sign the attendance for them make this review the reason you sign up for her class
325,Deirdre  O\' Shea,she is a very good professor funny and really knows what she is talking about be ready to write several papers with vague guidelines
326,Deirdre  O\' Shea,she was the best history teacher ever had in my life she was fair in her grading and even gave us extra credit multiple times i usually am not good at history but her lectures were actually so interesting she captures your attention and if you go to class she helps you understand the essay prompts and suggests general ideas
327,Deirdre  O\' Shea,the questions for the papers are poorly defined and can lead to a lot of confusion when writing them fair grader very boring class you have to read the book online so there is very little reason to go to her class
328,Deirdre  O\' Shea,a hilarious teacher with a sense of passion for what she does ask her about the most interesting roman leader and she will talk your ear off papers are tough but put in the time and get a good grade need the textbook for the papers overall an awesome professor
329,Deirdre  O\' Shea,i honestly think this class was pretty hard definitely go to all classes if you are not a history person even though attendance matter lectures are kind of all over the place and i felt like some of the info didnt flow well
330,Deirdre  O\' Shea,a weird class in my opinion was confused a lot of the time and not sure how all topics related to each other but her class is set up pretty clearly she gives reviews the class before the test and is pretty much exactly on it the prompts are hard to grasp for papers but i never got lower than an on one recommend still
331,Deirdre  O\' Shea,she is funny in a sarcastic way lectures are all over the place because she is clearly passionate about her class but the tests are easy with minimal studying and before every exam she does a review
332,Deirdre  O\' Shea,great professor very enthusiastic and cares about her students she is so genuine and nice i hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy her tests are easy if you go to the review she tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test she give out on her essays but its ok overall great woman
333,Deirdre  O\' Shea,i loved professor she was great her lectures could be a bit boring sometimes but she always tried to keep everyone engaged in class she gives essays and tests and noncumulative final the tests are easy she gives a review but the essays can be a bit difficult she can be a tough grader on the essays easy to get a b on them
334,Deirdre  O\' Shea,loves history passionate but is an extremely tough grader on her four essays most people attended class only for tests power points posted online but you would have read for extra materialdetails extremely organized
335,Deirdre  O\' Shea,professor is very smart and she knows what talking shes also very passionate about history so her lectures are very detailed her mannerisms are hilarious and i would love to take her class again she grades a little tough on papers but not too bad papers exams including the final which cumulative
336,Deirdre  O\' Shea,is an amazing teacher really gets into her lectures and captures your interest as if she is telling you a story in class four essays need the textbook to have successful papers tests are easy attendance mandatory but go to the review sessions before the test she basically tells you whats going to be on them great class
337,Deirdre  O\' Shea,i loved her as a professor really nice woman tests hard although the essays can be difficult but take it to her office hours and have her read it she will tell you what needs to be fix gives opportunities for extra credit here and there
338,Deirdre  O\' Shea,professor was an awesome and easy professor four papers tests and the final which cumulative she is a pretty easy grader majority of the class got on papers class mandatory she just lectures about the book so you can just read the book instead really easy class no homework either
339,Robin  Hochstrasser,an icon in his field personable with excellent taste
340,Robin  Hochstrasser,he might know his material but he makes no effort to let the students learn
341,Robin  Hochstrasser,p chem can be challenging to remember all those formulas and equations hochstrasser may not be the best but definitely challenged us takehome exam tough and so was do lots of problems until you memorized eqn
342,Rich  Carter,terrible professor not clear includes too much information unwilling to listen to questions in class
343,Rich  Carter,his class is fun and interesting the test is fair every thing is covered during lectures overall he is a great teacher i would recommand him for anyone
344,Rich  Carter,he is awesome i love going to his class every day i know some people say he goes very fast but he takes the time to answer questions and makes sure that every body is clear because he talks fast his class keeps me focused and alert and excited as long as you take the time after class to look through the material you would do great
345,Rich  Carter,he expects way too much mechanisms for the final are you kidding me he does not realize that impossible to test everything on an exam he will have a question about everything very few people finish the tests in time because they are excessively difficult and he goes over info in his lectures way too fast too bad he is the only choice
346,Rich  Carter,this guy is an absolute amazing professor he taught the subject so well and i learned more in one day of his lecture then a whole term with walker the best o chem professor at osu but not the easiest
347,Rich  Carter,overall a good teacher he does notes via chalkboard though and post slides on blackboard so basically you have to go to class people say that he crams you with mechanism information but that is what ochem is chemical mechanisms i thought he did a very good job teaching difficult material definitely buy the book though
348,Rich  Carter,good teacher attend class and take good notes im pretty sure he drinks red bulls before lecture he during lecture
349,Rich  Carter,as far as his teaching ability goes it is not too bad dr carter is very experienced in the field however his requirements are ridiculous asks direct questions from previous terms it is extremely hard to even pass the class i do not recommend him
350,Rich  Carter,i did terrible in organic chemistry the first time i took the course i took it again with dr carter and i got an a mechanisms are a huge part of he always asked students if he needed to slow down and no one spoke up he was always willing to help and made it interesting best organic chemistry professor take his class
351,Rich  Carter,talks too fast for lectures tries to be funny but grades tough on exams limited office hours and overall not recommended
352,Rich  Carter,he thinks cramming a whole bunch of mechanisms is the way of learning ochem lack of clear explanation and talks in light speed he grades hard too not recommended
353,Rich  Carter,first ever received worked hard but his use of blackboard and no lecture notes killed me by the time i was done copying off the board he had explained the concept and moved on to the next one took myles the next term and got a b
354,Rich  Carter,best organic chemistry teacher at oregon state
355,Rich  Carter,professor carter is a great professor if willing to work hard lectures consist mostly of taking notes as dr carter writes them on the board but occasionally he will tell stories related to what teaching very consistent in making sure that if we learn something one way he tests us that way great professor and very helpful
356,Rich  Carter,very nice and generous professor considering he was also submitting a major grant during our class term he is very clear about what will be on midterms does not offer review sessions
357,Rich  Carter,he needs to slow down let students ask more questions he thinks cramming you full of mechanisms will somehow make you understand it has hardly any office hours and just impossible to reach if you email him exactly the way he tells you to he respond the questions on the tests are fair but the grading is ridiculously harsh
358,Rich  Carter,a really arrogent person thinks he knows it all not interested in helping students only interested in keeping his time with you to a minimum
359,Rich  Carter,if you arent an encyclopedia of exact perfect mrchanisms catalytic cycles and structs you will loose millions of points for trite mistakes and not be rewarded in any way for what you have learned or put reasonable amounts of work and thought into given the choice i would never take a class from him again
360,Rich  Carter,no comments
361,Rich  Carter,he is very boring and overall not a good teacher
362,Mara  Merlino,assignments are ridiculously above soc level they are very unclear and constantly changing unbelieveably boring speaker rambles on about bizarre personal life if she says she will do soemthing she will not come through please would the faculty do something before she ruins more interest in sociology
363,Mara  Merlino,know how to teach at all she expects you to read her mind bother to ask her questions in class she know the answers she likes to ramble on about her personal experiences easy a stupid assignments horrible teacher
364,Michael  Scarlatos,save yourself the headache if you are late probably sit in the corner with a dunce hat make people sit along the wall if they were late he spontaneously picks on people it just gets annoying the day he lectures on his life from age time feel like you never graduated h.s or that in the twilight zone
365,Michael  Scarlatos,hard in any eco class i took using only book examples and jokes no real life exposure worst economics prof pace has to offer
366,Michael  Scarlatos,hard everything no review i mean it run
367,Michael  Scarlatos,has no respect for anyone not a teacher but a clocker should do something else in his career awful professor exams are mc and tricky gives no partial credit stay away
368,Michael  Scarlatos,the most incompetent and offensive you will ever encounter in your life stay away from this professor and you should have a rewarding college experience
369,Michael  Scarlatos,a truly horrible professor very unhelpful not available after class insults his students does not know the material makes many mistakes while going over reviews for tests only gives two tests during the semester which the class grade is besed solely on i give michael scarlatos an f grade
370,Michael  Scarlatos,one of the worst professors of the past century
371,Michael  Scarlatos,bad attitude bad professor what else is there to say
372,Michael  Scarlatos,this guy sucks trust me dont waste your time if you have any shred of individuality he will put you down and glorify his stupidity complete waste of time he should have been fired a long long long time ago happy new year
373,Michael  Scarlatos,he is so intimidating and he makes his students afraid to particiapte in his class i like him at all and i would advise anyone who gets him to are better ones out there
374,Michael  Scarlatos,had my share of bad professors at pace but by far the worst prof he teach or know how to teach whatever his case is a jerk who enjoys seeing the students sweat by constantly putting you on the spot
375,Michael  Scarlatos,i agree with everyone such a bad teacher actually he redefines the terms of a bad professor worst prof ever mean and seeks to humiliate his students
376,Michael  Scarlatos,hard to understand and help you out exams midterm and final exams are hard i got my first and only d in this class
377,Michael  Scarlatos,took him a while back left with a c and tred very hard reason why my gpa suffered he doesnt teach well and his exams are just brutal if he is the last teacher available wait until next semester
378,Michael  Scarlatos,i am a student from baruch college i took his class in spring i admit he is the worst professor in the world check what baruch students say about him terrible
379,Michael  Scarlatos,jesus christ of nazareth i have never seen a bad teacher in my life until i took his class he is just there for the paycheck please run if you can
380,Michael  Scarlatos,dropped the class after seeing syllabus class have much students to begin with
381,Michael  Scarlatos,stinko
382,Michael  Scarlatos,horrible man i hate him so much take him care about students
383,Michael  Scarlatos,get out of pace
384,Tina  Keeble,mean unapproachable unhelpful
385,Tina  Keeble,ok i change my mind i thought she was cool but no she is only friendly with her favorite students i never got the ta job even with my super high gpa very rude cold and unapproachable never get your lab reviewed by her she takes off marks
386,Tina  Keeble,very helpful was the key to success for ma240 would have failed without her
387,Tina  Keeble,tinas labs are better than trevors
388,Tina  Keeble,condesending mean wants to see people fail some ridiculous ideas if you can avoid her do it
389,Tina  Keeble,condescending arrogant back off lady you only have a ba absolutely no sense of humour turned red in the face yelling at me because i made fun of one of her stuipd assignments good luck if you have her need it
390,Tina  Keeble,tries her best to make calculus as comprehensible as possible nice
391,Tina  Keeble,no comments
392,Tina  Keeble,what a condescending person so not approachable
393,Tina  Keeble,very helpful in labs very approachable easy to talk to explains very nicely
394,Tina  Keeble,no comments
395,Eleanor  Branch,slow to respond online could have been due to small class size so less priority but still
396,Eleanor  Branch,she grades tough i had another teach re grade papers and the grades where very different
397,Eleanor  Branch,her class was offered to me through apus she was very helpful though there were quite a bit of essays and you truly had to try for your grade we also had to read a novel chosen from her list for the final essay but her grading on the final essay was very lenient
398,Eleanor  Branch,dr branch was a difficult teacher to work with although she was helpful when it came to projects the answers were usually vague and not direct when grading i felt as if she graded based off of personal opinion rather than the facts that were clearly on the paper helps you to become a good writer but not a great one
399,Eleanor  Branch,i took almost everything that branch taught guilford college a few years ago i thought that she was the most thoughtprovoking engaging scholar she was also very approachable and genuinely invested in the success of her students she inspired and still inspires me to go deeper novels articles other forms of research were our textbooks
400,Eleanor  Branch,incredible teacher of postcolonial literary criticism
401,Eleanor  Branch,great professor yes everything is about race but that is just where she focuses her interest she has her opinions but is willing to listen to yours as long as they are backed up well
402,Eleanor  Branch,she says kinda sorta a whole lot and that bothered me but if you dont mind people that use the same catch phrase over and over again she is a good teacher you can learn a lot from her
403,Eleanor  Branch,i loved the class i took with her and i thought she was a great teacher
404,Eleanor  Branch,was open about her own opinions so we could start off an honest class discussion as equals unlike certain other english professors she embraced different views on the text as long as they were sufficiently supported
405,Eleanor  Branch,eleanor intimidated the hell out of me when i first had her smart can defend her views and expects the same out of you beware the eyebrow of death once i got to know her she was charming warm and blindingly intelligent though she focuses on race i never felt i was evil for being white or that i was graded down for disagreeing
406,Eleanor  Branch,like class white people i never felt like she was taking me seriously i agree with the previous poster she can be catty everything had to do with race in her class it got old fast other literature to read other than stuff on race
407,Eleanor  Branch,had the engl102 course with her as a transfer student and quite frankly the lady can be rather catty overall however if you can support your views adequately she is quite open minded to voices of dissent in the classroom also take her
408,Eleanor  Branch,i had race in america and although we differed on our views she was clear on her views and on her expectations for the class
409,Virgina  Rivers,great class i learned so much and the professor was fantastic she even gives you an excellent study list prior to major exams i found her course to be enjoyable the labs were fun too however it is not a course for lazy students you must study
410,Virgina  Rivers,took this class online teacher have much communication with students all book work with quizzes midterm and final were weighted huge and were on campus felt lucky to skate by with a c based on basically teaching yourself
411,Virgina  Rivers,very good teacher took her class online while deployed and was very understanding and helpful with my situation went out of her way to help out
412,Virgina  Rivers,read the book go to lecture pay attention go to the labs do something in the labs turn in the assignments in other words just do what you should be doing in any class you will at least pass if you do this much
413,Virgina  Rivers,horrible teacher
414,Virgina  Rivers,very teacher would normally be an easy class she refuses to help you with any concerns and copies quizzes from an online database that go along with the book leading to a high percentage of low scores
415,Mulloy  Robertson,very confusing professor he will go on a tangent about cars golf wrestling and friends for the entire class and it becomes entirely pointless to show up when he just confuses you more i will say he is very helpful when it comes to extending due dates on homework and quizzes if you talk to him about it so not entirely bad
416,Mulloy  Robertson,awesome instructor will not hold your hand thru the course and give you easy grade but very helpful funny does all he can to get students up to speed on trigonometry even in week course he gets to the point so we learn what we need would take this instructor again in a heartbeat the course was fast he made it fun and understandable
417,Mulloy  Robertson,can be all over the place when teaching i gave up on taking notes the first week into class makes a lot of references to cars taxes and being arrested try to have another professor if you need to take precal
418,Mulloy  Robertson,cool teacher but wack teaching methods
419,Mulloy  Robertson,nice funny understanding about needing extensions on dates lectures are uselessread the book and use online tools instead he appears to have adhd either is redirecting because he understand the material or simply want to teach he keeps changing what he meant to talks about friends cars not math
420,Mulloy  Robertson,he was really nice but did not seem to care about teaching or his students he makes an effort to explain and just meet the mark i knew more going into his class then i did leaving it he makes a lot of references to cars and real life that do not really make sense when discussing calculus i would not recommend taking him
421,Mulloy  Robertson,do not take this teacher if he has any idea what doing which i doubt then he does a horrible way of explaining it all he does is act confused change his mind and say random things that make sense
422,Mulloy  Robertson,he is a nice guy but did not explain subject matter well i had to go buy several books to selfteach practically moved into the math lab he does go on tangents and only explains how to do the simplistic part of a problem not good when the math lab tutors know what teacher you have by how confused you are nice guy but not thorough enough
423,Mulloy  Robertson,online class could take quizzes and tests over until you make a just manage your time so you can do that not much help when you email him you allowed to see the midterm or final and my grades were very low compared to tests so i suspicious about the answers one test have them all loaded into the system not good to me
424,Mulloy  Robertson,understand why these people like him very understanding if you need to make up and gives you partial credit on tests if you got the wrong answer but were headed in the right direction i loved his class
425,Mulloy  Robertson,mr robertson is one of the worst math teachers ever his teaching methods are strange all he does is go into tangents that have no relation to the work his tests are very difficult including the final the only good thing about him is his ability to work with you if you miss overall bad teacher
426,Mulloy  Robertson,horrible unless you like a drill sargent all i ever head him talk about is the pressure to get out of his class if you ask for clarification you get a quick response not to the question you asked and walks away then he spends time helping one other student for the entire period.if you have math anxiety he is probably the worst choice
427,Mulloy  Robertson,worst math teacher possible he was lazy his class was absolutely useless if you have a question about the math even try he constantly gets off topic and brings up things that have nothing to do with math usually sports or cars the subject is hard enough for most of us without him complicating it take him
428,Mulloy  Robertson,he is incomprehensible and pretty lazy he has someone make out his notes and then gets confused by them he was pretty funny only because he would talk about completely useless things such as golfing so if you take him please learn your book will be your best friend
429,Mulloy  Robertson,he is the worst teacher i have ever had he is unbelievably unorganized and his teacheing style is beyond confusing i had already learned all we did in class and needed a refresher but he taught it in a way that made it confusing and completely messed me up he hates to teach and that is apparent in his lectures do not take him
430,Mulloy  Robertson,is very confusing and loses himself when lecturing he does not explain things well and then when he goes over a test he tells you little tricks you can use which he should tell you when he is explaining how to do the math problems talks alot in class about tangent things that do not apply to math like how hot the cashier that waited on him
431,Mulloy  Robertson,i liked him
432,Mulloy  Robertson,he is horrible do not take him if you can his tests are very hard and nothing is multiple choice and he has other students grade his work because he he has even lost students work
433,Mulloy  Robertson,its not as bad as everyone complains its actually easy just do the work teach is very helpful under and above the table
434,Mulloy  Robertson,he was a horrible teacher he never helps you also all his tests are do it yourself no fill in the blank or multiple choice its all on you own he always relies on attendance and he has other students grade his work for him because he does not have the time to do it himself i would not recommend anyone to take him as an instructor
435,Dana  Baylard,one of my favorite teachers she is fun to be in class with and is very helpful with all the questions i would defintely have her as a teacher again
436,Dana  Baylard,i had fun in her class and suprisingly enjoy the essay part make sure you stay on schedule with the essays because they can be overwhelming if you become behind her personality is very interesting she can be a little airheaded at times and just laugh at her jokes as if they are actually funny
437,Dana  Baylard,dr baylard is the coolest teacher ever really understanding and answers all your questions very promptly she is also very easy going about attendence and class behavior but you sleep here hilarious even lets you turn in paper weeks late some grade her down on showing up but had unavoidable family health problems
438,Dana  Baylard,i could have learned more from a trained monkey she was absent for the last month of class she provided very little communication about what was going on and left the class in limbo she then graded our paper after her return we lost the chance to revise our papers as stated in the syliby
439,Dana  Baylard,this is a great class a year later i still remember everything i learned i had a four hour one day class with her and did not hate going you should deffinatly take her for english
440,Dana  Baylard,ms baylard makes learning english enjoyable if wondering what english professor to take baylard is the best
441,Dana  Baylard,she explains everything in great detail until everyone understands what it is they need to
442,Dana  Baylard,great class dana made english an enjoyable subject
443,Dana  Baylard,she is awesome lots of essays but they are fun ones and she is great
444,Dana  Baylard,she is awsome you go wrong with this teacher
445,Dana  Baylard,quality teaching with an upbeat attitude a winner
446,Dana  Baylard,no comments
447,Dana  Baylard,taking her lit class right now very interesting and tries hard to keep the class interested and attentive
448,Dana  Baylard,can often act too silly or goofy while teaching and will stray away from the lesson goes off topic a lot not good with words nor is she really understanding
449,Dana  Baylard,if seeking a compassionate professor you have found one with baylard clearly take an interest in student welfare easy to access outside of class and helps polish writing skills
450,Dana  Baylard,good professor
451,Dana  Baylard,no comments
452,Dana  Baylard,she definitely grows on you if you stick with the class challenging but very worth it
453,Dana  Baylard,she is a hard professors but so extremely great she gave me a love of english i had never had before i worked my butt off but earned an a the best english teacher i ever had
454,Mima  Petrovic,no
455,Mima  Petrovic,i really enjoyed learning in this class mima is very knowledgable and presented course topics with amazing enthusiasm i think enjoy this course but i really liked the way it was taught she is very caring and will give you the results you want as long as you put in the effort she expects
456,Mima  Petrovic,mima is a classic lecturer she truly is passionate about her field she is rather dull though and does not get to know her students in tutorial we had to use name cards the entire semester of a tutorial of essay is extremely straightforward however the final exam should have been a take home memorize passages and detailed content
457,Mima  Petrovic,the course itself uses no textbook so she has her own slides she posts the comes directly from these slides she is not a easy marker but a fair marker if you write a b grade answer expect that grade read those slides and expect an or higher also she adjusts deadlines and grades if need be overall very kind professor
458,Mima  Petrovic,this was prove that history is useless and should be spent studying on while leisure
459,Mima  Petrovic,if i could i would pick mima percent again as a professor shes very decent nice and understanding attendance is a must in order to get the marks
460,Mima  Petrovic,mima is a terrific teacher very helpful and treats her students with respect anyone who has her as a teacher is lucky
461,Mima  Petrovic,it seems as if the only people who like her lecture style are kids coming straight out of high school and looking to be entertained and have information handed to them she has a classical lecture style and she is very well versed in her field and open to questions understanding of busy schedules more than willing to help her students
462,Mima  Petrovic,easiest course ever just watched movies and compared them had a multiple midterm and essay exam and you get percent for showing up
463,Mima  Petrovic,this course is taught in conjunction with david rondel and he is amazing mima however although she is a sweet lady is not an engaging lecturer and her lectures are very difficult to pay attention to because of this definitely wish this course was only taught by rondel
464,Mima  Petrovic,a really nice lady and very approachable definitively try to help you out if you have any questions her class notes were a bit confusing to follow but she does her best to explain them more clearly in the tutorials overall a good teacher but tends to be confusing sometimes
465,Mima  Petrovic,good but not that helpful
466,Mima  Petrovic,a first year and i found her really helpful and easy to come to with any concerns she is really nice and seems passionate about what she is talking matter with lectures whether or not you come to class.if you pay attention should be able to do really well
467,Mima  Petrovic,she is nice and easy going actually she does not trick you with the and its pretty obvious on what you will be tested on she is a fair marker though so she hard but she exactly easy either
468,Mima  Petrovic,the sweetest most caring professor encounter her passion for the material is infectious and she always tries to make tutorials interesting readings are mandatory in this class in fact the tutorials are more important than lecture clear on expectations but not an easy ride mima is a gold standard professor
469,Mima  Petrovic,fair and knows what talking about lectures are inconsistent sometimes she hides behind the podium and other times she is engaged and charismatic buy the textbook you can get away with just going to class i liked her and would take her again
470,Mima  Petrovic,she knows what she is talking about she is very clear this is exactly how a history class is supposed to be her tests are very easy
471,Mima  Petrovic,she hids behind a podium reads from her notes the whole class and has next to no interaction with the class you have to go to her lectures as they are exactly the same notes that she posts online as my first taste of a university level history class i can say that i am not impressed anless u plan on a hst major dont take this class
472,Mima  Petrovic,she is a great prof very liberal and approachable no need to buy textbook just study wikipedia for the exams everything is good except there is a long assignment to do
473,Mima  Petrovic,
474,Joan  Krone,she cares about students tries to be helpful but sometimes she gives feedback the class is lectureheavy for a practical class software engineering the lectures are kinda boring she often uses words which sometimes give the impression that she know what talking about or have reallife experience
475,Joan  Krone,she has no interpersonal skills at all
476,Joan  Krone,this teacher is not effective i graduated with a computer science degree from denison and work in the industry now she had no grasp of the material and if she did was not able to convey it clearly when she retires i will begin donating money to denison
477,Joan  Krone,i really like joan krone as a person she is nice and helpful she is not very good at structuring a class but the discussions we had were for the most part good good at letting students set their own agenda and independent study types of things
478,Joan  Krone,she is a very nice person and easy to talk to but is also very flighty and vague about her lessons she spent the entire class helping students who were either cs majors or knew way more than most of the students one of the books is written by her and is missing half the program for each program take this unless you plan to major in cs
479,Joan  Krone,joan krone is an interesting person this is not to say that you should take her class if you are planning on being a cs major and have a background in programming she can help you out she however has no ability to grasp that not every student has the same knowledge coming into class
480,Joan  Krone,if you ask her a question answer it
481,Joan  Krone,bad teacher unclear seemed to be confused could not explain worth anything i learned more from my brother in minutes than i did from her the entire semester say about half the class dropped
482,Joan  Krone,in response to a previous rating the drop info does not say all thta much simply because many students get into computer science not fully understanding what they are getting into dr krone is a fabulous professor on the texts cs171 uses common on
483,Joan  Krone,the drop information says it all as an intro class this is nearly impossible because she help you even if you ask the books that we buy are hers and they are error filled and no as helpful as online sites although she will let you drop
484,Nancy  Jones,not good at lecture makes material more confusing than needs to be she is very accessible and will work with you if she that you are trying which is her best quality on exams tends to put material that was briefly discussed
485,Nancy  Jones,nancy would ask us to explain some phenomenon and we would always say shielding which was the correct but lazy answer in every case and she got wise and started requiring us to defend that answer since then never given an answer i defend in any medium on any topic instead of for defriending me on facebook
486,Nancy  Jones,one of my favorite teachers always willing to help you and is available after class if having trouble definitely recommend taking her
487,Nancy  Jones,very rude her lessons are very confusing and unclear if you know the correct answer during class when teaching something new really rude about it and makes you feel stupid in front of the entire class her scoring is random and her attitude sucks
488,Nancy  Jones,she made chemistry easy and understandable disappointed that she teaching chm
489,Nancy  Jones,amazing she presents the material in a way understandable answers every question and does practice problems hw every night questions tests too hard and really friendly
490,Nancy  Jones,wonderful professor was struggling in the beginning she took her time made sure i understood what she was talking about if you can take her whenever possible

502,Nancy  Jones,dr jones is the best teacher ever
503,Nancy  Jones,very good teacher extremely knowledgeable always willing to help
504,Jim  Pletcher,professor pletcher provided me with two classes during my time at denison university as an exchange student behind a fairly tough facade hides a wonderfully engaged intelligent and brilliant teacher and professor his classes were inspiring and insightful and instrumental for me in determing my academic path pletcher comes highly recommded
505,Jim  Pletcher,he is a very mediocre teacher and seem to interact well with other students he acts like political science is hard when it really
506,Jim  Pletcher,i would have to agree with the comments below he is really ineffective and rigid not very personable either i would try to avoid him
507,Jim  Pletcher,one of the worst teachers at denison he is very arrogant and really needs to retire
508,Jim  Pletcher,pletcher is a brilliant professor but i look forward to his class he runs our freshman seminar like a posc he also read student essays only accept rewrites and averages the two grades overall interesting guy but demanding all around with some ineffective policies
509,Jim  Pletcher,do not take him
510,Jim  Pletcher,best professor i have had at denison extremely clear and interesting in class he is also very helpful out of class i have never met anyone so knowledgeable
511,Jim  Pletcher,he is really arrogant and unfair not a very good teacher avoid at all costs
512,Jim  Pletcher,great professorbest at denison
513,Jim  Pletcher,the man will make you work for your grade however in the end if you do not know the information it is simply because you are not paying attention or reading the man laids things out for you so clearly that sometimes you wonder if you are truly doing the work he is that damn good you would enjoy his class
514,Jim  Pletcher,this man is a genius the class itself is extremely hard and not my major or anything and my first polisci class so i have trouble with it but really good about explaining things if you ask i thought hate the class just because so hard but i because pletcher rocks
515,Jim  Pletcher,extremely intelligent
516,Jim  Pletcher,i agree the best teacher i had at denison i learned more in his classes than any others
517,Jim  Pletcher,best prof on campus
518,Jim  Pletcher,makes you work like crazy to earn your grade but you learn so much and a really fair grader which is always good
519,Jim  Pletcher,no comments
520,Jim  Pletcher,ipe hard class but man i learned a lot by the end of the semester great guy too
521,Jim  Pletcher,his way or the highway get out while you still can
522,Anita  Hampton,she is not helpful
523,Anita  Hampton,all she does is stand in front of a computer moniter and reads off the powerpoint the class is not interesting
524,Anita  Hampton,i had ms hampton this past spring and i must say it was quite a challenge i can see why people may say that she really interact as much with the students during class but on the other hand i have to say that she is extremely smart she definitely knows her info i received an a but it did not come easy overall she was a fairly desce
525,Anita  Hampton,she is the worst grader ever she felt sick for half of the ok but she grade my research paper and by some other which cost my gpa to go way down defenitely not good dont take know what she is teaching
526,Anita  Hampton,she is the worst teacher that i have ever taken please do not take her she talks too fast and reads straight out of the book i did not learn anything
527,Anita  Hampton,like someone else said avoid her at all costs she is very bright and knows her subjects well but she is not good at teaching or writing test questions she does not use outlines or review questions you will either sink and most do or swim avoid
528,Anita  Hampton,everything i learned in micro i had to learn myself she basically just sits at the front of class and reads the textbook to you all her lectures taught me is what to focus on for the test sort of she was never there for office hours never availab
529,Anita  Hampton,excellent she challenges you all the way through and will help you make if you dont give up she is worth the pain you will learn alot from her she is great i took her for bio also
530,Anita  Hampton,ms hampton is perhaps the only teacher that challenged me to my utmost ability at gpc if you are used to being spoon fed she aint for you if you are the type who loves challenge i challenge you to take her she is very fair helpful and interesting
531,Anita  Hampton,i will advise you to wait for years for a better instructure rather than to take her class she is inexperienced and does not answer questions correctly rather she will give the question for an xtra credit what a nightmare she is
532,Anita  Hampton,oh my gosh i just turned in my final and i take this class if i were you dont get me wrong now she knows her biology but i think as far as her method of teaching and testing she sucks i think the whole class failed b and below
533,Anita  Hampton,she is an inexperienced professor who basically reads an outline and poses questions to the class throughout class the worst part is that if most of the class failed a quiz or every class she was totally callous indifferent avoid her
534,Panos  Alexakos,great prof he really made me think about life and how i think about things he challenged me to venture outside the box and question what i believe and why as objectively as i could really showed me how closedminded i was this class is a must for first years essays hard just incorporate what he talks about in lecture read the books
535,Panos  Alexakos,you must read the assigned reading you must otherwise the tests will be more difficult than they have to be and you understand his lectures as easily he will also try and scare you out of his class in the beginning but be fooled only if you are willing to attend should you take this class excellent teacher
536,Panos  Alexakos,this was possibly the best possible intro to philosophy class i could have taken the material was presented in a way that made it easy to apply the concepts to real life panos really makes the material come alive and if you open your mind at all you will do great and leave with at least a new perspective on life do the reading
537,Panos  Alexakos,he knows what talking about and enjoys teaching his class he has a somewhat rude manner but take it personally i was intimidated to talk to him at first but when i finally did he helped out a lot just pay attention read and take good notes
538,Panos  Alexakos,belittling and rude because he knows what the hell talking about and you pay attention take notes from what he says and on the board ask questions if you understand something or want clarity
539,Panos  Alexakos,great instructor big on class participation do the reading and take good notes on what he says not just what is on the board some greek language needed to retain but not much be thick skinned because he can make you feel small but know that everyone there is exactly the same
540,Panos  Alexakos,great teacher if you pay attention and you are actually interested in philosophy most of the kids in my class who failed never paid attention you must be a good note taker and take notes about what he says not what he writes on the board great class though very useful really makes you think
541,Panos  Alexakos,alexakos is one of the most interesting professors at santa fe really gets you interested in the material and explains it in a way that everybody can understand class is really tough and there is a strict attendance policy but going to class will be not a problem very interested in philosophy after this class highly recommended
542,Panos  Alexakos,if you enjoy participating in class you have to be thickskinned pannos is a great teacher but if you give him the exact answer he is looking for he can be really dismissive not personal just his manner he is extremely knowledgeable but the only point of view that really matters is his own
543,Panos  Alexakos,alexakos is one of the best teachers had at santa fe i took philosophy my first semester and failed so i was dreading round but he is so passionate about the material and so approachable in and out of class the assignments and tests are easy and he loves to help with the word essays assigned throughout the semester
544,Panos  Alexakos,he is not interested in your commentary on the test or vague questions that leave other students looking for the blackberry ask only questions that will help you or others understand the material and you will be fine if you are interested in hearing yourself talk go somewhere else
545,Panos  Alexakos,he teaches good philosophical ideals but he does not follow them himself in the class discussions he likes to cut people off before they can finish their sentence he has some interesting concepts though and teaches the class well there are only four graded papers composing of your grade in the class dislike
546,Panos  Alexakos,i love philosophy taking it with him was great respect him always go to class get the concepts read what he assigns and be able to write a decent essay be scared to ask questions or share what you think but he will tell you when you are wrong hahaha
547,Panos  Alexakos,panos is an excellent philosophy teacher who knows his stuff very well he is indeed hard and will tear you down if you dont know what your talking about but if you are respectful and attentive in his class you will do fine also study and read all information given to you and come to class regularly i got an a because i did all these things
548,Panos  Alexakos,dr alexakos will expect you to write a phd level paper in his class if you are cool with a b this wont be a problem if you want an a take someone who is actually willing to give them for undergraduate level work
549,Panos  Alexakos,this is not an easy class one should not expect to walk in and ace it you will never use a textbook in his class which is nice instead you use smalllarge books the class is a study of philosophical ideas and how they can be applied to morality in daily life your grade is mostly comprised of two papers and tests tests easy papers not
550,Panos  Alexakos,do not take this guy failing so had to withdraw should have looked on here before very hard class he is not clear whatsoever on what he says and it only gets harder do not take him
551,Panos  Alexakos,ethics not very ethical unable to make office hours had a mandatory attendance class at the same time despite this i did see panos a few times so he could review my essays i followed his recommendations exactly and still got a c win
552,Panos  Alexakos,if you like philosophy take this class the concepts are very hard but panos does very well at explaining them if you read the text listen in class and know each concept inside and out then you will do fine there are papers which are easy a good funny teacher though
553,Panos  Alexakos,i did not elect to seek panos in his office hours mainly because i had classes during all of his hours this hurt my grade significantly as he does not clearly outline the expectations on the papers during class time had i gone to hours i likely have had this issue
554,Jeffrey  Kent,really smart and a good teacher he gives a lot of extra credit for showing up to review sessions and open labs and will explain things you have problems with my favorite prof had so far
555,Jeffrey  Kent,professor kent is extremely smart and makes it clear he wants his students to succeed and understand the material he is teaching he gives you all the tools you need in order to pass his test he gives you so much material and lets you know exactly what is on the exam i would take him again
556,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is awesome his lecture and labs are the most difficult ever had but also the best i graduated the rad program years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run my advice worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he says and writes on the board if you what he wrote on the board fail
557,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious his tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed he has weekly review sessions to go over essay questions and even gives extra credit for attending them i would take him again do or do not there is no try you have to put forth the effort
558,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is a very helpful professor and is willing to help all the time his tests are hard but he gives you the material to do well on them he is very caring for his students and wants everyone to be successful i would take him again if i could work hard ask questions and go to review sessions and you will do great he is a great professor
559,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is brilliant and passionate about teaching he tells his students every day if you understand please stop me he truly desires student success but you have to put in your part
560,Jeffrey  Kent,great professor very intelligent and you will learn a lot if you put the time and effort into the class you will do well he is always willing to talk and help you out i would take his classes again
561,Jeffrey  Kent,i cannot understand how anyone can say that dr kent does not offer feedback he is always available after class and during office hours he will answer any questions you have but you have to ask expect him to know that you get something ask him tests are intense but he practically gives you the test in his reviews study them
562,Jeffrey  Kent,hands down the best teacher at vscc infinitely knowledgable and just read from slides he physically teaches on a chalk board extra credit is available on tests as long as you really put effort into studying the material sometimes it feels like moving too slow but all because he cares about student comprehension
563,Jeffrey  Kent,professor kent is hands down one of the best professors had my college career he gives a ton of extra credit and tells you exactly what he expects and what ask on his exams extremely knowledgeable and a great person in general a real gem he always comes to class with a smile and a hawaiian shirt on
564,Jeffrey  Kent,kent is a great bio prof for a and p i recommend him i learned so much a lot of memorizing but he gives you study guides out of class help and extra credit on exams show up and pay attention and you should get at least a c or better
565,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is flicking awesome most definitely not easy but easy and i am grateful to have had a professor that was so committed and knowledgeable since i have drawn greatly from what i learned in his class
566,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is one of the best teachers i have ever had he is very thorough and passionate about his work he is very approachable likeable and generally a nice guy he gives tons of extra credit on his exams but his exams are tough he gives a study guide and will tell you what essay questions will be on the exam you can pass with an a
567,Jeffrey  Kent,i love kent so yeah work but he is ultra nice and helpful you know exactly what essays you will have on tests so if you prepare those in advance that helps a ton the hardest thing is his tf on exams he loves teaching and always remembers name always study a couple hours every day and you should be good
568,Jeffrey  Kent,hardestsmartest professor ever met in my life he was even the coauthor of our textbook that many colleges use lol i only earned an a in his class because of his incredible teaching ability he will fill the entire board up multiple times per lecture but you better write every word of it down he never gets off topic and always helps you
569,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is my favorite teacher he is very thorough and tells you everything you need to know studying is a must for this class especially for the essay questions but he gives study guides that literally has everything on it you will need so helpful always made time if i understand something also gives amazing extra credit
570,Jeffrey  Kent,dr class is tough but his willingness to help makes a good grade possible however because he is so passionate about what he teaches he is extremely thorough as long as you mind putting in the hard work kent is a great teacher he truly cares about the success of his students i had him for l and taking him again for
571,Jeffrey  Kent,great professor will be taking him again
572,Jeffrey  Kent,dr kent is a very thorough professor he gives a ton of information and the tests can be difficult as long as you study the essay questions and notes an a is possible he gives a lot of extra credit on every test highly recommend
573,Jeffrey  Kent,this man is to smart for community college he needs to be at a university teaching students that already have a degree not first or second year students he offer much help and talks way above students level
574,Bill  Sanders,this class has nothing to do with the course description it is a web design class and i know why not being displayed as one sanders is a really nice guy but he know how to teach his tests are hard he know what doing in class and excepts you to know everything unless a mwd major take this class
575,Bill  Sanders,this is by far the worst professor i have ever had he does a horrible job at explaining things he lectures you when you do well on the exams he claims the class is easy all the time which not and he is so insulting the reviews for the exams and study guides are completely useless do not take this professor
576,Bill  Sanders,he is hard of hearing but very nice and understanding he easily gets off topic but is funny in his own way we learned php and and you kinda have to teach yourself
577,Bill  Sanders,he is hard of hearing but very nice and understanding he easily gets off topic but is funny in his own way the visual explanations book is hard to understand but you will be tested on it this is a web design class so be prepared to code and use dreamweaver
578,Bill  Sanders,ever choose this professor for any course i took him for a hunger class and he absolutely hated me for no reason very rude and arrogant he gave me a c in the class when i calculated my grade to be a this man is corrupt and bases grades on how well he likes you
579,Bill  Sanders,he is a horrible professor his website is as awful as he is URL design patterns are such stuff as dreams are made on is his catch phrase on his website that even grammatically make sense never mind the fact i have no idea what it means i know how he can criticize anyone website he is avoid
580,Bill  Sanders,he continuously asks you to redo projects and then drops your grade for handing them in late he spent most of the classes trying to figure out his own code rather then teaching us how to code things
581,Bill  Sanders,got off topic quite often lectured too much if you are already proficient in web design a very useless class visual explanations is absolutely above the general intelligence level many complained you will fail if you read for the exams projects are very easy if you know web design
582,Bill  Sanders,extremely unintelligent though wellintentioned the hunger class was a breeze if you read the books but expect to learn anything whatsoever from sanders he spends most of class time showing videos and telling personal anecdotes easily distracted and incapable of clearly answering simple questions easy a if all you care about
583,Bill  Sanders,very intelligent guy but has trouble teaching it to others he got off topic easily we used three books that seem to be above what students can comprehend students really have to think to connect what the books are saying to web design hated the tufte book exams are pretty easy if you have the slightest idea what talking about
584,Bill  Sanders,he is not a good professor he is very intelligent about the topic but cannot relate it well to the students he does not fully explain himself he puts code up and expects you to absorb it and be able to understand what it is all about the mwd department really needs to get another professor that can teach this subject
585,Bill  Sanders,very nice man though his ego was quite apparent rushed css too much
586,Bill  Sanders,awesome teacher
587,Bill  Sanders,really nice guy needs work on his teaching
588,Bill  Sanders,gets confused easily can be difficult because you know what he wants or will ask definitely has favorites gives a lot of projects along with almost deaf hard to ask questions in class
589,Bill  Sanders,aloof
590,Bill  Sanders,seems to get flustered on opening basic programs such as powerpoint
591,Bill  Sanders,dr sanders can be very vauge at times but his is the nicest guy in the world and if you want to get out of a test just keep asking him questions about anything with technology his sandlight productions website
592,Bill  Sanders,good guy tries hard but is about past his prime can be a useful professor but will take some patience
593,Bill  Sanders,this course was all over the place we used books on what seemed to be totally unrelated material his lectures make no sense whatsoever
594,Angelica  Vessella,she is an amazing instructor who has much knowledge
595,Angelica  Vessella,have taken many classes with gel highly recommended if you want to learn how to dance go to her
596,Angelica  Vessella,gel is really a great teacher knows the material backwards and forwards but has a way with personalizing the material as well she knows what like to be a student will certainly take more classes with her
597,Angelica  Vessella,such a great professor i took this class for extra credit very much enjoyed it such a great teacher really knows what shes talking about
598,Angelica  Vessella,great class great professor gel and the class itself is difficult but if you tough it out you will not only plass but develop useful skills as a dancer
599,Angelica  Vessella,if you do not like to be picked out in front of everyone do not take the class she has favorites and uses them to demonstrate and calls them out it can get very frustrating
600,Angelica  Vessella,wonderful professor certainly cares about her students and does anything she can to help them learn and grow as long as they are willing to put forth the effort this class will better you as a dancer and a performer and you will learn more than you anticipated sure you regret taking a class with gel great
601,Angelica  Vessella,very fun but challenging class if open minded by the end of the semester know how to tap gel is one of my favorite professors hard straight to the point and a great teacher
602,Angelica  Vessella,one of the best dance professors in ri the class was very fun but probably the most challenging if willing to learn she will help recommended professor
603,Angelica  Vessella,i loved taking choreography with her i learned more than i thought i would i was able to express myself every week with solos i got to make up the final was the best part you get to create a minute dance and perform it for an audience the class sometimes felt like therapy in a good way you have to journal on readings i am taking part
604,Angelica  Vessella,best teacher in the departmentperhaps the college you get out of her classes what you put in if you want to learn you will if you you attention to all levels in the class whether an advanced dancer or beginner do not expect and easy a expect to write and work hard.put in the effort and the class is very rewarding andfun
605,Angelica  Vessella,gel is a wonderful teacher she knows a lot about dance and the theater world and she is always telling stories about famous people she knows she may come across as mean at first but once you get to working with her she is actually very nice and a great teacher i recommend taking a dance class with her
606,Angelica  Vessella,i had her for intro tap she was a lot of fun to have as a teacher i have been tapping since i was little so i knew a lot already but she had a totally different way of tapping then what i was used to i found this experience a lot of fun and i am definitely looking forward to taking more classes with her
607,Angelica  Vessella,she is very rude if she feels comfortable with you she has no problem calling you out in front of the entire class making you look stupid unless you are one of her favorites she could care less about you or how she makes you feel you do get a good work out but not worth the humiliation or the frustration
608,Angelica  Vessella,not that good at all amateur hour
609,Angelica  Vessella,had her for intro int jazz.absolutely loved her been dancing my whole life and i know a good teacher when i have one takes time to correct you individually and answer any questions very encouraging as well caters to all levels as well some readings and short papers but very easy attendence and proper attitude is a must though
610,Angelica  Vessella,gel is very nice when coming to class make sure you dress appropriately she tries to make class fun and pushes you to do your best work out and stretches along with combinations of jazz a few handouts at first that you have to read and respond to but after that you just dance hard but worth good class you will definetly learn new things
611,Angelica  Vessella,gel is incredible you will learn life lessons as well as everything about dance other professors should take teaching lessons from her she is one in a million love you gel
612,Angelica  Vessella,love her you actually get a nice workout its great love you gel
613,Angelica  Vessella,what can i say loved her and the class
614,Ian  Gellatly,an ok prof lectures are dry but mandatory as he has weekly quizes that count for percent of your total mark midterms no final and exams are all written and very easy no need to buy the textbook even though he says you have to read the powerpoints and come to quiz days and you will get an a
615,Ian  Gellatly,amazing take him for he knows what he is doing gpa booster
616,Ian  Gellatly,lectures were extremely unclear the first midterm was a disaster no one knew what he was asking tries to be helpful but makes students uncomfortable instead he will interrupt you throughout your entire presentation making it very difficult to keep things flowing the content of the class is good but the instruction of it was very poor
617,Ian  Gellatly,big disappointment avoid this prof and class
618,Ian  Gellatly,ian is a weird guy and not a great instructor but easy enough to do well if you readmemorize the textbook and show up to class he loves to hear himself speak so hard to have meaningful conversations his marking is inconsistent and ambiguous at times he really lecture so you have to read and memorize the book to do well
619,Ian  Gellatly,gpa boosting show up to class do your best and youll get an a exams arent cumulative and the project was marked generously the students tend not to be as competitive or as smart as what would be found in accounting or finance classes since most just take it as an easy option class is not curved and relatively easy to get in the mid
620,Ian  Gellatly,excellent professor interesting practical class applicable to real life exams and assignments were straightforward and expectations were clear fair marker and good feedback some immature students whine and take it personally when they are critiqued on their subpar work and challenged to improve recommended with ian and would take again
621,Ian  Gellatly,he is willing to chat about the material and help you however half the time his answers make sense course has noncumulative midterms a group presentation and the take home final is two essays he can be frustrating and unclear but good lecture overall
622,Ian  Gellatly,not sure why ian gets such a bad rep he is not a super interesting prof but just show up to class and do other class work while there you need to pay attention if you read the textbook instead noncumulative midterms and a final project questions answered in essay form
623,Ian  Gellatly,worst class ever super easy non cumulative exams read the textbook the night before and be fine super boring and his lecture slides are just pages from the textbook that he wrote and he just reads them out loud but he takes attendance so you have to go to class and suffer through it know how to use ulearn either
624,Ian  Gellatly,he makes attendance mantory so if you want the participation you must go to every single class easy quizzes marking was unfair for midterm did not specify what he wanted but when he marked it was very specific the marks ranged from to take home final
625,Ian  Gellatly,i actually mind him as a teacher i felt i learned enough to get me through the rest of my smo classes the only thing is i feel his marking is sort of bipolar i need awesome on the midterm and project but then do well on the final which was take home even though i felt i answered the questions and he very helpful after
626,Ian  Gellatly,very easy quizzes and mc weekly quizzes short answer midterm take home final essay as long as you attend his lectures and pay attention you will do well he is unprofessional in presentations as he does tend to interrupt i didnt notice that adversely affecting my grade tho see him prior to presenting so u know what he expects
627,Ian  Gellatly,was very unprofessional during group presentations as he often always interrupts speakers in the middle of their presentation and would even answer his own questions in the end without waiting for class discussions quizzes and midterm are an easy even if just skimmed the chapters and read his slides beforehand
628,Ian  Gellatly,show up for class and read the chapters class is really general and the final is a take home essay easy a
629,Ian  Gellatly,this class is basically smo with a little more description into hr practices i hate this class with this professor because it provides generalized material with a teach who can not decide on a steadfast and concrete answer once you question his analysis he holds a grudge take with someone else
630,Ian  Gellatly,class was a total waste of time very little work and a group project where you can slack and a take home essay final like an english class doesnt show what you know but rather how well you can write waste of credits not applicable to real world practises to be fair hr is hard to teach in classroom
631,Ian  Gellatly,this guy is such a total joke this is my second degree and i have never seen such a useless lazy teacher he could never cut it in the real world so he has to teach avoid
632,Ian  Gellatly,easy class pretty interesting stuff
633,Karen  Carr,she a bad teacher but not someone i would recommend to anyone else she makes you read a lot of books which great but as long as you an english major be fine we were supposed to have five papers and we only did three and she cancelled class like four times
634,Karen  Carr,i had her for english and she was generally an okay teacher we mostly just talked about the book we had to read and most of the times we or she would go off on tangents not too many papers mostly just reading and class discussion
635,Karen  Carr,do not take.i switched into her class and not only is she a hardcore feminist that only gives women a chance she is a really tough grader she also care about her students again unless a woman passionate about feminism do not take her she will have you rolling your eyes as she complains about male privilege
636,Karen  Carr,a lot of reading which is to be expected class participation is key if you dont talk in cass you are screwed
637,Karen  Carr,good instructor hilarious and has a passion for english that most people have participate in the discussions come up with original ideas and be fine lots of reading it is a lit course and twopage papers due every week participation is a huge part of the grade introverts beware
638,Karen  Carr,first impressions are everything with this professor if you talk a lot get a great grade and really like you if you too bad for you you can be super smart and write awesome papers but if you talk no way getting an a
639,Karen  Carr,dr carr is one of those english teachers that you either love or you hate you will read a whole awful lot but the books are generally interesting classes are just one big discussion where basically no topic is offlimits as long as you can read and just talk a lot during class get a good grade
640,Karen  Carr,professor carr is one of the best professors i have had thus far she is extremely open minded and loves to hear your opinion regardless of her agreeing with it as for people complaining about the amount of books and reading you can get her books cheaply online and complain about reading when you are in a literature class that is silly
641,Karen  Carr,really great teacher friendly funny easy to talk to
642,Karen  Carr,this is my second time taking her class and she is a spectacular teacher her class is heavily dependent on assigned readings and class discussions but overall is rather chill as she is very openminded you have to buy a lot of books so expect to spend quite a bit of money if not much of a talker do expect your grade to suffer though
643,Karen  Carr,lots of books to buy for this class but they are all less then ten dollars sometimes less then or free cause some are on amazon if you are a person who does their work last minute all the time dont take the class she requires you to read chapters and discuss in class she has strict rules she will open your mind about the world big femenist
644,Karen  Carr,i am in this class now and was dreading taking eng.lit because i like to read the class is run as a discussion group and we are required to write a paragraph or two about what we read and bring one to each class she lets you know expected first class she is funny and makes class go by fast i would absolutely reccommend her
645,Karen  Carr,this professor is incredible people may hate her because she has you read some books you probably never would but its because she does that that she really expands your world and thinking if you enjoy reading and thinking outside the box take her a great first english class to take if your an english major especially
646,Karen  Carr,hmm not really sure how i felt about this teacher some days i liked her and others i she requires you to buy like books for her class and you go through one a week class is just a discussion on what you read if you like reading and talking out loud take this class however i did not say a single word and still passed with a c
647,Karen  Carr,final grade may be participation but speaking in class is really not required i spoke about times got on papers and got an a in the course i think as long as she recognizes that you are reading the texts and you are paying attention in class good in her book if you mind reading take her
648,Karen  Carr,awesome teacher all you gotta to do is talk in every class talk about the book make questions etc only thing is that there is alot of books to buy read maybe as long as you know how to talk
649,Karen  Carr,this class is complicated at best the class is seminar format with group discussions on every book she gives insane writing assignments that make no sense she is very nice but the papers should be used for a creative writing class not this overall though its an easy class of the grade is simply showing up the other is essaybased
650,Karen  Carr,awfull you have to buy a bunch of books and read them within a week about pages of reading for each class do not recommend at all also her grading system is horrible based on how much you talk in class but she doesnt let u kno how u are doing mid semester and very rude to students horrid experience
651,Karen  Carr,do not take she is the worst professor ever had at ric western lit is a required gen ed course and she gears it towards english majors very rude and does not care about the students at all requires you to buy about novels and you go through about one every week grading is based on her opinion of you awful
652,Karen  Carr,horrid experience not a fan of reading and we did a decent amount not the easiest grader participation is important but all that seems to happen is random rants completely offtopic pretty boring class
653,Wayne Charles  Hippo,pretty easy class this guy owns a lawfirm though so it is early in the morning i hate getting up early and i still managed to ace the class tests are and easy if you review your notes well he also curved all the tests in my class make sure you pay close attention cause he repeat himself oftern take this guy study all your notes
654,Wayne Charles  Hippo,a very good teacher and also a very nice guy everything in the class is helpful for real life test are easy just review ur notes
655,Sue  Davis,she is oldfashioned in her approach to teaching the subject matter she is definitely not a political scientist and is probably best suited for a different discipline altogether i found her courses to be poor preparation for graduate school
656,Sue  Davis,brutal workload based around unclear prompts led by unhelpful instruction the papers felt entirely unrelated to the course material i had to fight and scrape for my mediocre grade and i had one of the better grades in the class when half of your students are bombing it might not entirely be their fault
657,Sue  Davis,dr davis is nice enough but she is unbelievably hard was pretty interested in political science prior to taking her class but now will never take another one really tough papers with very vague prompts avoid her fys at all costs
658,Sue  Davis,great teacher very willing to help the students always available for questions definitely the hardest fys on campus but she managed to make it a great learning experience i feel much better about my own writing skills than i did before this course she can be intimidating but she is super nice
659,Sue  Davis,dr davis is super laidback and more than willing to work with students should they ask for help the reading material can get a little dry but i think dr davis does a great job of leading class discussions she is a great professor and mentor
660,Sue  Davis,if you want to become misinformed about the of the world take this professor the answer for everything is war and america in this class this is a class for narrow minded people
661,Sue  Davis,the reading for my class was out of control and she give very good feedback on papers so i feel like i got that much out of the class
662,Sue  Davis,this was a boring class it was tuesday and thursday at and all she did was show us powerpoint presentations that she had made a long time ago she told us where they needed updats but i still like it she was very nice and very helpfull esp for students needing extra time but she did not bring the subject matter alive for me read
663,Sue  Davis,she is a great teacher and i lover her in class but she is very tough on grading
664,Sue  Davis,interesting
665,Sue  Davis,one of the nicest laidback easy to approach professors at this school and tremendously tremendously smart
666,Sue  Davis,easily the smartest teacher at denidoo
667,Sue  Davis,the best professor i have had at denison
668,Melody  Ward,i loved her i have to agree with the person below me though she can be pretty rude at times class was a lot of fun
669,Melody  Ward,fun class can be a little rude at sometimes but i had fun your required to go to shows and your final is a group project or by urself class got me in shape i had fun
670,Melody  Ward,i had prof ward a few years ago she is really nice and very helpful it was the first college class i ever took and i feel fortunate to have had her
671,Melody  Ward,i love mrs ward she is an incredible teacher and extremely helpful i have her for intro to modern dance and a great class beileve it or not it even puts you in shape
672,Sharon  Teague,okay true this was a very demanding class she gives a lot work for you to complished in the semester i felt very overwhelmed sometimes but she is truly just trying to teach us a lot of material in one semester she is a very nice lady and keeps you on your toes in class im glad i took her but i am also glad that i never have to take her again
673,Sharon  Teague,teague sucks made me feel uncomfortable in every single class and there were days i wouldnt even go i couldnt put up with her forces you to participate treats u like a grader papers are grammer and citations not material study guides did not help at all very vague thinks all students have memorized every word from text avoid teague
674,Sharon  Teague,very hard grader especially on papers and she can be very sarcastic if you do the ids then you will do well on the tests
675,Sharon  Teague,definitely too much work for such a simple class she feels everyone is taking this class because tehy are interested in it not because its a requirement her study guides are pretty vague but somewhat useful.the papers are about grammer and citation not content the presentations also pose a problem since she gives no direction on them
676,Sharon  Teague,homework is mostly gave tests plus the final also papers and you could rewrite the first one and two presentations tests were not that hard she scaled both test the papers are the most difficult but not the worst class in the world i would really rewrite the first paper if you get a or lower worth it
677,Sharon  Teague,stay away oh my god she seems like a really nice person in real life but as a teacher she is the hardest i have ever experienced even harder than bio if anyone can imagine that she was extremely hard and asked questions on the exams that had nothing to do with the study guide that she gave us alot of memorizing get index cards
678,Sharon  Teague,teaguetreats students like third graders.she has managed to make everything technological assignments have to be sent via email using only ms word prior to bringing it to class making everything so difficult stressful and uncalled not that fond of the abundance of assignments either.sharon teauge is very hard to please
679,Sharon  Teague,i am graduating this year and out of every professor i had she was the absolute worst she uses kate turbain style on papers that she said i would experience all therough college and what a surprise turns out she was the only teacher who ever asked me to use it she is way too hard expects way to much out of you for a gen ed class
680,Sharon  Teague,prof teaugue is an excellant teacher in my opinion she loves the ancient times and is specialized in medieval wills the school changed the text book so she always sure of pages but is extremely helpful when you go to her with a question easy class if you do your and read
681,Sharon  Teague,no comments
682,Sharon  Teague,very challenging but i learned a lot definately a lot of work
683,Sharon  Teague,although she is challenging she is one of the better professors at ric tests are crazy hard and you have to be engaged in order to do well she is really intense about grammar and writing because she used to be a writing professor the papers are such a pain in the ass if you are looking for an easy ride slacker do not take her as a professor
684,Sharon  Teague,somewhat condescending but definitely one of the best teachers there it might seem like she assigns a lot of work but none of the work she assigns is ever busy work which is more than i can say for other professors do all the work and get a high b or an a easy
685,Sharon  Teague,no comments
686,Sharon  Teague,if you have her get out of it now before too late worst prof ever condescending not very bright grades papers horribly a gen ed and she acts like a grad course expects way too much not a fair grader and extremely annoying i just want to throw stuff at her when she talks and yeah concerned more with grammar
687,Sharon  Teague,she is such a flake and a complete airhead she is aggervating annoying dont take her class you will want to hurt her before over
688,Sharon  Teague,take teague especially at and it being your first college class ever she seriously must thing that her class is the only one we have because she piles on the homework
689,Sharon  Teague,hated her she condecending and had no clue what was going on she made me not want to go to class and that has never happened before when it comes time for her papers she gives you the materials that she wants you to use which yes was convient but did not show if you actually understood the topic she mostely grades the papers in grammer
690,Sharon  Teague,i agree she is a wack job when i had her she made us have study buddies and thats what we had to do for the beginning of every class we got in trouble is we werent studying however her grading is very easy as long as you follow intrusctions
691,Sharon  Teague,she sucks totally stupid jumps around and never gets to the point may and she still has no idea that no one cares about her or her class she spends the entire class babbling about things that are completly unrelated to history and she thinks we actually care about her class
692,Carol  McClure,admit i did learn a lot in this class but it was one of the hardest classes ever taken you have to study for all the tests or no way pass pretty much everything on the test is essay questions and she grades hard but if dedicated and take the time to study do good
693,Carol  McClure,very difficult teacher people are right you do need all the time in the world to pass this class i care if a genius her tests are very difficult find another professor trust me
694,Carol  McClure,yes if lazy definitely not the class for you even if not lazy honestly to be truly honest i would recommend finding another professor her lectures are very unenthusiastic and her tests are pretty hard like from a scale from definitely at least an
695,Carol  McClure,this is mos def not an easy a you really have to work your butt off i dont recommend her unless you have all the time in the world to study
696,Carol  McClure,try to take bio with another professor
697,Carol  McClure,no comments
698,Carol  McClure,easily the hardest class ever taken lectures insanely boring take really good notes her tests are the hardest ever taken and an honors student the tests are mostly essays essays in biology take someone else if you can if you have to take her show up every day and get the book you will need it study as much as you can
699,Carol  McClure,no comments
700,Carol  McClure,she definately makes you work for your grade she is a good professor that knows her stuff but man she expects you to know a lot sometimes when you get things she looks at you like your stupid but then she try to explain it so you would understand i would take her if you know a lot about biology
701,Carol  McClure,take her seriously i thought everyone was just lazy and want do their work but she is not worth taking she is so unclear and all of the tests are written no scantrons she treats the class like a major class yes i did pass but with this system avoid her
702,Carol  McClure,she is very confusing and somewhat hard the book clarifies a lot at least for me it did bio is a pretty interseting subject but she makes it boring nice and does offer extra credit
703,Carol  McClure,ok if you are a lazy arse dont take this class but easy if you try and go to class do not need to open your book just reveiw all notes for the test and follow the study guide if asking for too much take the class i learned a lot
704,Carol  McClure,prof has very difficult exams memorize all of your notes and the book be sure to be in class every day because extra credit will sure help your grade try to take bio with another professor if you can
705,Carol  McClure,you have to go to class or else you do well her lecture notes are all the tests just copy those and do fine she grades hard on the papers but offers extra credit i learned a lot from her
706,Carol  McClure,be lazy with your reading up and your almost garuanteed an a do what she says and memorize her lecture topics and the rest is downhill you pussies
707,Carol  McClure,she really was a good teacher it was a fun class but watch out cuz its a lot of work if you study exactly what she teaches you wont even need the book and you will do fine but a lot of
708,Carol  McClure,the class that bad if you work hard and study a lot get an a i had never learned so much before from any other science class she will help you out if needed and the cd from the book helps a lot
709,Carol  McClure,a nice lady but make biology harder than it really is you have to read the book and study her notes to get a decent grade in the class go to her study session write down everything she says cuz its maybe on the test
710,Carol  McClure,she is crazy this class is super hard you have to be very serious about biology and read a lot i dont recomend her she makes no sense she should retire shes too old
711,Carol  McClure,this class is extremely hard and boring she can be a nice woman and if you really really pay attention which is hard to do with her you may pass the tests consist mostly of essays basically dont take her if you want a decent grade
712,Vincent  Sherry,no comments
713,Vincent  Sherry,if you are a serious english student you will love dr sherry i watched a football player become a lover of yeats dr voice is the way poetry should sound
714,Charles  Cherry,professor cherry was a great professor although he was hard of hearing he consistently did his best to get everyone involved in class it is unfortunate that he is retiring to become a surf instructor in california as he will be missed by the entire villanova community
715,Charles  Cherry,great solid professor people complain about the electronic journals but all he is asking you to do is write a response to a specific question he asks about the reading in sentences there are only electronic journals and two page papers in this class so its a breeze dr cherry is super knowledge and has tons of experience
716,Charles  Cherry,a paragraph was due weekly grades were unclear until the end he looks for very small details in all of the stories read close reading is necessary
717,Charles  Cherry,dr cherry is a great professor a discussion based classed with a relaxed atmosphere where people can share their ideas about the text you need to read in order to do well but he chooses good texts for the class he has a great sense of humor and is clear about what he expects you to accomplish in your papers i recommend taking his class
718,Charles  Cherry,he will not look over any rough drafts for papers you may have the electronic journals are the biggest nuisances you will ever get his tests are very random and rely on very small facts from the books you have read do not be late do show up to every class do your electronic journals and you should be fine
719,Charles  Cherry,awesome sense of humor and likes south park very helpful but expects you to know how to write already from h.s teaches you to write better fun discussions and he knows his stuff teach lots of classes which is a shame when he calls on you say something participation essays electronic journals exams
720,Charles  Cherry,definitely a good teacher
721,Charles  Cherry,i had dr cherry for american short story unfortunately he teach much since head of the dept very unfortunate an excellent teacher and i would love to take another of his classes
722,Ionna  Ghenciu,i had him as a permasub the last month of class he saved the class from a bad teacher he went back and retaught everything making sure we knew the material accent that bad talks about math on a personal level instead of math terms if the grade on your final is better than your overall he gives you that grade nice guy approachable
723,Ionna  Ghenciu,not a good teacher
724,Ionna  Ghenciu,has a wicked accent and wierd hand witing but he knows the stuff teaching
725,Ionna  Ghenciu,accent hard to understand
726,Ionna  Ghenciu,he was a great teacher i am horrible in math and i made an a in his class the tests are exactly the same as the review get him if you can
727,Ionna  Ghenciu,easy reviews cover quizes and exams exactly
728,Joann  Hilton,i stand her as a teacher that said her class helped me become a better writer that helped me in college as well as my career i owe her a big thank you
729,Joann  Hilton,professor hilton was wonderful she really made her assignments clear and her papers and novels were always very interesting and fun to read
730,Joann  Hilton,pro hilton was so interesting in her lectures when i transfered my english teacher was lame compaired to her however she is very specific on papers so take advantage of having her look over it and going to the writing lab she is very
731,Joann  Hilton,prof hilton was awesome though her essay themes could be challenging they were fun and she was a fair grader it was always very obvious that she loved her subject loved to teach it and knew her stuff
732,Joann  Hilton,i really liked her as a teacher but a lot of the people in my class thought she was a tough grader i did well in her class i got an a i think she grades easier if she likes you
733,Paul  Grobstein,paul was amazing he was so helpful in and out of class i learned so much in his class because we talked about everything i wish i could thank him for everything he did for me
734,Paul  Grobstein,professor grobstein was an incredibly engaging and downright lovely professor i am very grateful to have had the opportunity to share stories with him he will be greatly missed rebekah
735,Paul  Grobstein,this is not a traditional science class by any means in fact a great class for non sciencey people who need a science credit but it is definitely element other people complain about his philosophizing but that is exactly what this class is about so it was perfect fun interesting class
736,Paul  Grobstein,paul is an amazing professor he was able to take very complex principles and fully explain them to the class i left the class with more than i would have every hoped for he teaches science with a philosophy twist and although i started the class completely perplexed by the natural sciences i now feel passion for them great experience
737,Paul  Grobstein,he is great for none science majors who want to learn some science but if you are a science major i would suggest you find a different professor he spends the whole class talking about his idea of science but he actually teach it when he does he dumbs it down to an insulting level
738,Paul  Grobstein,no comments
739,Paul  Grobstein,i know what people are talking about prof grobstein is one of the best professors ever had in my life if you really want to learn something take his class he really makes you think critically about issues instead of taking them at face value how many teachers make you do that
740,Paul  Grobstein,he was wonderful my favorite teacher thus far
741,Paul  Grobstein,this guy can talk his butt off half the time i think philosophy class instead hardly any use of any text all discussions which i guess is good for a liberal arts school to a point but out of hand
742,Paul  Grobstein,paul needs to teach the science before he can philosophize about the principles of science frankly you are wasting money by taking this class
743,Paul  Grobstein,no comments
744,Paul  Grobstein,no comments
745,Paul  Grobstein,awful
746,Paul  Grobstein,no comments
747,Paul  Grobstein,this professor is awesome so helpful and really interested in helping students learn he encourages discussion inside and outside the classroom and he teahes you how to look at subjects from a new angle
748,Penny  Foster,one of the worst professors ever had she tells you to follow the directions carefully but the directions could not be more unclear she initially introduced herself as the head of the computer and technology department at aacc but there is absolutely no way true if it is shame on you aacc she know anything about computers
749,Penny  Foster,terrible communicator she does not respond to emails and when she is short almost annoyed you even asked she does not do any grading at all the computer does all the grading and she does not check over to see even if that is correct we were given extra credit assignments and she did not even include them in the final grade terrible
750,Penny  Foster,one of the worst professors i ever had she does not respond to emails which is not good for a professor communication is a plus she is all into herself in class she does nothing but play on her little computer she is good at telling you what she want to do when she retire good at telling students not to ask her questions ask a group member
751,Penny  Foster,course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late uninterested in helping students in anyway horrible at clarifying what needs to be done if you take her course you will regret it
752,Penny  Foster,teacher was extremely unhelpful awful at grading assignments and all the quizzes were poorly done if you can help it do not take this teacher it will almost be next to impossible to get an a
753,Penny  Foster,i would recommend this teacher to no one ever takes a month to grade assignments she takes two weeks to respond to emails then be to late because the assignments due date has passed and nothing she will do you just have to take the loss you never get a straight answer the class itself is fine but the teacher is not for you
754,Penny  Foster,awesome class i took it online and learned a lot she grades fast and is very fair she accept late work so if you are for that pick another professor as long as you do what is expected and try hard you will do well i loved this class and i found professor foster to be super fair what you learn you will utilize in everyday life
755,Penny  Foster,i took this class online i loved the program it was in snap i knew exactly what was expected of me every week i do not like the fact that the weeks are locked until current sometimes i want to work ahead and cannot she is totally responsive and very encouraging she grades fast and is fair i recommend this class for sure
756,Penny  Foster,keep looking not helpful and a terrible teacher she is not flexible at all even if you want to work ahead for one week i took her online course and i do not recommend it to even an enemy
757,Penny  Foster,only take her class if you have to if you can get a different teacher you should i took her online computer class and she constantly changed the times things were due and closed drop boxes and earlier than the time she said they would be closed on the syllabus she overly helpful with anything
758,Penny  Foster,she can be tough but fair as long as you do your assignments be fine
759,Penny  Foster,very outgoing and makes her classes fun and interesting wants all her students to do well
760,Penny  Foster,would not recommend her she takes way to long to respond to questions online course and takes even longer to grade assignments i learned nothing from her she is a course administrator not a teacher also not flexible with anything i would keep looking if you want a teacher
761,Penny  Foster,she is very understanding and helpful i would reccomend her to anyone
762,Penny  Foster,taking her help desk concepts class online and i love it so easy and the assignments are easy to understand very quick to respond to questions
763,Penny  Foster,she doesnt like getting up early thats for sure but ive never met anyone with as much energy as her in the morning hilarious teacher a must have for your morning wake up computer class
764,Penny  Foster,professor foster was awesome nice very friendly full of energy not all that hard of a class i really learned alot though
765,Penny  Foster,i liked her easy class nice professor
766,Penny  Foster,excellent teacher very good personality she like getting up early and i had her at am she let us come to the am final and hour late and gave us a short final
767,Dennis  Crockett,the most hilarious professor ever had and retiring soon trust me no matter what your major is you will not regret taking one of his classes
768,Dennis  Crockett,freaking love this guy i think his f bomb record is a class takes nothing seriously but really really knows his stuff his goals are to make us laugh and help us view the world around us with a healthy dose of humor probably one of my fave people on the planet
769,Dennis  Crockett,outlook is all his own and he particularly works from a cynical critical and contextual point of view not only is he extremely knowledgable and insightful but he is also hilarious and entertaining he is the best professor i have ever had and being his student was a pleasure and an honor
770,Dennis  Crockett,dennis is by far the best teacher ever had hilarious and brilliant he is also an incredible person and anyone who gets to know him is very lucky his classes are incredibletake one
771,Dennis  Crockett,my favorite professor i recommend him without reservations
772,Dennis  Crockett,dennis is the man of the many teachers and professors had in my student career i have my now he is the best professor i have ever had
773,Dennis  Crockett,dennis has incredible knowledge about his subject and makes the classes laughoutloud entertaining and memorable he also holds his students to a very high standard but is always approachable and helpful he has remained a dear friend to this day long after i graduated from whitman
774,Dennis  Crockett,dennis is a great prof he teaches you other things about art history besides the common knowledge he makes it fun but also very challenging you feel a real sense of accomplishment when you do well in his classes
775,Thomas  Boyle,the easiest guy you could have found in the whole brooklyn college english department for this course i was lucky to have found him we read couple of stories wrote two papers and one final paper for the semester and the entire class got an a thats amazing and kool he is not teaching any more but we need professors like him
776,Thomas  Boyle,i think he might have retired by now but i had him for my spring eng class he made us buy this expensive book we used only for a while during the semester he made us write only three stories and a final paper and there it was we all got an a for his class not the best but not the worst either
777,Thomas  Boyle,ok i thought he was lazy had us write a bunch of papers not give back but if you do the work and attend class be ok as i am sure i am getting my a i think he is retiring after this spring semester
778,Thomas  Boyle,worst memory i ve ever had in college
779,Thomas  Boyle,cool teacher easy class and hardly any work i had him once a week for a night class we never stayed the hours usually held us for hrs went through the readings with us in class so we knew what the material was only knock on him is hes a tough grader midterm final paper
780,Thomas  Boyle,good professor not a lot of assignments and is flexible with deadlines do the assignments and youll get a good grade
781,Thomas  Boyle,no comments
782,Thomas  Boyle,class was okay not very stimulating.i feel very interested and motivated to write and held off on the first assignment till the very last moment.i was sure that my grade was doomed already.however once i wrote more pieces and class was overhe gave me an a.so as long as you do the work and have great grammar there be a problem
783,Thomas  Boyle,teaches little reads alot and goes on tangents he is tough on grading if he likes you aka your attractive and is in his face alot and he learns your name you should do well in his class
784,Thomas  Boyle,unfelpful are you crazy well if u want to sit back and not to do a thing then yes he help prof boyle knows his subject very well encourages u to write better than average undegrad student and he does a good job helping u to get to that level only those who are lazy can say such a thing about their bellybutton lint
785,Thomas  Boyle,i think this professor is great he knows a ton about the subject and arrogant he is helpful with writing problems and encourages students i highly reccomend him
786,Thomas  Boyle,all i can say is what an guy thinks that all his students should write like the writers for the the average grade in our class was a b and there was only two the guy has the personality of a box and is probably the most unfair grader in this college unhelpful.you will learn more by staring at your bellybutton lint
787,Thomas  Boyle,he was a very easygoing professor and very fair he was always willing to work with the students especially if they doing well if you show up to class and you have decent writing ability be fine if you write avoid the class he was also very clear about what he would ask on his exams if you do the work get an a
788,Thomas  Boyle,had a great time in his class seems to take students ideas very seriously sometimes more seriously than his own but he wont let bad writing or ideas slide good sense of humor and always manages to bring a personal understanding to the text
789,Thomas  Boyle,no comments
790,Thomas  Boyle,no comments
791,Thomas  Boyle,smart and funny it sounds like his undergraduates like him but we have a pretty good time in the grad class legitimately care about your interpretation and make you think
792,Thomas  Boyle,boring class boring reading material
793,Thomas  Boyle,very easy going but completely resistant to the and spin which is why some people have a problem with him
794,Thomas  Boyle,very unfair grader and very aloof class was a joke but he grade that way definitely look for a better professor
795,Kurt  Panter,he is a very immature guy he believes he is always right even when he is not had to schedule with him but believes it is my fault even though i gave him at least two weeks notice he treats students as kids and not as adults
796,Kurt  Panter,he always went over the scheduled end time if you have word for word answers on the exam you would not receive full credit the subject was boring to begin with and he made the class even more boring not very professional only plus he never made you do busy work everything had a purpose
797,Kurt  Panter,hard grader uninteresting lectures
798,Kurt  Panter,kurt is a great guy most labs will be in the optics room and will take some time to complete best not to procrastinate in case you have questions he has office hours but welcomes walkins book is a must and you have to have high discipline hard grader but he is just giving an honest rating of how much you really understand
799,Kurt  Panter,hard test grader but he wants you to know as much as possible
800,Kurt  Panter,kurt is a very boring lecturer he does a lot of talking about advanced geology and his research but forgets that this is an introductory geology and we really know all that much about it he likes to put up pictures and explain them in complex details before we even understand the words he says
801,Kurt  Panter,as a person a lot of fun but pretty hard grader lectures are boring and not quite consistent exams seem to be super difficult but even if you gave a correct answer to question you still can get much less points than expected would not recommend this
802,Kurt  Panter,his class is difficult but as long as you study and go to class really not that bad the lab ta is very helpful too panter cares about the class and really enjoys talking about rocks he is easy to understand i hated the class boring rocks are not my thing but definably doable as long as you give it a chance and study
803,Kurt  Panter,this is one of the worst classes i have ever taken his tests are ridiculously difficult my grad student for my lab was foreign and was incomprehensible and understand half of the questions we asked he asserted that over half the class failed the first exam bc we study enough run away
804,Kurt  Panter,run away
805,Kurt  Panter,dr panter is great very smart super nice tough class but worth it because an awesome prof
806,Kurt  Panter,run away
807,Kurt  Panter,kurt seems like a real nice guy class can be boring you have to prepare for the tests if you want a good grade offers extra credit each week does not take attendance so if you miss a class no big deal overall class

817,Itzhak  Kerstein,i took all three of his classes they are pretty difficult however he is very helpful and will even help you with the questions during the test sometimes gives answers i would recomend him to anyone
818,Itzhak  Kerstein,does not curve and he makes you study and know all the voc aks que every lesson also you will learn hebrew but a lot of work not easy but fair
819,Itzhak  Kerstein,he is a very nice professor and a nice person he is fair he really makes you learn i did not know hebrew at all and now i can speak understand a little read and write it is not easy at all but if you want to learn he is there for you if you ask questions on the tests he gives you answers
820,Itzhak  Kerstein,if you know a little hebrew than you wont have a problam if you dont know anything its not terribly hard but youll have to work overall he is a very nice guy you have no choice if you take hebrew because hes the only teacher which is not such a bad thing
821,Itzhak  Kerstein,very nice and helpful easy class for someone who knows a little hebrew
822,Itzhak  Kerstein,no choice if you want hebrew he is the only hebrew language professor anything you know on the tests just ask he will tell you straight out one time i asked an answer straight he told me the answer the before and the after without my asking

827,Alvin  Snadowsky,you go wrong with this professor he has a genuine interest in helping you learn the material and is flexible
828,Alvin  Snadowsky,he is very nice his class was fun also his tone is a lil monotone but all in all a great professor
829,Alvin  Snadowsky,very humble but very funny and full of wit he is very knowledgeable and wants everyone to do well and actually learn he is highly recommended
830,Alvin  Snadowsky,alvin is incredible please take him anytime you can
831,Alvin  Snadowsky,he was mumbling something for several classes and then students were doing the presentations did not teach anything in class but the final was hard and from the book
832,Alvin  Snadowsky,i had him for small groups what a great guy but boy is he boring as i know what he means well but you just want to pull the words out of his mouth it take him so long to say them i got an a he only gives a final and two easy papers
833,Alvin  Snadowsky,the class is fun but lately he has decided to give a final pay attention because this is very important the final is serious read the book or at least the chapters that he tells you to if you want a good grade you need to do well on the final i was running an a in teh class and after the final ended witha
834,Alvin  Snadowsky,professor snadowsky is a wonderful professor with many years of expierence he makes the class fun by getting everyone involved in the learning process i love him and i too wish he taught more courses he wants everyone to do well but take my word for it register for the class
835,Alvin  Snadowsky,do not take the final exam lightly for you really have to read the book
836,Alvin  Snadowsky,a sweetheart and great professor i wish he taught more classes for register for them all definitely take this class for its a fun and memorable experience no tests papers basically about yourself it should be considered an education course as well as a psych for you have to basically do a lesson plan and teach the class
837,Alvin  Snadowsky,easy class but boring
838,Alvin  Snadowsky,i adore him he is the nicest sweetest old man alive his class is great all the presentations so far are interesting and fun like everyone else says an easy and enjoyable class lots of chocolate and arts and crafts involved
839,Alvin  Snadowsky,class is fun we played games the whole time super easy a but when he talks he is so boring almost unbearable i got an a but i feel like i learned anything nice old guy
840,Alvin  Snadowsky,nicest sweetest man to all students
841,Alvin  Snadowsky,the easiest teacher you will ever have.everything that he repeats times is a test question.you have to do an oral report which sucks.but ooverall an easy a.you can be braindead and pass
842,Alvin  Snadowsky,this professor is the best he wnat you to pass witha good grade just seeing his enthusiam at his age makes you smile he loves what he does not a difficult class easy a you eat alot of candy in this class discussions are really meaningful
843,Alvin  Snadowsky,the best professor i have ever taken he is funny knows his subject if you want to get a nice grade you have to take him if you get a chance he is the best
844,Alvin  Snadowsky,this professor is great this class only involves teaching the class for a day and writing two papers very easy and fun just watching him teach makes you smile you will have a blast
845,Alvin  Snadowsky,too easy just copy his notes word for word as he repeats each sentence like times as if he gives you the exams mostly straight out of these notes that he uses every semester a short presentation along with a page paper easy a
846,Ian  McMahan,laziest professor i have ever met attendance not mandatory just have to read the book his book and the whole thing front to back he tells you what he says in class is not important because its in the book read know the terms and give you everyone the same grade a
847,Ian  McMahan,nice guy but boring notes are useless just read the textbook or the summary at the end of the chapter if your lazy like me tests are onfusing but gives a nice curve when i seen i got a a i was really happy.gives you an optional paper but its long and woud of been a waste of time for me
848,Ian  McMahan,ok so attendence not manditory notes not worth much def mostly all about the txt book tests and optional paper tests with long questions and are confusing after the test u see what expect but def confusing nice guy but so boring goes on tangents i got a im content cause his tests were confusing read the txtbook good luck
849,Ian  McMahan,he is the nicest old guy he really isbut i got a b in the classmy lowest grade his quizzes are the trickiest things in the worldnotes r completely uselesshe expects u to memorize everythingg in the chapter n will pull out random stuff that never expect to see the final was unbelievably hard nice guy but up to you honestly
850,Ian  McMahan,this guy didnt even bother showing up to the final exam that shows how much he really cares about what happens on his final he may have been good but its time to retire rather then pretend to be teaching tricky questions on the final exam is not enjoyable not showing up for the final cause of little rain is pathetic avoid him
851,Ian  McMahan,most boring class i ever had i never thought possible to fall asleep while making notes and notes are not so helpfull you better read al chapters twice with be more or less fine questions are very tricky try to avoid this class
852,Ian  McMahan,dont even bother going to class everything is in the book gives quizes and drops the lowest read the chapters instead of going to class and youll get an a
853,Ian  McMahan,excellent professor everything is straight from the book and you need not attend the classes the class time gives excellent insight into understanding what is going on and if you choose not to go your loss very easy exams
854,Ian  McMahan,the problem with bc students is that they study mcmahan is great he give surprises on exams as other professors do attend lecture read the text read to understand not memorize and be fine we do read the entire book but as long as you keep up there be any problems i highly recommend him
855,Ian  McMahan,hard to understand his lecture exam are from book and his lecture speech but you need to attend everyday and writes down everything to know what is on his exam his lecture sometime confused you
856,Ian  McMahan,interesting subject matter but very boring delivery his exams are fair straight from the text he curves grades and gives you the opportunity for extra credit work to boost your grade if you read the text you can do well
857,Ian  McMahan,very boring pretty easy grader though quizzes straight from book lectures straight from book get a good hour or so nap in his class
858,Ian  McMahan,excellent prof explains everything extremely well knows how to relate simple examples to complicated topics gives easy tests and no hws as long as you read and take class notes you have nothing to worry about highly recommend this teacher
859,Ian  McMahan,a good prof.u have to go to class but just read thru the books for all quizes and do the online practice.lectures are very helpful for exams if you take notes.he care about the attendence no homework for his one optional term a fair base on exa
860,Ian  McMahan,if you do the reading you will do fine on his quiz
861,Ian  McMahan,gives u quizes drops one u dont have to come to class to learn the material everything is straight out of the book not such a hard class
862,Ian  McMahan,confuses everything although information is directly from the book drops lowest quiz but they carry heavy weight in terms of your final grade
863,Ian  McMahan,great teacher easy class usefull info rock on mcmahan
864,Ian  McMahan,great professor info was clear in order and insightful very easy to learn from gives several difficult multiplechoice quizes and drops lowest so you get several chances instead of everything riding on midterm and final really nice guy
865,Ian  McMahan,crazy man
866,Charles  Green,the hardest easy a you will ever get sitting through this class is absolute torture i do not understand how someone who does so little can still be a professor do not take his class the a is not worth it.2
867,Charles  Green,if looking for an a this was an easy class but also because we had almost no assignments there were times he show up material was irrelevant a nice dude and clearly smart but he care about undergrads and taught us literally nothing if you actually want to know urban soc do not take the class with him
868,Charles  Green,i was very uneasy as to how grading will be and i cannot lie waiting for my grade made me very anxious as a professor def not the best as an advisor he is phenomenal and keeps things real unless ready to be fully engaged i would avoid taking him but he is great to talk to
869,Charles  Green,you will be lost the entire semester he is a nice guy but is not clear about anything we know about our final exam until the week before there is not a lot of work for the class no textbook but this class was a headache he was not helpful at all no syllabus nothing
870,Charles  Green,no just no he should not be a professor he is so clueless to everything that is going around his lectures are boring and has nothing to do with the class okay its called race and ethnicity but we only focused on black people this class was tortuous
871,Charles  Green,this guy has no idea going on half the time he know what day it is he accidentally gave our midterm to the wrong class his lectures are pointless and you will learn nothing would not take again
872,Charles  Green,i would rather die a slow and painful death than ever take any class taught by this guy ever again
873,Charles  Green,jumps around in lessons the point at the end of it is unknown has a syllabus but no order to it has difficulties with real review for exams just read the book and memorize all the theories we had to use two books one was a textbook on terms other on examples would have liked to use book more
874,Charles  Green,boring there is little structure to the class and he always stick to the syllabus the midterm is relatively easy there are a couple of debates and papers but i get much out of the class you pretty much teach yourself with the information from the book hard to understand the points he wants to make
875,Charles  Green,boring class never knew what he was talking about most of the time the book is not a must he is good at teaching he would be better if he gave some sort of outline for what he was teaching
876,Charles  Green,can be interesting if you enjoy the topics the lectures can be long and boring the class itself seems easy but beware he is a tough grader thought i did well for the class but ended up with less
877,Charles  Green,great professor great knowledge of subject highly recommend this class very little use of text lots of articles to read on line can be a little vague as to what he wants from students midterm final and group project
878,Charles  Green,very very very nice man very boring being so laid back didnt help much if yu arent interested it gets boring tests um theyre ok i didnt open a book never paid attention in class and passed with a b.idk if i wuld recommend but hes very nice and is willing to help
879,Charles  Green,prof green has a lot of information to share you have to be self motivated in his class because he is very laid back but grades hard still i think he is a good professor for those interested in the field i am definitely taking other classes he offers
880,Charles  Green,you will not learn anything from this teacher he can not clearly explain a concept or stay on track with a thought he can not engage the class and he will tell you to prepare for exams in one form and then change it without explaining his test are not fair and will ask questions which are opinion based then mark it wrong
881,Charles  Green,he is a wonderful and very intelligent man he knows the subject very well some people do tend to get lost though because of the way he explains things he might be too smart
882,Charles  Green,it was my favorite subject i never skipped a single class read notes and textbook did my assignments and always visited his office the only patterned grade i got throughout the semester was if i do all of the above i wonder if i would end up with anything higher sometimes hard to understand what exactly he wants from you
883,Charles  Green,i had him last year he my favorite for sure i find his class boring he was mostly absent.in his class i was confused to want he talking about although i did read the book.for me he lack a lot to be a professor but my opinion
884,Charles  Green,i became addicted to this class subjects of discussions are very interesting a few written assignments most of the grade depends on your performance on the midterm and final about each and two essays he is very nice toward his students and will take in consideration your effort and dedication to his class so your final grade raises
885,Charles  Green,i have never thought of sociology as of subject of my interest since i started attending his class it seemed that this semester flew in one second bottom line class is awesome written assignments hard at all rather intriguing and challenging in a positive way it is not likely that you regret if you take it
886,Matthew  Erdelyi,had him for intro to personality his lectures are unclear he goes off topic a lot it was hard to grasp much in his class superr boring he also makes you buy his his own books which is for both decent guy bad prof
887,Matthew  Erdelyi,had some terrible teachers but he definitely made it to the top of the list i learned anything about the actual course but can tell you anything there is to know about his personal life and family do not take i repeat do not take unless you want to have a terrible semester
888,Matthew  Erdelyi,he teach the first times i was there i realized that he only talks about his life and it then the other times i was there was to find out when we will take the exam uh well we were very behind so he gave everyone a on the second exam dropping the lowest grade of the two easy a but you learn a thing just stay away
889,Matthew  Erdelyi,want a ancient professor whose lectures coherent and so boring they make you want to rip your eyes out then this hungarian psychologist called erdelyi is your guy you learn squat in his class he take attendance he gives midterms and a final other than that a really nice guy probably suffering from amnesia
890,Matthew  Erdelyi,i took him my first semester and all i remember is that he has an asian wife who he spoke of most of the time and joked that its good that he has tenure i gave him a for difficulty bc i was totally unprepared for the tests because he teach he even yelled at me once because i asked to many questions actually yelled bc i showed interest
891,Matthew  Erdelyi,do not take him he does not speak about psychology of personality he speaks mostly on statistics but what does stats have to do with this class he keeps on repeating what he says and stays on one chapter almost for a month his textbook does not make sense as well terrible professor
892,Matthew  Erdelyi,not even weeks into school and dropping this course this is the only time i have ever needed to drop a course mid semester he is an absolute idiot never stays on topic and repeats everything times over do not take him you will regret it he needs to be fired stat
893,Matthew  Erdelyi,he likes to go on and on about his whole lifestory do not expect him to stay on topic most of the things you learn in this class will be from the textbook not from him he only took attendance times so a lot of people skipped many of his classes and just did the readings but he assign any papers or homework other than that nice
894,Matthew  Erdelyi,a very nice and lenient professor he does tend to go off topic during lectures unfortunately we get to finish all the chapts and topics during my fall semester honestly i just think getting old but not a bad professor although he only took attendance sometimes best to show up to know what will be on tests no hw
895,Matthew  Erdelyi,a junior and a i took him during my first semester at bc his class is still the only class in my life that gotten a c in his exams have nothing to do with the textbook and his lectures are not coherent writing this review because i want to make sure other students make the same mistake i did take him
896,Matthew  Erdelyi,very unclear long rambling lectures very selfcentered man lectures were about himself and about the material test questions had some surprises content that you can be sure was never covered in class he is sadly nearly tenured
897,Matthew  Erdelyi,prof class was horrible not only did i get nothing out of his class but it was the first class i got a c in always received a b or an a in a psyc class he gets off topic in a heartbeat so you end up lost hes so disorganized some people should not be allowed to teach please do not take him or regret it as i have now
898,Matthew  Erdelyi,if you have barely any interest in the subject of psychology i fully recommend taking his class for you will pass he took most of the time in class to talk about his personal life barley uses the textbook two tests plus a final drops the lowest grade he was so behind on teaching us that he gave every student a for the second exam
899,Matthew  Erdelyi,run away fast take this class
900,Matthew  Erdelyi,eaasy grade just show up didnt need to pay attention half of the time never used the textbook and still passed only tests lowest score is dropped very much a story telling teacher mostly about his personal life and random things going on in class
901,Matthew  Erdelyi,do not take
902,Matthew  Erdelyi,all over the place you leave most classes feeling like you learn anything at all since attendance mandatory it makes you not want to waste your time and stay home nice though so not a tough grader
903,Matthew  Erdelyi,needs to stick to specific topic more
904,Matthew  Erdelyi,needs to stick to topic more
905,Matthew  Erdelyi,really confusing and slow often goes on random or semirandom tangents the class progresses really slowly as he randomly comments on students who say something walk in late or are just sitting minding their own business like to emphasize the slowness november and our test was this past monday no assignments though
906,Harihar  Khanal,dr khanal knows what talking about but he always the clearest about expressing that the assignments can have unclear directions a lot of the time but for most of the labs walk you through exactly what you need to do
907,Harihar  Khanal,harihar khanal is a nice guy and he knows math rather well however due to his accent it is hard to understand him very well and it is hard to learn from it he does not respond to emails very quickly and he loses some assignments if you turn them in outside of class he tries to have a sense of humor but its more dad jokes really
908,Harihar  Khanal,does not speak comprehensible english you will not understand him he calls n yen and s yes and says yes after every word so when you need s he says yes yes making it impossible to understand there are many other butcheries of the english language he thinks himself hilarious and will laugh at his own jokes and no one understands what said
909,Harihar  Khanal,i am a junior with a and he is the worst teacher i have ever had he skips steps in processes which makes everyone lost is never in his office during his office hours always late to class and receiving text messages and phone calls puts homework on the syllabus and never mentions it and expects it to be done take him
910,Harihar  Khanal,horrible horrible
911,Harihar  Khanal,i take him again nice but that is really the only positive use a textbook or any type of supplementary material during class and very hard to understand comes up with his own examples to present material and the class is left guessing whether or not his work on the board is correct grading is very vague
912,Harihar  Khanal,tough class to pass a little hard to understand him at first but not after a few sessions he makes some hilarious jokes in class dr khanal allows you to replace your lowest test grade with your final grade if higher final multiple choice gives partial credit on everything quizzes are easy and test are kinda hard give extra credit
913,Harihar  Khanal,this professor loves teaching and he complicate the class if you understand he will teach you again and will consider your difficulties on the test this is the kind of teachers who cares about your gpa and you learning i would take another class professor he earned his salary
914,Harihar  Khanal,a good professor after you get used to him it takes about the first week to get over his accent but if you can deal with that then be fine in the class he goes over all the material really well and gives good reviews for tests homework is fairly simple and he grades with lots of partial credit on tests overall pretty good
915,Harihar  Khanal,he is cool professor.his course will have lots of project make sure you are good in matlab he is an easy grader and his tests are very easy.i would suggest to take this professor
916,Harihar  Khanal,very good teacher to have understandable and uses a lot of examples helps with homework and one of the best teachers i have had on campus
917,Harihar  Khanal,was very frustrated first week or so because of his accent but you understand it over time he makes the class easy to understand helps on homeworks quizzes and gives a test review that basically comes from the test amazing teacher to take for calc
918,Harihar  Khanal,has a heavy indian accent after the first week or so he becomes more understandable gives hw assignements as part of the grade he does a lot of examples on the board and relates problems to other classes like physics or to real life situations he is a great teacher and i learned a lot
919,Harihar  Khanal,difficult to understand his accent at first but it gets better gives homework about once a week and helps you if you have problems the day due prepares sample tests very similar to the actual tests which helps a lot
920,Harihar  Khanal,one of the easiest teachers on campus very lenient laid back very helpful when you go meet him in his office has exams a final but the final is optional so if you do well in the exams the homeworks you are good if you did exams bad he replaces your final grade with so that you can get a better grade i recommend you take him
921,Harihar  Khanal,great teacher sometimes hard to understsand loves teaching extremely helpful if you go in his office hours and ask
922,Harihar  Khanal,great teacher very helpful and very determined to help you pass expecially if your math background is not strong he sticks by his office hours so visit him whenever you have a question he has an easygoing kind of character word to the wise make sure to brush up on your trig because your going to need it
923,Harihar  Khanal,very enthusiastic about teaching however he doesnt allow the use of ti83 for any of his exams
924,Harihar  Khanal,easy teacher great to work with if you do the homework class will be easy take it from me im a c person in math in calculus i have a a take him he is worth it
925,Harihar  Khanal,very interesting professor funny accent can be funny at times homeworks are easy at first but gets harder towards the end drops the lowest quiz and hwks with the highest one.final exam is him you can just use the textbook from the library coz u only need it for hwks saves u alot of money
926,Robert  Brannon,take note of every word that comes out of his mouth he would test you on it also read the text because he would test you on that also in all about multiple choice questions in hrs he gives credit for good attendance also other than that he is a nice professor very fair and to the point and the class is interesting
927,Robert  Brannon,if the tests do so detailed i would consider this class interesting and recommend it to others the tests are very doable but just know a lot of questions involve subtle details which can be easily forgotten getting a good grade is definitely possible but just remember the tests are more annoying than they have to be
928,Robert  Brannon,lots of information you want to miss a class because if you miss a note you could miss questions on the test
929,Robert  Brannon,im taking him next semester for social psych and masculinity is that too much of brannon for one semester or will i survive
930,Robert  Brannon,im not going to lie his tests werent easy but if you went to class and took decent notes you should get a pretty good grade the curve didnt help me much because i did good on the tests but if you do bad its a great help i recommend him
931,Robert  Brannon,brannon is the best psych teacher he is clear passionate and extremely fair do not take this class if you are scared of working there is a ton of notes and readings but interesting psych majors do not miss out on any of the classes he offers
932,Robert  Brannon,ok i know what anyone is talking about this class is so boring and tedious insane how much notes are given each and every class and how every single part of it is on the test the test are really hard and need a lot of memorizing but there is a pretty big curve but wayy too much notes every dayy cannot miss anythingg
933,Robert  Brannon,great its not to exciting the class because he just sits there and lectures but great and its easy to pass his class
934,Robert  Brannon,brannon is a boring teacher you have to write down everything that he says it will be on the test what you read in the book is not discussed in class and will be on the test although he is hard he is a great teacher who gives great curves take him
935,Robert  Brannon,this class was greata lot of lecture was till the last minute of like pgs of notes a long as you take good notes and study you can do so well he puts a huge curve on every test you can do really well the tests are like over m.c and some have like choices ag but otherwise hes funny and its a good class
936,Robert  Brannon,what a cool class i had a few good laughs and learned some fun facts he is way cool exams are long but nothing to stress over there should be more professors like him
937,Robert  Brannon,the tests are long and include anything he may have mentioned in class and from the reading in addition each question has to choices however if sufficient notes are taken this class is not hard at all fall asleep or miss a lecture and a few questions on the test are not answerable
938,Robert  Brannon,he gives a full hour and a half of lecture so be ready to take alot of notes his tests are multiple choice so be ready to study good news is that he gives a great curve
939,Robert  Brannon,he might be boring btu take good notes and you will be fine dont forget to read the book its very important his curve is huge and its very easy to get an a but u do have to study in advance for it
940,Robert  Brannon,crazy curve a lot of notes but as long as you are a good note taker then you will do fine i would definately recommend him great prof
941,Robert  Brannon,awesome
942,Robert  Brannon,great teacher you have to read your notes and and the book to do well on the questions testbut the questions are pretty straightforward interesting class
943,Robert  Brannon,a very interesting class there are a lot of notes though the tests are over questions but he gives a great curve a nice professor and gives pretty interesting lectures
944,Robert  Brannon,he gives two test during the semester but the test is questions and sometimes questions are sometimes weird he gives a lovely curve and you must attend all classes to get a decent grade in the class and the lectures are not that bad besides he is the only that teaches the course
945,Robert  Brannon,prof brannon is very good he gives exams but they are very straight forward the exams basically consists of class notes be prepared to take a lot of notes and some from the book he gives a great curve if you receive the highest grade on the midterm you have to take the final.good prof
946,Robert  Lecker,a pretty tough grader and say that if he agrees with what saying do well grading is subjective anyways but he takes it to a new level personally i like him too much the material was pretty interesting on the other hand my ta this year was incredible though
947,Robert  Lecker,i liked lecker his lectures were very interesting and depending on your ta the conferences can really help clarify things if need he has really insightful things to say about what we read very knowledgeable about the authors and encourages people to give their own ideas in class have the readings done before class its a must
948,Robert  Lecker,do not recommend if you are not an engl major its a hard pass not approachable at all and puts himself before his students attendance is mandatory and participation is crucial in class online discussion boards and he keep track of how many times you post midterm and final both essays no other assignments tough grader
949,Robert  Lecker,professor lecker is someone who clearly knows what he is talking about from a point of view if you are not an english major you will find yourself being utterly confused and frustrated in this class he very approachable nor does he try to aid the understanding when it comes to exams he is very vague
950,Robert  Lecker,really challenged me to reflect on what it means to hate people
951,Robert  Lecker,he knows his stuff but not there for his students very distant professor and not very approachable very harsh grader do not take if you are not an english major
952,Robert  Lecker,mailing it in an abomination
953,Robert  Lecker,just not interested anymore so obvious
954,Robert  Lecker,professor lecker is an expert on canadian literature he makes a real effort to help his students succeed not at all an easy class and it really depends on the tas that grade your exams i enjoyed the class and would suggest it to friends remember not an easy a you need to put in the work in order to do well
955,Robert  Lecker,i ended up having to use notes from other canadian lit classes just to understand what was going on in lecture disorganized uninteresting lectures and a prof who listen to constructive criticism from students is a bad combo avoid avoid avoid
956,Robert  Lecker,most uninteresting painfully suicidal class ever do not take if you like to think freely and interpret literature the way it is supposed to besubjective he wants you to think like him so in the end you are only pleasing the prof zero motivation and interest to attend his class most people are bored to death
957,Robert  Lecker,very boring class pretends to want to get to know you but he secretly wants you to think just like his interpretations lectures are painful to get through
958,Robert  Lecker,lecker is awesome engage with him get to know him get so defensive about the supposed ego that everyone on here is talking about and just let him open your eyes a little you might like what you see you might not but either way taking his class is essential for learning how to talk about art
959,Robert  Lecker,fairly unintelligent and narcissistic as the day is long if you accidentally make him feel threatened your grade will suffer as his grading method is entirely subjective
960,Robert  Lecker,has a true passion for canadian literature and is one of the best professors to study under if you wish to learn more in that field he gets you into a routine of writing constantly which is tough at times but gets you engaged a little intimidating to speak in front of sometimes in the lectures but there are conferences and a discussion board
961,Robert  Lecker,he specifically sets up the assignments to make everyon arrive in class having done the readings and to help people keep up and do well it was tough having a mini paper due twice a week but then we got to revise them and submit the worth all together for the grade no midterm or final he encourages discussion and coming to his office
962,Robert  Lecker,beyond useless
963,Robert  Lecker,people that dont like lecker do not apply themselves in class he is beyond helpful always encourages students to see him in office hours he encourages participation which makes the class more interesting take a class with him great prof
964,Robert  Lecker,he picks favorites and if not on his good side or you agree with his ideas he makes you pay i have never had an issue with a professor but he is awful trust me stay away
965,Robert  Lecker,prof lecker changed my life perspective made me a better writer and helped me find a career all in one course i found him to be a fascinating lecturer although the course i took with him was a conference of not a lecture he was always very interested in his students and visiting him at office hours is great he is challenging awesome
966,Weinberger,she is the cutest funniest most dramatic professor ever the information she presents is organized and she always allows for some extra credit
967,Weinberger,class was interesting sometimes we went off topic but we usually went back on tests and they are not soo easy i didnt do so well but that may be partially my fault her tests are vert hard and wordy she doesnt give extra credit if you need it good luck
968,Weinberger,one of the worst professors in terms of relaying course content all she does is talk about her family friends and celebrities she met she is totally disorganised and always strays from the topic to actually learn something from this class i would suggest that you not take her
969,Weinberger,hands down the best professor ever had in brooklyn college she is hysterically funny and makes class soo much fun take her before she leaves brooklyn college
970,Weinberger,she is great all around very efficient
971,Weinberger,she is a nice professor her tests are a few questions but you have to do the work so it can take some time she gives quizes b4 tests that you never get back in time same for her tests she allows a cheat sheet try to get tahell for lab natasha basically teaches everything sarah did which helpful gives hw every monday i recommend her
972,Weinberger,excellent professor funny intelligent and very clear in her expectations do not miss class or lab you will regret it the class moves quickly and easy but very thorough read the book do homework and study go for tutoring in learning center if you need it do exactly as she says and you will do fine
973,Weinberger,how are her exams what is the format of the class how is her grading
974,Weinberger,she goes off on a tangent and doesnt teach half of what she planned plus she takes forever to grade our papers
975,Weinberger,she seem to know everything she is teaching only focuses on what she likes but not on the whole subject not too bad overall though
976,Weinberger,no comments
977,Weinberger,i recommend anyone who has to take stats should make sure they take with her she explains everything so well and makes sure everyone understands the material very upbeat and refreshing which helps for a stats class especially at night
978,Weinberger,sarah is the best is by far the best class had at brooklyn college not only is she fun passionate about her work and i never wanted to miss class she makes it easy for you to pass with a good grade just too cool i admire her a great deal she acts like she owns the place cause confident
979,Weinberger,good prof
980,Weinberger,excellent prof upbeat optimistic and explains the not so easy material very clearly she makes this class enjoyable and fun which is a real feat also she does not have to prove that she is superior like some other professors have to.would highly reccommend her
981,Weinberger,thanks professor i enjoyed your class
982,Weinberger,no comments
983,Weinberger,good teacher good class
984,Weinberger,sarah is one of my best teacher cos she is so enthusiastic and covers so much interesting material
985,Weinberger,i definitely agree not the best teacher but she is entertaining and the material is pretty intersting her clothing are great but yea what is going on with that couch blazer its looks like an old couch that she made into a jacket
986,Daniel  Kurylo,the tests can be difficult but he prepares you well via in class lectures he keeps the lectures engaging by constantly sharing anecdotes and telling jokes attendance is only of the grade but if you come to class be prepared to fail
987,Daniel  Kurylo,consistent organized knowledgeable thorough testsyou must study attendance is expected hard to make up missed class tells real life stories has refreshing bit of humor will help student prepare for exam by office hours you need notes to explain power point lectures you might manage without book readings but helpful great prof
988,Daniel  Kurylo,great professor the key to getting a good grade in this class is really just paying attention to his lectures taking good notes and studying he makes all the neuroscience material understandable with the way he explains things he also always provides reallife examples relating to the lecture and enjoyable to listen to bc funny
989,Daniel  Kurylo,very very funny guy whose jokes go over heads day in and out knowledgeable and will engage with you if you ask thoughtful questions can be snarky though doesnt seem to love having to teach tests are very text dependant dont dare think you can rely on slides if you are interested in material this guy can really help you get it but no easy a
990,Daniel  Kurylo,one of the best professors at bc dr k is very knowledgeable in the subject of neuroscience the lectures are kind of stale but he has the best stories to tell which helps the material stick also hilarious yes his exams are difficult so you must keep up on your studying take him if you can
991,Daniel  Kurylo,one of the best things that happened in my life was having him as my professor i feel bad that the semester has came to an end he is brilliant
992,Daniel  Kurylo,lord have mercy
993,Daniel  Kurylo,if a student who is horrible at taking exams or actually have a life and have to work in order to pay for college do not take any course with professor kurylo his class is exams and attendance no extra credit no project and no presentation he does not care if you fail
994,Daniel  Kurylo,i thought he was weird at first but i grew to love his weirdness i love his sarcasm i only pay attention to catch the few sarcastic jokes he throws out good guy teaches clearly he also makes funny faces without noticing super interesting haha
995,Daniel  Kurylo,prof kurylo is not the typical college professor that just want you to memorize a bunch of stuff and then feed it back on a paper he really expect you to think on his test it is more benefit for you to understand why rather than just study like a robot
996,Daniel  Kurylo,this is my third time taking one of classes and i am still very happy with his teaching and testing techniques the test are fairly difficult but there is always a curve as long as you are a good note taker you will be fine also read the stories and diagrams in the textbook almost always at least one question related to them on exam
997,Daniel  Kurylo,he is awesome grades are only tests attendance is but i recommend you attend every class because he explains the information thoroughly he gives out lecture notes a few days before the exam memorize it and do good his tests are short answer but some require only one word answers he is soo funnyy i am def taking him again
998,Daniel  Kurylo,i took his class and enjoyed it he gave curves and i got a b without studying much you really have to listen in class and take notes very intelligent guy he makes a few jokes which are missed by most of the class
999,Daniel  Kurylo,extremely interesting class explains things well tests arent easy but he cuts a lot of slack int he grading your grade is just your tests so if you dont do well on one tests get a bad grade on the course
1000,Daniel  Kurylo,i took both physiological psych and human neuropsych with prof kurylo and both classes were amazing he is very sarcastic which makes the learning fun pay attention in class read the assigned chapters and you should do well smart guy take him
1001,Daniel  Kurylo,extremely hard class this professor knows his stuff but really know how to teach his class is extremely boring so its super hard to pay attention and stay focused as much as u try his tests are ridiculously hard no matter how much u study.i would really avoid taking his class
1002,Daniel  Kurylo,funny professor kinda quirky but he delivers the material in a way that its interesting short answer exams that are straight forward and he give you some slack on the answers would take him again
1003,Daniel  Kurylo,good luck if you have this professor he is knowledgable but his class is so boring i got an a but by writing everything he said even his boring stories because it will be on the test read the book because you will be teaching yourself only thing good about his class is that he curves the tests because everyone fails do your best
1004,Daniel  Kurylo,take this class if you have really good vision cause he writes in like font on the board and if you like sleeping because what be doing in this class a really knowledgeable professor but he know how to put it into use and his voice makes most people sleepy tests are pretty hard too
1005,Daniel  Kurylo,omg i took intro to physiological psych and i hated the class so much i had a really hard time trying to pass every single detail that he speaks about in class is in the test things that you would think be on the the test are on the test he is funny in a weird way and he knows his stuff but he teach and the class is so difficult
1006,Andrew  Delamater,good teacher no hw or quizzes just exams exams were difficult but open book if you show up to lecture every day and ask questions it shouldnt be too hard also his grading rubric is very generous
1007,Andrew  Delamater,delamater is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot to say this can work against him however because he will often go on and on about something that could have been said in minutes he is also disrespectfulmaking students feel embarrassed for saying the wrong thing mocking students rolling his eyes
1008,Andrew  Delamater,i dont recommend him he know how to explain no extra credit no homework no study guide three exams extremely hard you have to study on your own and read the book a few times to get the concepts well
1009,Andrew  Delamater,no extra credits no extra assignments test and final tests are hard but based on the book so if you read you should do fine
1010,Andrew  Delamater,the professor knows the topic however he relay them well he explains a topic in minutes and you understand it but then takes the remainder of the class over explaining it so that everyone is then totally lost i recommend taking him
1011,Andrew  Delamater,this professor really knows his stuff because he is really knowledgeable in this area he sometimes forgets that his students may not be so you need to ask him to explain in a different way he also tries to explain the theories using lots of examples and dumbs things down so everyone gets it exams are hard and require work but he is a great
1012,Andrew  Delamater,i do not recommend this professor at all.his exams is unfair and does no show interest in students however the lab section is great brianna young the lab assistant is great
1013,Andrew  Delamater,i highly recommend lectures were crystal clear and based on the book he always gave examples to support the theories he discussed and his exams were fair you just have to put in the effort and study take him i really enjoyed his class
1014,Andrew  Delamater,the material is challenging but delameter knows his stuff never had any problems asking him questions he gets a bad rap i suspect because most people around here want to put in the effort be screwed at other schools attend class study ask questions the class was interesting and he was super cool
1015,Andrew  Delamater,if you want to waste money if you really care about your gpa if you want to struggle if you are interested in hours of boring lectures than this class is for you enough said
1016,Andrew  Delamater,he makes the class harder than it actual should be just a midterm and a are both so hard he allow any eating in his class and if he sees you eating get ready to walk out the room throw it out or put it away if you ask a question and he feels it is stupid oh man he will make sure to tell you that
1017,Andrew  Delamater,this is a very hard class but if you do not follow than you are in trouble the learning theory is no joke and dr delamater knows his stuff if you go to his office hours he well help you out if you want a challange take his class its not always about
1018,Andrew  Delamater,this is a joke why is he still teaching knows his stuff but does not know how to teach no mercy run
1019,Andrew  Delamater,he really does curse alot to grab the students attn there are extra credit attendance matter on the first day of class he said an and anything below is an f in the past most students got ds or fs i hope he was joking
1020,Andrew  Delamater,terrible professor insults students in class makes students look stupid if they dont know an answer would not recomend
1021,Andrew  Delamater,amazing professor very interesting material i learned a lot i highly recommend his graduate class
1022,Andrew  Delamater,this professor is really bady i loved the course itself but did not enjoy his teaching at all he can be very rude and does not give of his time to students
1023,Andrew  Delamater,very boring lecture he has to curse a lot to get the attention a good professor does not have to do that
1024,Andrew  Delamater,professor delamater is great he is very tough but he makes you work hard and you learn a lot this is not an easy a class but if you think you are smart enough to read a book you will have no problems
1025,Andrew  Delamater,lectures are boring and information is unclear he is very unprofessional and treats you like an idiot if you are not understanding the info he plays favorites and ignores the students who have difficulty in class
1026,Israel  Abramov,this professor is terrible terrible terrible avoid at all costs you have been warned this professor gives exams which are multiple choice but extremely difficult extremely it gets better though the final is mc questions which is cumulative from the beginning of the semester save your gpa take this with someone else
1027,Israel  Abramov,this professor is terrible terrible terrible terrible avoid at all costs you have been warned this professor gives exams which are multiple choice but extremely difficult extremely it gets better though the final is multiple questions which is cumulative from the beginning of the semester save your gpa take this with someone else
1028,Israel  Abramov,great professor
1029,Israel  Abramov,long lectures funny no homework
1030,Israel  Abramov,your grade is divided into tests and final exam all are based on the textbook yet lectures are just simplified coverage of the textbook if you actively reading the textbook the whole semester like i did have a very tough time with the tests very knowledgeable but should be avoided for the sake of your gpa
1031,Israel  Abramov,long long lectures
1032,Israel  Abramov,he is very knowledgeable in this subject however he has a hard time passing that on to his students i am currently sitting in this class completely lost
1033,Israel  Abramov,he reads his slides and posts them on cuny blackboard he gets his slides from the textbook but do not miss his class especially first years it really makes a difference going to his class no matter how boring he is
1034,Israel  Abramov,its very clear that knowledgeable about the subject but terrible at conveying that knowledge to his students lectures are unclear tests are tricky his notes are useless for studying and overall do not recommend
1035,Israel  Abramov,his exams are incredibly specific and unless you start studying weeks before the exam do not expect higher than a on any of his tests i rewrote the entire textbook and went to the learning center to review for his class i ended up getting an a but i worked for it he knows his exams are hard though so a bit more lenient with the gradin
1036,Israel  Abramov,overall an average professor gives good explanations requires a lot of textbook reading because his lectures are very vague tests are pretty tough but if you read the textbook you will pass
1037,Israel  Abramov,read this very carefully do not take this man do yourself a favor and take another psych class bc the only one that gives his lectures have excessive information and its hard to keep up in class beware of cumulative final its impossible to pass like i said do yourself a favor and do not take him im warning you your gpa dies
1038,Israel  Abramov,great guy not so great lecturer
1039,Israel  Abramov,if you dont have the best memory and have issues professors who say thats the text book now go read it do not take him i have no doubt that he was once a good look at the amount journals he has published over the past decades and how his reviews have gotten worse over time long story short if you take him be ready to read for hours
1040,Israel  Abramov,horrible always late to class and lectures are not clear at all
1041,Israel  Abramov,his lectures are great he puts up detailed lecture notes on blackboard he does his best to help the students try to read the textbook read the summary section at least there are exams and a final all of which are multiple choices
1042,Israel  Abramov,professor abramov where do i even begin his notes are confusing and his tests are extremely hard he comes into class talks for minutes and then you leave and have to read the textbook front to back the final was chapters he should retire expect to self teach yourself everything he is too difficult for an introduction course
1043,Israel  Abramov,if you want to be happy then take him a nice man but basically an independentstudy his tests even in english
1044,Israel  Abramov,abramov was great he was easy to understand his lectures were easy to keep up with and hilarious read the chapter before class and do great only tests no midterm and they are multiple choice questions taking the final on monday fairly confident read the chapters textbooks in the reserves and participate pass
1045,Israel  Abramov,he really knows what he is talking about but his lessons are more than boring his review is going back through the slides already seen and there any new information he gives you in review his tests are extremely hard and specific great man terrible professor
1046,John  MacKo,very easy going and helpful great teacher i learned so much from him
1047,John  MacKo,very unprofessional and takes the internet way to seriously he needs to focus on being a teacher rather than getting butthurt over someones opinion
1048,John  MacKo,knew what he was talking about but understand the wording on some of his test questions i had the whole class on my side after explaining a question and listening to his reason for his answer but he would not listen he marked me wrong for a question that everyone knows i got right he just understand the meanings of some words
1049,John  MacKo,macko is an awesome teacher
1050,John  MacKo,macko is the man
1051,John  MacKo,this guy really knew what he was talking about great teacher and good guy to help you out if you get him as a teacher pay attention and you will do fine but prepare to watch him fly as he demonstrates camber roll
1052,Aaron  Kozbelt,such a gen he genuinely cares that you understand answer any questions some homework but fair and the lab helps you do it great really he knows what doing gives reviews
1053,Aaron  Kozbelt,wouldnt retake this class with him hes good at teachin but for some reason some of the concepts were presented too difficult to remember throughout the course he does allow cheat sheets for exams but make them quick to understand b c it can slow you down make sure cheat sheets have examples of steps for specific problems rather than definitions
1054,Aaron  Kozbelt,aaron kozbelt knows his subject and he knows how to explain concepts he is organized his presentations are clear would have liked to have him for other courses some professors at brooklyn college should be watching him teach so they can brush up on their lecture skills
1055,Aaron  Kozbelt,amazing angel of a professor dr kozbelt is an interesting professor his lectures are clear and concise and he is very understanding and reasonable even in a graduate level class take him
1056,Aaron  Kozbelt,respected organized and professional he gives over hard concepts in a clear manner a focused setting
1057,Aaron  Kozbelt,the class is hard you have to work for your grade but hands down the best stats professor at brooklyn college take him
1058,Aaron  Kozbelt,an overall nice guy but this class is very stressful if you good at math you will struggle it was hard to follow along and there much tutoring hours my ta help much and from what i heard the other ones either if feeling lost and it seem any better drop the class he tried to help though
1059,Aaron  Kozbelt,personally i think he is the best professor in brooklyn college simply not enough space to tell you all the good things about him he really makes it easy to do well in a tough class show up to class and take notes make sure you understand the material and you will do not just fine but get an a if you want to understand stats you must take him
1060,Aaron  Kozbelt,he is the best for statistics homework total super eas y if you go to class three exams including the final and you are allow to bring cheats sheets for the three exams also the final is very easy take him if you want to learn statistics
1061,Aaron  Kozbelt,i have other stats classes that i have taken to compare him to and hands down i wish i would have had him first one of the most understanding statistics professors ever had makes the lessons clear to understand offers extra help in any way he can the material is hard but you leave understanding statistics the way he teaches it
1062,Aaron  Kozbelt,psych stats is difficult but having professor kozbelt alleviates some of the challenge i love that he is very fair very helpful clear he is organized knows what he is doing and makes everyone in the class feel like they can ask questions sitting in a lecture hall i was surprised when he remembered my name kozbelt is very professional
1063,Aaron  Kozbelt,every professor should be like professor kozbelt he was hands down my favorite teacher in college i still miss his class one year later yes stats is a challenging class but for people going into this field and wishing to succeed challenges need to be overcome this teacher will fully equip you with what you need if you want to do well
1064,Aaron  Kozbelt,he makes statistics very understandable the course does not have as much math as i feared i suck at math and this class was my favorite hws which you need at least an hour for weekly quizzes worth each exams and a final regret not taking him he is the best professor for psych stats and learn a lot oh and a cutie
1065,Aaron  Kozbelt,great professor stats is not an easy class but he makes it very easy to learn and understandable just make sure to attend class and do the work and get a good grade also very willing to help reading the textbook is helpful but not necessary he also allows cheat sheets on the exams
1066,Aaron  Kozbelt,i love this man its impossible not to learn the material he honestly puts every effort into making you understand the material in an easy way he has such a sweet personality is very understanding stats too hard but you should put effort into listening and reading your notes completely completely recommend this professor the best
1067,Aaron  Kozbelt,this professor is very understanding patient and understands his material well it is impossible for you not understand the material with that said this course is anything but a walk in the park you need to buckle down and read the textbook like its got the meaning of life hidden in it somewhere.beware exams are a killer
1068,Aaron  Kozbelt,awesome proffesor you have to work to get a a gives homeworks and quizzes every week but they are very helpful when it comes to the exams exams are tough but if you study and practice the hw and book problems then you have nothing to worry about
1069,Aaron  Kozbelt,he has a sweet personality loves teaching statistics the course is very hard but he teaches everything with clarity the quizzes and help boost the grade totally recommended
1070,Aaron  Kozbelt,if you learn stats from this man you should remove yourself from the gene pool the nicest most patient professor ever had explains everything and answers even the stupidest questions in a clear and humble manner
1071,Aaron  Kozbelt,professors need to have a lot of knowledge and know how to teach and kozbelt is very good with both for psy quiz every week helps keep things fresh for the tests just take good notes listen to how he outlines to course and read the textbook hes really smart and a good teacher
1072,Dorathea  Halpert,this is by far the worst class i have ever taken in bc because of this teacher a really interesting topic can truly be ruined by the teacher the only way to do decently is to read all chapters at least times which is ipossible she is so unclear and talks about everything other than the class subject run
1073,Dorathea  Halpert,omg a topic that actually interested in happened turn in2 the most boring thing ever
1074,Dorathea  Halpert,very boring but easy as long as you read the book and know it well you will be fine forget about taking notes i got an a and managed to enjoy most of the class
1075,Dorathea  Halpert,she has her favorites in her class which i think is right some of her lectures make no sense but she is a very nice lady
1076,Dorathea  Halpert,ever take this professor this is the worst professor at bc
1077,Dorathea  Halpert,i enjoy her class her tests are hard because she know how to teach she goes off topic a lot and goes into irrevelent things because she thinks clear and helpful my advice is to ask her for a review sheet it helps a bit and lets you focus on what to study for no curves and difficult to get good grades in this class many ds
1078,Dorathea  Halpert,very nice and understanding woman but very difficult to learn from
1079,Dorathea  Halpert,she is not the worst teacher pretty boring but her tests do not reflect anything from the class i never missed a class and actually took notes and also read most of the textbook but still did not do so well if you do end up taking her no point in going to class it help her tests are hard and hardly anyone gets an a
1080,Dorathea  Halpert,awful teacher you will not get an a in the class unless u can repeat the words in verbatim worst teacher in the department i hope she gets fired
1081,Dorathea  Halpert,in psy she is extremely boring my advice unkless you read the textbook before the semester began give up run and find another teacher for psy she gives you the essay questions just make sure each essay is at least exam booklet pages and front
1082,Dorathea  Halpert,oh my goodness what a such a nice lady why i feel horrible for saying this but she is undeniably boringshe goes from a to d to z and then back to extremely difficult to stay awake
1083,Dorathea  Halpert,the lectures are boring and very unclear professor is very unclear about the information and is over the exams are insanely weird and unclear if you can take this class with a different professor do so
1084,Dorathea  Halpert,i truely recommend her to anyone she is one horrible teacher to get she is not helpful at all and almost everyone in class fails and she even give out fs but d which is more terrible ever take her bad unhelpful professor ever
1085,Dorathea  Halpert,this is the worst prof i have taken both classes i took with her were difficult she is as far as i am concern an incompetent teaher she never followed the book which was confusing she made it even worst please please please do not take her please
1086,Dorathea  Halpert,nice professor but the exams are tricky this class comprise of class notes therefore you have to focus solely on the book which is complex she tries to help students boost their grade by adding an extra credit assignment hard class i had to struggle to pass
1087,Dorathea  Halpert,very kind and understanding professor but her teaching leaves a lot to be desired it is almost impossible to take notes as the lectures are so random the class was never really boring but i never felt like i got much out of the class either if you take this professor read the book
1088,Dorathea  Halpert,boring professor with crazy hard multiple choice exams no curve at all even though most of the class failed child psych can be a really interesting subject but she makes it torture slept through all her classes studied like an animal for the tests and barely managed to pull off and
1089,Dorathea  Halpert,a nice person and class is really just for grade.read the text because the tests require very detailed answers almost verbatem for a decent score strangest of all is you actually leave class more confused then you went in so just stick to what the book says
1090,Dorathea  Halpert,floater the text is the teacher
1091,Dorathea  Halpert,the class is pretty boring everyone walked away from both tests thinking they did well but the class average for both tests was in the with the highest mark in the class only being in the final was the same but longer i lost some of my interest in the topic after taking the class
1092,Phillip  Anz-Meador,he obviously knows his stuff but his teaching methods really help either only theory without showing how to apply to any problem or he gives an example problem with a solution method that only works on that problem i found that going to tutoring was a better way to learn the material i would recommend him over some other teachers
1093,Phillip  Anz-Meador,certainly not afraid to say on his mind he speaks perfectly clearly i got an a in the class and felt so good because of it apparently not an easy class the subject material is easy but you absolutely must be prepared for the tests as they are very thorough i say they are too hard though they are fair
1094,Phillip  Anz-Meador,his classes are work intensive he takes the either learn the material or fail the class approach
1095,Phillip  Anz-Meador,though the course is harder than most of the students head that go to that school this teacher explains the subject almost as clear as it can be need office hour time just go he is always willing to help
1096,Phillip  Anz-Meador,if you show up for extra help when offered at the end of every week do very well otherwise be sure to study the hell out of the material difficult work make it easier for yourself by taking the help he offers

1099,Phillip  Anz-Meador,no comments
1100,Phillip  Anz-Meador,took it in summer physics is hard and he tries to make it as clear as he can if you dont understand ask questions not something most people can just pick up me included helpful and funny too good guy
1101,Phillip  Anz-Meador,best ps instructor i had at riddle
1102,Phillip  Anz-Meador,his favorite word is crap which is kool
1103,Phillip  Anz-Meador,great professor very smart he realizes that physics can be tough and will help you out pretty much anytime that he has free time
1104,Phillip  Anz-Meador,good teacher though class can sometimes get a bit monotonous if you need help with anything always happy to answer and he also holds study sessions for tests his tests throw random curveballs and are based on important concepts in physics
1105,Phillip  Anz-Meador,hey those who left a poor quality on anzmeador seriously if you want to become an engineer you have to know your physics down to your brain hour in class you spend spend atleast hours extra those engineers who leave a poor quality in this professor obvious that you study
1106,Phillip  Anz-Meador,makes pilot classes easy hahahaha engineers
1107,Phillip  Anz-Meador,extremely unorganized to the point that it creates problems for the students very unhelpful and extremely difficult to understand avoid this class like the plague
1108,Phillip  Anz-Meador,he know how to teach outside of engineering physics became extremely complex he changes units at least times a problem on tests and goes between metric and us units often confusing
1109,Phillip  Anz-Meador,space environment is a great class
1110,Phillip  Anz-Meador,he is an ok teacher but needs to be teaching the engineers not the pilots
1111,Phillip  Anz-Meador,aarrggh he is so fricking unbelievable decent guy but the bugger know how to teach he makes physics sound like rocket science and makes ants at a picnic the end of the world i like his texan accent though
1112,Thomas  Pynadath,insulting and condescending still got a in his class
1113,Thomas  Pynadath,just dont do it most of his class failed his test highest grade was a c just drop it or take another teacher
1114,Thomas  Pynadath,for the love of godstay away from this prof
1115,Thomas  Pynadath,dr pynadath did a great job teaching the difficulty of his tests were such that his teaching exellence was required
1116,Thomas  Pynadath,this class sucks dont take it if you dont have to he is very unclear foriegn and doesnt help with any problems his tests are awfull save yourselves now and take chem teacher
1117,Thomas  Pynadath,no comments
1118,Thomas  Pynadath,he is a little hard to understand at first but just make sure to do all the work he gives you it may be a lot but it guarantees you a decent grade sometimes his explanations great but you can look in the book if confused
1119,Thomas  Pynadath,no comments
1120,Thomas  Pynadath,he tries to cover way too much material at one time he goes way too fast he is very intelligent but he explain it in simple terms
1121,Solomon  Eisenberg,he already doesnt care about has all of the personailty traits we condesending selfcentered if you want a challenge be my guest
1122,Solomon  Eisenberg,he is one of the most arrogant individuals ever met has zero people skills and admit when wrong if he realizes that wrong just rip on you to deflect attention from himself
1123,Solomon  Eisenberg,quite possibly the most arrogant professor i have ever come across screw up in front of him he just loves to make you look stupid
1124,Kenneth  Loparo,no clear enough he seems not understand the lecture
1125,Kenneth  Loparo,professor loparo is a really cool guy gives out extra credits when indians won and going to class before holidays the class material is hard but if you do the assigned homework you will be fine quizzes are easy as long as you do the homework final is kind of hard but he curves
1126,Kenneth  Loparo,very fast lecturer and hard to understand will not slow down or help any student during class final was not representative of the quizzes throughout the year attendance dropped so low mediavision was added and extra credit given out to those who went to class avoid this class at all costs
1127,Kenneth  Loparo,the class is easy you can learn by yourself without spending more money in this semester
1128,Kenneth  Loparo,the lecture is hard unclear
1129,Kenneth  Loparo,just soso
1130,Kenneth  Loparo,extraordinarily smart and knows his material the department chair and rightfully so
1131,Kenneth  Loparo,loparo is easily one of the best professors at case his lectures are crystal clear even when the material gets complicated tests are very difficult but he does curve go to every class worth it bonus for attending preholiday lectures
1132,Kenneth  Loparo,loparo is a great guy and a great professor he talks and writes clearly and tells you what you need to know easily one of the best professors at cwru tests and projects are difficult but he does curve the class oh yeah he gives extra credit for the browns winning and for going to class
1133,Kenneth  Loparo,even though he writes fast but he speaks loud and clear in class he is a good professor
1134,Kenneth  Loparo,i heart loparo
1135,Kenneth  Loparo,this class is pretty difficult and he does a lot of intense mathematical derivation sometimes without the basics or nontechnical explanation of going on very helpful outside of class though and is a really really nice guy
1136,Kenneth  Loparo,totally excellent
1137,Kenneth  Loparo,always gave help on coursework and excellent advice on my my advisor
1138,Kenneth  Loparo,brilliant lectures goes fast but keeps it interesting
1139,Kenneth  Loparo,best teacher in the department
1140,Kenneth  Loparo,provides lots of information it would be nice to see applications sometimes
1141,Kenneth  Loparo,if you want a good grade plan on taking his class several times
1142,Kenneth  Loparo,this a genius but is out of touch the class lectures at light speed
1143,Kenneth  Loparo,knows his circuits
1144,Thomas  Hirschl,try to be objective and critical something that this professor is not the most bs class ever taken his lectures are tangental without evidence and leaves you thinking that only of what he said is true his exam questions are his interpretations of the readings not the actual points any answer could be correct
1145,Thomas  Hirschl,a terrible lecturer goes on tangents so often he also sometimes confuses himself sitting in class i hear a lot of snickering from the classmates when he says something that make sense which is a lot my ta is respectful but even he knew that the lecturers help much mc tests are vague prelim averages were
1146,Thomas  Hirschl,actually the worst professor had at cornell i care if he is a brilliant researcher he had no investment in the class terrible lectures and had no care whatsoever what students took away from his class truly terrible
1147,Thomas  Hirschl,i remember that in the first lecture prof hirschl was making his powerpoint slides in class yes in class while he was lecturing his lectures were so random he started off talking about the reading made a few completely unrelated points and he started criticizing some other sociologist and then another sociologist and then another
1148,Thomas  Hirschl,lectures are scattered and his explanations of concepts are very vague i did not know what developmental sociology was until our ta explained it halfway through the semester he uses examples that are not thought out and you could argue that all choices on his multiple choice questions are correct even so the class is super easy
1149,Thomas  Hirschl,first two readings were hard rest was pretty easy actually pretty interesting
1150,Thomas  Hirschl,hirschl was an okay professor your success in the class really depends on the quality of your ta if you have a bad ta who hand back assignments and cover all of the required material for the week because runs out of time then your grades will likely suffer there are weekly assignments but the workload too bad
1151,Thomas  Hirschl,if you want to be constantly indoctrinated with socialst ideas take this course hirschl legitimately spends most of his time in lecture pushing an agenda infuriating when the garbage spewing is coming out of the mouth of a bumbling idiot that said this class is an absolute joke and if you have a functioning brain an easy a
1152,Thomas  Hirschl,this class was useless but i took it for the easy a literally rarely came to class but came to all of the sections and did the readings take it for the diversity distribution requirement you regret it
1153,Thomas  Hirschl,take it for the diversity credit and just get out with an a
1154,Thomas  Hirschl,i actually learned a lot about things of social importance in this class and it opened my eyes to the world after taking only science classes prior to it i hardly went to lecture but the material was interesting and it was an easy a in section we had one paper that even graded exams were somewhat tough but curved high
1155,Thomas  Hirschl,prof hirschl is awful dsoc is awful if you do the work you will get a good grade but the amount of work is obscene for such a stupid class hirschl tests you on his own material and his own views i didnt know what sociology was until i looked it up three weeks into class he makes you buy books for two chapters avoid if you enjoy sanit y
1156,Thomas  Hirschl,if you try get a good grade hirschl hates economics and spends most of the time explaining his own views and supporting himself with questionable evidence whenever he uses scientific evidence as support he looks foolish to the science majors all correct answers on exams are variations of whites men are oppressing blacks women
1157,Thomas  Hirschl,these other ratings are bogus this was one of the best classes i took at cornell learn too much busy easy a engaging lecture and such a really nice guy prelims final section attendance and discussion is all would def take again
1158,Thomas  Hirschl,this is the worst class ever taken at cornell hirschl hates economics as a consequently economics majors like myself and is the most boring lecturer ever even the books he chose were biased perrucci and wysong thought d.a.r.e was a conspiracy to distract the masses from social inequality i got an but learn much
1159,Thomas  Hirschl,i am an applied engineering physics major and i had a until i took dsoc.i had to pull allnighters every other day to keep up with the work.this class ruined my more importantly my life.the triple integrals he puts on the exam are ridiculously hard to solve.bring a graphing calculator to the some extra batteries just in case
1160,Thomas  Hirschl,this guy is amazing but if you become his friend his class will become even more amazing and he will fascinate you to no end he is a great person who knows a lot and is willing to share but only if he likes you and you get to know him so get to know him and it will be a great experience class was pretty easy not about the grade with him
1161,Thomas  Hirschl,if you are a legitimate student this will be cake so easy but i hated myself for taking it he is biased and the worst thing was that the types even see through his garbage enough to be outraged unless you need a gpa boost badly take this class it was the worst one taken since middle school
1162,Thomas  Hirschl,really easy class and the topics are interesting but he presents it in a way that really hold your interest really need to go to class to do well
1163,Thomas  Hirschl,easy class sweet professor no studying necessary
1164,Michael  Scanlin,never attend and you will receive an a easiest professor i have ever taken and one of the kindest
1165,Michael  Scanlin,mindblowing show up and pass class
1166,Michael  Scanlin,dr scanlin is such a great guy all he wants is for his students to pass his class and do great after graduation you pretty much watch movies every other class and he rarely takes attendance before a test he gives you loads of questions and the answers you just have to memorize them this class is a great gpa booster
1167,Michael  Scanlin,he really wants us to be educated and goes out of his way enormously to help his students a great professor and a great advisor funny too take his class
1168,Michael  Scanlin,this was a very boring class he would go off on long discussions about topics we care less about tests required memorizing answers to study guide questions you certainly actually learn any of this stuff overall nice guy though and definitely loves what he teaches
1169,Michael  Scanlin,he gives you the test pretty much he has outlines for every section he will go over know these in and out cause they will be the short essays
1170,Michael  Scanlin,geosystems great class but he changed the tests from mulitple choice to short essay tests a bit harder than he used to be but a great guy and videos in class are pretty sweet
1171,Michael  Scanlin,very funny guy and the class bad either
1172,Michael  Scanlin,dr s is def awesome he is so helpful with everything and is more than willing to go out of his way to help his students
1173,Michael  Scanlin,so cool will help you out as much as he can and is very flexable just dont be an ass and youll be ok i love this teacher
1174,Michael  Scanlin,dr s is so great he is by far the coolest professor had so far he really cares about his students and his skeptics manifesto class is awesome so if an honors studentdefinitely take this course
1175,Michael  Scanlin,take the manifesto not just because you want an easy grade which it is but because interested because you will learn a lot get an a and have an awesome professor who somehow can relate anything to hilarious prof
1176,Michael  Scanlin,scanlin is the man it doesnt get cooler than him
1177,Michael  Scanlin,well i must say scanlin is a nice guy his awesome haircut wonderful ways with words kept me entertained all semester long
1178,Michael  Scanlin,i love scanlin soo nice and really cares about his students
1179,Michael  Scanlin,very knowledgable in topics other than rocks no bush
1180,Michael  Scanlin,no comments
1181,Michael  Scanlin,not always clear but alwasy entertaining and very sweet
1182,Michael  Scanlin,a bit crazy and unclear but very helpful and entertaining really nice guy
1183,Peter  Jurs,i had jurs for my chem freshman seminar the class was possibly the most pointless ever assignments were easy but too much so grades are partially attendancebased so go to the beginning of class sign in and get out of there when you find an excuse
1184,Peter  Jurs,lectures are beyond boring but the information is important i have nothing against jurs the chem course was my problem
1185,Peter  Jurs,this class is the hardest one of the most boring classes you will take the workload is alot when u have no idea wat your doing you skip around in the book until your confused as hell i feel sorry for anyone taking chem at least you have jurs
1186,Peter  Jurs,dr jurs does what he is supposed to he reviews and supplements what is in the text he answers questions clearly when asked it is about as interesting as chemistry can be made the course is a lot of work reading and problems there is a lot of personal responsibility here there are plenty of oppurtunites for a good grade just doing the work
1187,Peter  Jurs,terrible class absolutely boring and poor lectures taught myself chemistry from the book because i take sitting through the lecture if you have to take the first year chem lab bless your soul
1188,Peter  Jurs,this is a hard class but dr jurs a bad teacher the information being taught is diffucult to understand as well as being a lot at one time
1189,Peter  Jurs,because chem is a lecture class the prof can seem unhelpful but dr jurs is very helpful if you approach him
1190,Peter  Jurs,definitely a better chem lecturer knows what talking about and his lectures are worth attending notes and lectures are organized clear and welldeveloped not actually in his section but attended his lectures because greenberg was awful jurs is a nice guy
1191,Peter  Jurs,he was a terrible teacher i know a general class required for most science majors but come on try to make it a little interesting i hated this class with a passion thank goodness i am done with it
1192,Peter  Jurs,chem is chem not very fun he does his best much better than any other prof you could have for the course he tries to be cool blows stuff up alot
1193,Peter  Jurs,can be dry at times but a nice guy overall wizard of whitmore can be funny great attitude knows what doing and teaches very well
1194,Peter  Jurs,it is ok
1195,Peter  Jurs,good teacher easy to follor lots of demonstartions in class to keep your attention
1196,Peter  Jurs,overall good professor but the class is alot of work and difficult to know him other than at the huge lectures
1197,Peter  Jurs,the average on the final was a all i have to say
1198,Peter  Jurs,he was awesome
1199,Peter  Jurs,tough tests but he was easy to follow in lectures
1200,Peter  Jurs,not the most motivating guy in the world but what can you expect in a class of
1201,Peter  Jurs,i was really struggling in this course and he was very unwilling to help me
1202,Peter  Jurs,a hard course but a good prof
1203,Ryan  Stark,the best english professor i have had here at penn state classes are creative and stimulating i always leave thinking how i can improve my writing style very encouraging and works more towards developing your writing style rather than merely a critique highly recommend
1204,Ryan  Stark,ryan is the best professor had so far his class is very intellectually stimulating and very very fun we write essays with a focus on technique and style not content he made all of us better and more engaging writers i wish i could take this class again
1205,Ryan  Stark,if you have to take english take ryan he is hilarious and the class discussions are so good and any activity you do in class is creative and fun he teaches you to be a good nontextbooky type of writer best english teacher i have ever had i was a better writer for sure once i left his class
1206,Ryan  Stark,ryan stark may possibly be my favorite teacher of all time he encourages you to actually think for yourself and explore your writing he lets you do rewrites but only to benefit your writing favorite class in college so far i loved him
1207,Ryan  Stark,highlight of my week hilarious man who creates a fun atmosphere easy a but more importantly allows you to write about things that actually interest you kids came even when the classes were optional great time great teacher
1208,Ryan  Stark,best professor ever
1209,Ryan  Stark,sweetest class ever a mad nice teacher you get to redo every paper he grades if you choose only way to loose ur grade is if you go so attendance mandatory but you should go if you want an a and not a b funny class in a weird way but well worth time
1210,Ryan  Stark,very nice guy weird at times but funny in a corny way he lets you revise all your papers so you basically get which will boost your grade he is a very good teacher
1211,Ryan  Stark,really funny makes you want to go to class sort of a tough grader but he lets you revise all of your papers so you have second chances and he will be around to help you
1212,Ryan  Stark,ryan stark so many words for ryan stark take the class ignore your first impression of him i think a swell guy although seen him like four times between and am wearing flannel super funny surprisingly a difficult grader but are revisions
1213,Ryan  Stark,this teacher is smart and fun if a bit wacky keep you guessing which will keep you interested something good for a subject that can be a bit dull he encourages discussion and seems to actually care what his students have to say though get off track a lot there will be a point somewhere not just rambling about himself
1214,Ryan  Stark,greatest professor ever possibly
1215,Ryan  Stark,so awesome
1216,Ryan  Stark,ryan is great he makes writing fun and so cute
1217,Ryan  Stark,this was a senior seminar class that i was not excited about but it wa awesome mainly because of professor stark
1218,Ryan  Stark,awesome
1219,Ryan  Stark,i love this man quirky and makes class fun class discussions are often irrelevant but fun the work load is the easiest ive ever had and its supposed to be an honors course i love it
1220,Ryan  Stark,very good
1221,Ryan  Stark,an awesome guy since you absolutely have to take eng take it with ryan class discussions are interesting not a lot of work and he makes the class a lot less irritating than some other teachers
1222,Ryan  Stark,awesome awesome
1223,Ashraf  Shirani,this is a terrible professor who does not care about his students his homework assignment instructions are vague and if you write a wrong code but has the same output he will show no mercy he does not explain things well but expects you to retain the information anyway i do not know how he is still a professor here at sjsu worst experience
1224,Ashraf  Shirani,the subject material and the teaching style is boring but he does care about his students there are only homework assignments that add up to of your grade the rest is midterm and final he curved both the midterm and final by so many people were able to pass the class you would have to try hard to fail his course
1225,Ashraf  Shirani,while this subject can be a bit dry all resources and lectures are posted online it is an advanced course with an applied version of sql on the midterm and knowledge on terms with the final most of the class is structured so that while you have the resources you learn how to actually apply the concepts
1226,Ashraf  Shirani,very boring lectures professor lectures while most of class pay attention low attendance as semester goes on if you have to take this class it is not hard as it consists of hw assignments plus ec hw midterms finals and easy group project do well on hw as it worth significant part of grade also you get page of notes on tests
1227,Ashraf  Shirani,mr shirani is one of the few teachers that gives out very helpful study guides so you know what to study for on the homeworks assignments throughout the sem no group projects for study the study guide and in class exercise and you will do a good cheat have too show up to class
1228,Ashraf  Shirani,lot of students wrote a negative review for saying that his lecture is dry but more like the topic is somewhat dry the professor definitely goes above and beyond the textbook and teaches useful programs that are currently used in the mis field really cares about his students hw is challenging and makes you think gives generous extra crdit
1229,Ashraf  Shirani,very dry lectures just show up and understand what he is saying all assignment are tutorials on database he is very easy going mid term final very easy grader class is on basic like triggers big data database sap hana and a little mongo db
1230,Ashraf  Shirani,extremely nice professor was not a bad class for how dry the material was allows one page of notes for exams would recommend him to others
1231,Ashraf  Shirani,dr exams are notorious for being difficult they are based on conceptual understanding so studying the night before is not suggested that said if you are having trouble understanding he will help you during office hours or over email he is one of the nicest professors you will have
1232,Ashraf  Shirani,written guidance on projects unclear did not grade all of the parts of the projects submitted even though they were mandatory for the project very little interaction with students post during course
1233,Ashraf  Shirani,he is horrible i should have gotten an a in his class and he tanked my a at the very last second based on a group project that he only graded half of he graded the word document but not the required powerpoint presentation beware he is not a far professor
1234,Ashraf  Shirani,remember to bring your laptop you will watch over half the class surf facebook during his lecture this class is very important but its so boring a lot of people say nice but how he is to everybody until you cross him smile at you and tell you to read the book a students will get bs good luck staying awake
1235,Ashraf  Shirani,his zeal and compassion to better not only his students but anyone around him is unmatched it more than an honor to have him as a professor coach and approachable subject matter expert hence i am without a doubt fully confident to recommend him as a genuine mentor and leader in mis business intelligence and database
1236,Ashraf  Shirani,dr shirani is a great professor he is very supportive of students you need the textbook and you need a clear understanding of the concepts his questions go beyond understanding of terms if lazy do everyone a favor and drop the course really rude to play games on your laptop during lecture this is college
1237,Ashraf  Shirani,boring teacher he reads off of power point slides monotonously for the lectures of your grade is based on two tests which you will have no shot on if you study like never studied before i liked the content of the class and you will gain valuable skills that will look great on your resume oracle mostly
1238,Ashraf  Shirani,negative ratings for prof shirani are unjustified he is extremely nice he even have a huge curves on midterm final lectures can be boring but if you pay attention the concept is crystal clear no project few hw assignment and it no quizzes mis major you have alternative choice just show up and decide for yourself
1239,Ashraf  Shirani,a nice person but is a horrible professor super boring not clear ppl in class were so bored most of them were online chatting u basically teach urself the material since his poor teaching skills lead to poor grades he gives huge curves which still only lead to mostly after the curve i feel sorry for u if u take this with him
1240,Ashraf  Shirani,prof shirani is by far the best professor had at sjsu this is the first time i bother commenting on a professor because i feel that most of the comments here for prof shirani justifiable he is always willing to help his students those that do not pass his class with a good grade probably bother to try the exams are significa
1241,Ashraf  Shirani,dr shirani understands the field and illustrates his professionalism in class both the midterm and final are extremely challenging for being mcq tricky yet are easy for he specifies the material to study though he has a passive personality he cares about students learning and is approachable read the book and practice sql
1242,Ashraf  Shirani,he is the worst teacher i have ever taken at sjsu only midterm a final hw assign a lab and it before the final you only completed of the class unfortunately he is the only person teaching this class i learned nothing from him this semester better off skipping class and learning the material on your own
1243,Martha  Browne,one word nightmare
1244,Martha  Browne,i do not recommend her at all i would avoid her as much as possible treats you like a high school student poor time management skills she got many problem wrong in from of the class in a row does not know material copies straight from book
1245,Martha  Browne,avoid at all costs because she does not use canvas and will never tell you what your grade is because she also teaches high school and uses that as an excuse
1246,Martha  Browne,the worst professor ever had at pcc she basically copies the textbook to the board and she calls that a lecture she even able to answer any questions it really made me wonder why i was in that class i do not recommend you to take her even if you are good at math her class will bore you to death
1247,Martha  Browne,okay so i am going to start with the good things because this professor a terrible person just really tough she stops for questions students have her grading is really tough though on tests she deducts many points for small mistakes even for handwriting if math your thing its going to be tough homework is worth almost nothing
1248,Martha  Browne,never ever ever ever take her im in class right now we just got another test and more than half the class failed she teach well but she grades you work even worse she will take all your points for the dumbest reason
1249,Martha  Browne,the material we learn is definitely not hard she is a nice and some what a humorous teacher she has helpful methods there are a few things i would say she is very picky on how she wants the homework done it is graded based on correct answers you are not allowed a calculator and she kinda gets frustrated when you interrupt to ask a question
1250,Martha  Browne,a nice person gives her time to students who utilizes office hours hard coursework and a lot of homework but doing it really helps with the exam pick if you can allot enough time for it
1251,Martha  Browne,avoid at all costs nice person terrible teacher going to barely pass most of my classmates have to retake next semester only copies problems from the books and gets irritated when was stopped to explain the steps i spent a lot of time teaching myself from the book her grading system is very arbitrary too
1252,Martha  Browne,do yourself a favor and do not take her class only take her if you are really good in math otherwise have a really hard time struggling very difficult to understand and not that helpful her lectures are tedious i usually write reviews but i felt obligated to for this professor because she the worst professor had at pcc
1253,Martha  Browne,too bad
1254,Martha  Browne,she is the worst professor that ever had at pcc she even answer your questions all she does is copy the textbook on the board her lecture is extremely boring avoid her if possible
1255,Martha  Browne,do hw it will help you to study for the exam
1256,Martha  Browne,i dislike professor browne as a person but as a teacher she is very difficult to follow along with if you have trouble in math i would not recommend taking her class too much lecture without the in class practice if for some reason you do take her talk to her oneonone because she is willing to help you
1257,Martha  Browne,not a good professor she makes the easiest problems harder than they already look also she deducts way too many points from homework and tests for a simple mistake take her at your own risk
1258,Martha  Browne,on the first day of class she stated she was not a statistician she literally only writes definitions on the board and nothing else she likes to repeat how much she doesnt know about stats and that she only knows math not really worth taking the class unless you dont want to learn how to calculate the actual stats
1259,Martha  Browne,it was a complete surprise to me on the first day of class basically she is the human version of the textbook she really know statistics and even admitted that most of the time be writing stuff on the board writing down formulas and doing example problems half the time i understand the purpose behind it
1260,Martha  Browne,her class is hard you must do homework showup for class but she is very helpful knows what talking about i would say her class is for selfstarters who need little guidance tests are good if you did h.w asked questions when needed people who fail her class do the h.w or ask clarifying questions
1261,Martha  Browne,continuing my review from the one the other comments seem ridiculous her looks matter about how she can help you if you are not afraid to ask for help take her she push you away she does have a little tardy issue but that just means you can be a little late yourself i wish she was teaching this semester
1262,Martha  Browne,you have to give up to not pass.she is very willing to help you unless you are always absent act like you could care less.she will answer your sometimes right before the tests students could write a problem on the board from the study guide i got a b i never did word too more about your test grade
1263,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,one of the worst teachers i had at cca
1264,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,swisseducated background challenges the dominant cca graphic design philosophy that been perpetuated by groupthink students who embrace her method of teaching typography will benefit tremendously from a pedagogy that is rarely found on the west coast and enriches otherwise onenote graphic design curriculum we are lucky to have her
1265,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,this instructor is slightly insane but i think in a good way you will have so much homework you want to die but she is fair about giving extensions and cares deeply about teaching and the subject matter you will learn a lot
1266,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,teacher was so focused on getting assignments completed that she ignored the needs of the students creating a negative learning environment she often would not allow breaks would teach during lunch and assigned more homework then possible leaving students tired and stressed take another teacher if possible
1267,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,created a hostile class environment sarcastic about our work very negative experience
1268,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,definitely plays favorites she sure sees the weaknesses and keeps reminding you without telling you what to do about it get anything out of her class cuz she know how to teach i also saw how she was with esl students very mean and unhelpful
1269,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,the class is pretty hard but a very very good teacher she could see the strength and weaknesses of students she helps students to understand the fields of typography really learn alot from her class
1270,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,jean is a great professor the class was hard and a lot of work but i learned a lot i think i wasted more than a ream of paper drawing letters but what it takes some people think she has favorites i t know if true but if you work hard and show interest like you
1271,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,oh cry cry cry if you work hard for jean she sees that the grade is not the point anyway open your eyes jean is an excellent teacher the people who like jean try to get by on mediocar work and expect to get an a for just completing the assignment
1272,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,didnt end up learn grade people not their work.i tried to hand in the same work from my friend but she graded f to me.also i am a esl and she was not helpful to explain assignment in a good temper way why you read the handout one more time before asking question
1273,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,fun teacher who teaches students how to letter space rag and lead from a swiss basel manner she is not as bad as people say i did not get a good grade in her class i am saying this because she not as bad as people say she is but not super spectacular.butshecaresaboutherstudentsnotlikepatbrunin
1274,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,nightmare emotionaly unstable clueless makes class a stressfull and intolerant environment full of anxiety and fear
1275,Jean  Craig-Teerlink,totally fake and inhuman she kills the subject
1276,Donna  Chambers,awesome very helpful and organized kind person so be afraid to ask for help always looking out for her students knows what doing
1277,Donna  Chambers,she is one of the best professors i think she really knows what she is doing and you can tell she is definitely interested in her work very nice to students and is funny keeps you involved lecture all class so it moves fast very clear as to on tests and is helpful i went from a c in class to a bt in her
1278,Donna  Chambers,soo nice really cares about what the students have to say and soo helpful and understanding her passion for what she teachers makes you interested in the subject even if you before the class def recommend her take her if you get the chance she awesome
1279,Donna  Chambers,she is the nicest teacher en so helpful and happy her classes are never boring she is always prepared you should def take her
1280,Donna  Chambers,had her for and liked her everything you do counts for grade in that class making it easy online assignments are easy very nice and helpful come to class do homework hard not to do well in the class best span prof ever had
1281,Donna  Chambers,everything a professor should be so easy so clear on presentations you could basically have never taken high school spanish and you would be completely fine homework is easy and tests are straightforward it would be harder to fail the class than to pass it take her
1282,Donna  Chambers,soo easy her tests are a breeze and she only includes the easiet stuff in the chapters take her if you can for an easy a
1283,Donna  Chambers,she is soo nice lots of homework but its easy tests are so easy especially if you have had prior spanish experiance makes class as fun as possible

1291,Kathy  Brooks,awesome teacher
1292,Kathy  Brooks,no comments
1293,Kathy  Brooks,very good teacher good sense of humor very smart
1294,Tom  Johnson,a smart guy and loves technology most people his age are technophobes so good he knows how to use a computer his online tests are nice because you can retake them as many times as you want untill you get except the last test the final but soo borring never fallen asleep in a class until i took his class in fall of you can learn some good stuff if you pay attention and a big if very dry and borring class to hard though
1295,Tom  Johnson,listen folks the guy has to teach uninterested students and he is obviously a tech nerd i spent quite a bit of time talking to him outside of class and found him more than helpful and personable if you want a good grade do what it takes
1296,Tom  Johnson,no comments
1297,Tom  Johnson,i changed my major after taking him
1298,Tom  Johnson,worst professor i ever had.he is rude and is not a good teacher if you can avoid is class do so i dont care how long his resume is that mean he can teach
1299,Tom  Johnson,probably the most boreing class i have ever had to sit through if it wasnt for his weekly quizes on bs i would have never gone avoid at all costs
1300,Tom  Johnson,loves like they proved his teaching skills is ill tempered and generally just annoying avoid if you can especially for reporting
1301,Tom  Johnson,he may have a long resume but that does not mean he knows how to teach in fact he was one of the worst professors of my college career not because he was hard but because he was so inept at teaching the subject in addition he was short tempered and rude during one of our midterms he sat in the
1302,Tom  Johnson,boring class felt like i did not learn much hard grader when it comes to papers expects us to be knowledgeable reporters who know their stuff when we never been reporters in our lives too much expectation made it difficult not that good of a teacher very tough
1303,Tom  Johnson,this prof is soo boring this course is basically an intro kind of course in journalism but he treats students as if experienced reporters this class also has tons of readings online quizzes on very random topics found in the ny times everything is powerpount very impersonable
1304,Tom  Johnson,very hard course you can learn a lot but not helpful easy or clear in what he wants from his students you feel as though your never work improve but tough it out and get through it take someone else if you expect an easy course but take johnson if you want to learn
1305,Tom  Johnson,every class is a power point lecture it was painful weekly quizes based on reading lecture and any newspaper story he felt like hard grader too most people dropped the class not very personable or considerate as a teacher
1306,Tom  Johnson,i enjoyed the class even though at times it was painful trying to keep my eyes open but i learned a lot about journalism and how it is changing through the use of technology
1307,Tom  Johnson,hard very impersonal feel like failing for at least the first month you learn a lot but there are better professors in this department
1308,Tom  Johnson,mr johnson is very knowledgable about journalism and seems very smart but his class is extremely boring all he does is lecture and give power point presentations every single class the information presented is so boring and i think very useful
1309,Tom  Johnson,extremely knowledgable you will learn twice as much with johnson as you would in the same class with diff professor take johnson if you want to be a good journalist not if you are looking for ease
1310,Tom  Johnson,one word boring that describes both him and the class his lectures are the most boring thing i have ever experienced in my life i stopped going after the first few i recommend it if you like classes that are mostly online though
1311,Tom  Johnson,this guy knows how to stretch out his resume but does know how to teach
1312,Tom  Johnson,a total bore he has a powerpoint presentation for everything wanna know the history of the magazine powerpoint presentation send an email powerpoint presentation chew gum while walking powerpoint presentation still smart and a
1313,Tom  Johnson,incourages students to learn technology could do journalism with his eyes closed
1314,John  Moliassa,hes alright but the hype is really unjustified his rating should be around lectures are out of the book and homework problems are obviously way different than the generic book examples weekly quizzes on the unit circle got old after awhile when one little mistake could cause a not a bad guy though
1315,John  Moliassa,best professor i loved math class with mr moliassa he explains the curriculum pretty well and always available if you need help especially if you show him you care about doing well in the course he will do his best to help you be prepared to work though you regret taking math class with him
1316,John  Moliassa,am actually shocked at how high of a rating he has homework is due every week and is only worth of the grade while the tests are worst and are way harder than homework also very confusing to follow and he goes so fast not the best if you arent strong in math for sure
1317,John  Moliassa,tests are near impossible to finish and account for most of grade does not grade on a curve only covers examples exactly as written in textbook the tests and quizzes are in a completely different format than homework alot of homework assigned for very little of grade most will struggle with him unless you already know subject well
1318,John  Moliassa,best math teacher i have ever had he taught math is a way i could understand and always available for help had office hours before class i would stop in every morning to ask questions either on homework or take home quizzes helps you on quizzes or offers you to redo tests for credit builds relationships with students funny and is awesome
1319,John  Moliassa,this professor is awesome if you show him that you care he will help you raise your grade make sure to do your homework and and go to his office before you submit a quiz and after you submit in exam this will guarantee you to get a higher grade you will not regret taking this course with him the best
1320,John  Moliassa,you will not regret taking a class with him i have always struggled with math and thought calc would be impossible for me but he made it understandable very funny cares about students and makes a lecture for a very boring subject interesting the textbook for this class is very complicated so expect to pass easily if you show
1321,John  Moliassa,made class more enjoyable and made a rather complicated subject understandable has available office hours before class and is always willing to help he is also one of the goofiest and funniest professors had
1322,John  Moliassa,best professor ever had i normally dread math class and do poorly in the class but this was the one exception as long as you attend class take notes and make sure you do your homework this class will be fairly easy mr moliassa is an excellent professor funny and easy to listen to and is always available to help
1323,John  Moliassa,very good at explaining complicated concepts in a simple way and is helpful if you reach out to him but his tests are impossible the calc class i took was an hour and mins and he requires his tests to be completed during class period the tests are very long and if you go over time he deducts points because of this i am failing
1324,John  Moliassa,moliassa is a really odd guy he gets a little too enthusiastic about math a good guy though and really helpful good at making difficult topics easy to understand going to class is necessary to passing
1325,John  Moliassa,this class felt like my high school math classes you have homework assigned every night but not a lot if you need help he loves to help kind of a goofy guy so the class is a little bit more enjoyable for a math class i would recommend him to anyone
1326,John  Moliassa,great teacher i am terrible at math and bombed the first exam mr moliassa worked with me through out the semester and i ended up with a good grade in the class attend classes give up on this class
1327,John  Moliassa,do not take him if you struggle in math funny but moves quickly and erases board to fast do hw and quizzes they will help your grade if you struggle with the tests
1328,John  Moliassa,moliassa is a hilarious makes math fun he often came to class with chalk all over his face always said good morning even though it was evening he was very helpful and clarified a lot of topics for me after having moliassa for precalc i became so interested in math that i ended up taking calculus even though not required for my degree
1329,John  Moliassa,explains clearly gives time to practice examples in class.very organized and thorough expects some prior knowledge but will walk you through when needed.do the homework he gives without checking each answer.gives study guides for exams go to classhe gives test questions when only a few people show up funny knowledgable and passionate
1330,John  Moliassa,good professor math is not an easy subject for me and i ended up getting a b in the class definitely make sure he knows who you are and that you actually care about getting a good grade it will help you in the end going into his office for help is definitely worth it
1331,John  Moliassa,overall a good professor probably the best that teaches my only complaints are that he moves pretty fast when doing problems on the board and erases his work from the board pretty fast he does help students a lot in his office but he seems to get frustrated easily overall good professor though i would recommend him
1332,John  Moliassa,amazing professor
1333,John  Moliassa,this class was pretty hard he did his best to teach it and knew what he was talking about but many students were lost he also got annoyed when people would ask questions during class overall it was decent
1334,Roger  Strong,he will kick your butt and you will thank him for it our class went from students to less than by midterms read his powerpoints as he leaves clues as to what he will test on listen to his advice and study at least hours a week make your own study guides you have to put in the effort but he will work with you to help you succeed
1335,Roger  Strong,this man is and tries to use example in everyday life strong is very disorganized we ended up using lab time for lecture time often and missed material not included in our books and when it came to exam lot of material was indeed not covered if be directed to the search engine
1336,Roger  Strong,professor strong is a really good professor class easy and you will have to study take good notes and maybe even watch a couple of videos in order to really understand the material expected to know on exams mr strong does tutor after class or before in groups if needed to prepare for exams no quizzes no homework studying is hw
1337,Roger  Strong,professor strong is an awesome teacher he teaches the science and relates it all to real life if you stick with him he eases up towards the end of the semester he is knowledgeable and wise he is always willing to stay after class to help and even held a study group on a saturday morning before finals the best take him if you can
1338,Roger  Strong,professor strong wants you to learn the material so he will make you work for your grade if you take your education seriously and expect to have your grade handed to you take this class this class taught me how to study for a test without memorizing general information truly one of my favorites
1339,Roger  Strong,i was worried when i decided to take this teacher this is not an easy class the teacher is wonderful and takes time to explain the material if you hope to pass without studying this is not the class for you if you like to learn from somebody who knows i recommend this teacher he is absolutely one of the best you have to work very hard
1340,Roger  Strong,prof strong is extremely energetic makes sure everyone is participating throughout labs and lectures if you put in the effort he will do the same skipping a class the best idea he does move quick but the book and powerpoint do help he makes all of his tests and makes every question critical thinking really tough
1341,Roger  Strong,prof strong is an okay professor i found his lectures i basically taught myself by reading the chapters going over the ppts and creating my own study guides his tests are tough study everything if you ask for help he is willing to help though lab practicals are easy if you study and go to the tutoring center
1342,Roger  Strong,he is a hard grader but he wants you to know the subject not just memorize it to pass the test if looking for an easy class this is not for you you will have to try really hard to make an a he does not curve give extra credit or make things easier for you
1343,Roger  Strong,strong was one of my most favorite teachers about half of my class dropped but i feel it was due to laziness if you are not a lazy student and you put the time in you can guarantee an a or a b i had a month old baby a job and took this class i worked my butt off and made a b with a lot of help from mr strong he is an amazing teacher
1344,Roger  Strong,run i mean you want to pass with a decent grade do not take him i have taken i have a massage license and i am dropping mid semester nearly my whole class is failing in which he takes no blame his tests are personally made and make sense compared to the lecture take someone else
1345,Roger  Strong,the most accurate review read of this prof is the one below me rest are exaggerating yes tough but do you really think nursing school is easy sorry to say heck no and about the accent really if normal human can make it through his class everyone can not hard to understand him he teaches excellent and is a doctor himself
1346,Roger  Strong,prof strong really cares about you yes his tests are difficult but coming from a former professor from ut health what do you expect he trains you for nursing school because keep in mind nursing school is not easy i recommend taking him if you can accept the challenge because in the long run you will learn an awful amount
1347,Roger  Strong,a good teacher but there enough time to study for that much information when you have family and kids really critical on studying and test what you think you really know where the exam is coming from he give reviews or study guides
1348,Roger  Strong,its very hard to understand him he wont give you reviews for any exam not very helpful please buy hes book we even use it and its very expensive
1349,Roger  Strong,apart from his hard to understand jamaican accent he tends to skip topics and trick you on test for ex on one exam multiple choice he tell us that there was more than one answer so while grading he mentioned it and most of the class pass really btw no extra credit no reviews given beware of this professor it is not helpful
1350,Roger  Strong,still in the semester tough so far but a lot i have already learned def a challenging class but what you put in you will get out
1351,Roger  Strong,i speak for all when i say this professor is just amazing on my point of view he is not only a professor but also an advisor who wishes nothing more than the best in your career
1352,Roger  Strong,professor strong is a good man who genuinely cares about hes students the test are hard because he doesnt want students to memorize the material but to understand how it works he get nicer as the semester progress so dont give up quickly for example he starts giving reviews for test broad reviews but they do help if you do the work study hard and come to class theres no need to worry
1353,Roger  Strong,not a class for people who want to work if you want to sleep through class or expect him to give away grades choose a class that you can pass without learning he will explain concepts over and over until everyone understands take him if you want to succeed in nursing
1354,Carl  Pratt,timely on grading he made the subject interesting and used thought provoking questions and great examples i would look for this teacher for future classes
1355,Carl  Pratt,i took him for biolab i was scared because i have never had a science lab before it ended up being a great time he is fun and helpful the lab was pretty easy
1356,Carl  Pratt,can earn an a if you do the work there is a decent amount to do but not too difficult very thorough comments in assignments fast turnaround when grading
1357,Carl  Pratt,online class his is very ccear with requirements this class is not a soft class but is not extreme this class can be done while taking other accel classes
1358,Carl  Pratt,great teacher very direct and tells you up front what he likes and dislikes learned a lot in class
1359,Carl  Pratt,i got great grades but learn a darn thing surely paying for it now in my career
1360,Carl  Pratt,labs were ok not hard but not boring either always kept me busy
1361,Carl  Pratt,no comments
1362,Carl  Pratt,hate science he made me love it very interesting class
1363,Carl  Pratt,very cool fun interesting
1364,Mary  Winn,run far away i repeat do not take it she was aware her entire class was full of nursing majors and were forced to take this class for our core classes and made sure she made it as difficult as possible her lectures are dragged on and she talks about the same topic for minutes also the power points do not help they are literally slides
1365,Mary  Winn,think twice before taking this class with her she is nice but when grading her papers and the exams is the opposite
1366,Mary  Winn,winn is clearly a professor who knows her material her course is not too hard but not to easy you definitely earn the grade given very fair and very helpful if lost with the material help without hesitation
1367,Mary  Winn,professor winn is an excellent instructor.there are times when she is unclear however when asked prof winn will explain until it becomes clear she also encouraged questions and was very open with after class help if you needed it she is very enthused about the material which made her a joy to be around
1368,Mary  Winn,study study and study the text book and do the sample question she give quizzes with max question the questions can have part anwers to it she does not curve she teaches from powerpoints and the last half hour of class are sample problems for the upcoming test she knows her class is hard again study everything she gives you
1369,Mary  Winn,very hard and she knows it she explains the first class in order to pass her test you must study note power pt and read text book the test questions arent study terms and definitions they are how to connect terms if you take this corse good luck i got a c
1370,Mary  Winn,her tests are indeed hard and inconsistent with anything in lectures take if you are willing to read or more pages a night and somehow retain random knowledge for the tests otherwise avoid she is very knowledgeable however and very friendly not a terrible teacher but her tests are really really hard
1371,Mary  Winn,her tests are impossible very boring class her powerpoints are pointless they help you at all take her if you can help it run awayy
1372,Mary  Winn,enjoyed class and learne so much you get out of it what you put in to it you will not fail her course if you read and study i struggled through her course and earned a a and no it was not easy but it was well worthy it i feel ready for grad school if you are looking for and easy a cake walk class this is not the professor for you
1373,Mary  Winn,very nice but not a very good teacher does a powerpoint for every class and reads from it exams every two weeks that are impossible to pass there are questions on each exam and even after reading the book and studying the powerpoints still failed the material is difficult and the exams impossible
1374,Mary  Winn,she is a very nice lady and that is the only nice thing i could find to say her lectures are not have nothing to do what is on her test do not depend on your notes or her notes they help you you must read the book a least times the test come directly from the book do not depend on a review she give one take her
1375,Mary  Winn,she is a very interesting teacher she does weird demo remembering her fire alarm scream but she explains things pretty well she gives exams but will be drop mostly multiple choice that can be study from book one paper easy class but can be boring from time to time when she talks
1376,Mary  Winn,very very boring class
1377,Mary  Winn,run very far away
1378,Mary  Winn,she isnt that bad of a teacher you def have to read the book because she doesnt go over everything in class the tests r ok just have to study hard easy grader on papers and tends to scream bark and kick when she does demonstrations a lil wierd
1379,Mary  Winn,not as bad as people think i have no attention span tests r multiple choice and you should read but i havent and i got a c papers arent to bad and there arent many it could be worse
1380,Mary  Winn,a nice lady start studying for the tests now if you study alot and take good notes succeed and dont for get to show up and participate
1381,Mary  Winn,she is a great person with a lot of enthusiasm for psych i remember liking her classes
1382,Mary  Winn,amazingly insightful professor know in the minority here but i loved her lectures take notes know your material ask her any questions you may have and be set
1383,Mary  Winn,exams are impossible entirely too much for an intro class exams is dropped but let that fool you notes essential to get anything above a d or c you must thoroughly read the book many hours of studying book is terrible very long reads per chapter take if not a psychology major
1384,Deidre  Condit,love this professor a little disorganized but not too bad because super lenient on assignments and always very helpful so passionate about the material which really engages you she is the type of professor you will remember years down the road when you look back at your education take this professor learn a lot
1385,Deidre  Condit,the prof was missing in action the entire semester she seldom interacted with students maybe teaching is a low priority
1386,Deidre  Condit,probably one of the best educational experiences ever had i wanted to applaud after every lecture great teacher if you actually give a crap about trying to learn the material
1387,Deidre  Condit,great teacher great lecturer you can tell she lives and breathes the material which is pretty inspiring loved her class too bad she teach political theory on the regular
1388,Deidre  Condit,anyone seriously interested in political theory should take dr condit her class intellectually challenged me more than any other i do wish however that she had been more clear about which readings we would be tested on both the reading scheduled and study guides she posted would have assigned readings that just show up on the tests
1389,Deidre  Condit,she is a fantastic prof the individual who questioned her commitment to her online course has obviously never gone in during her office hours so helpful and caring if you are going to rate a college prof you should probably spell check your submission so that it seems as if you actually have the intellect required to pass a college course
1390,Deidre  Condit,dr condit is the worst online professor ever had at vcu she took on a new chair role in the poli sci department and very obviously handle that and teaching go weeks without hearing from her and never has anything up on time ne i understand busy but being mia from her students is completely unacceptable
1391,Deidre  Condit,she was the knees
1392,Deidre  Condit,a conservative grassroots activist and i expected the worst walking into a condit class there are rumors her class challenged me intellectually more than any other class had at vcu were this a sword battle i would bow and compliment her on a wellfought engagement take condit especially if conservative
1393,Deidre  Condit,ridiculously rambling lectures made it halfway through the syllabus by the end of the semester and instead talked about her passions of feminism and hating children tests are all multiple choice and draw from the lectures the class is easy and she curves everything just know that every lecture you go to is going to feel like five hours
1394,Deidre  Condit,if you have not taken a condit class you are crazy she is an amazing person helpful and understanding however her class is not structed by any means very inconsistent with due dates and assignments class discussions are great and will always keep you interested she really makes you think oh be prepared for a group project
1395,Deidre  Condit,very nice lady tends to not describe all topics very clearly and tends to go off on tangents about feminism she is very opinionated and she wants it known chances are you will probably disagree with her at some point but she does make you learn she is also kind of flexible on grading i certainly did better than i thought i would
1396,Deidre  Condit,she is one of the greatest professors had so far she has a way of connecting real life with the things we have to learn in class to make everything interesting you have to do the reading otherwise fail the tests read and come to class and do fine
1397,Deidre  Condit,the initial meeting of her was deceitful very liberal and vocal about it in which opposite i thought i would hate the class but loved it very passionate about what she does and it shows she will open your mind for sure a great class to take because she truly is brilliant on this topic
1398,Deidre  Condit,i thought to myself upon entering her class wow she is a diehard liberal and i am not going to be happy however i would recommend her to everyone considering poli sci she will open your mind to things you previously have never thought of i can truly say she is brilliant a little scattered which hurt the class but brilliant
1399,Deidre  Condit,a really good teacher but her class can be boring sometimes i went like times in the whole semester and still got an a because i studied for her tests must do the readings very important
1400,Deidre  Condit,very fun class probably because it was a level though great discussions on the material and she did answer most questions students had tests hard either again being level class likely played a huge part in this as well
1401,Deidre  Condit,well and interesting woman for sure i took this class at the pinnacle of my first relationship i came to love women and myself as a woman i know i became more powerful inside myself and i learned to love others more fully my one qualm the class is a little i say take it but keep in mind humanity is okay
1402,Deidre  Condit,she never responds to emails its incredibly annoying and frustrating especially when she is grading your papers and is taking her merry time doing it
1403,Deidre  Condit,when the semester started i was really put off by dr condit but my opinion changed yes very liberal and yes she can be too vocal about that however she has excellent insight into general concepts of politics and the discussions are valuable also probably the only professor had at vcu who really cares about her students
1404,Marlos  Scrimger,marlos is a great instructor she has a wealth of knowledge and i always learn a lot in all of the classes i take with her the friendliest professor in the department
1405,Marlos  Scrimger,ok teacher read labs before class and try to do assignments or they will take up the whole lab adds stuff to test that she talks about that found in the book or on the lab so take notes seems very knowledgeable on subject matter as well as enthusiastic about teaching failed to stop disruptive talking during her lecture
1406,Marlos  Scrimger,hard unorganized exams were terrible labs were time consuming not worth your time or effort
1407,Marlos  Scrimger,really a nice woman i care for the amount of work to do in lab that was worth very little points she is very helpful though
1408,Marlos  Scrimger,i liked her but i struggled a little in her class at times her lecture was hard to follow but there was time in class for her to help the students privately which she was more than willing to do
1409,Marlos  Scrimger,great and interesting class marlos clearly enjoys the material great hazard movies must actually read the book though
1410,Marlos  Scrimger,marlos is full of knowledge and experience she seems to know a lot about the subject and seems to like input advice presentations due at different times some people get weeks to write it others get months choose smart there are a lot of movies and you have to pay attention you will be tested on them
1411,Marlos  Scrimger,positive attitude
1412,Marlos  Scrimger,good prof but remember everything she says in lab because it will be on the exam very helpful
1413,Marlos  Scrimger,one of the best professors i have had always willing to talk to you and answer your questions must pay attention in class to get a good grade on the tests overall take her class if you can
1414,Marlos  Scrimger,a bit speedy in presenting material but always willing to help also a fair grader
1415,Marlos  Scrimger,very good prof puts things clearly and makes the class interesting and easy to follow if you can i would suggest taking her
1416,Marlos  Scrimger,great intructor easy going and personable she does explain things very well and i found her very helpful tests are difficult but fair so know your stuff and you will do fine
1417,Marlos  Scrimger,doesnt explain very well was offended when asked to spend more time on topics
1418,Marlos  Scrimger,i had her for lab the assignments were reasonable but the tests were really hard there were a lot of formulas you needed to memorize in order to know how to do charts etc
1419,Marlos  Scrimger,great professor clear on what she wants from you i enjoyed going to the class it was an interesting class you should take it with her if you can environmental hazards and natural disasters
1420,Marlos  Scrimger,she was great always there to help test can be very hard though study study study
1421,Marlos  Scrimger,good at explaining the labs even if the material is a little difficult i think over all pretty good
1422,Marlos  Scrimger,be warned everything i mean everything she covers in class is on the exams
1423,Marlos  Scrimger,her lab i found to be extremely difficult she does well lecturing but it was difficult to get her help on the lab at times she really care to help you understand the terms study the rocks for the final
1424,Thomas  Cooke,i enjoyed this class modules and you get weeks for each one a few assignments a blog post and a quiz each module totally doable amount of work only thing is for the blog you need to work with your group and a lot of people wait until the last minute cooke was very helpful and informative either way highly recommended
1425,Thomas  Cooke,geog online and it was a fair amount of work the problem is that his quizzes are not reflected by the material learned there would be a or mc that had a graded answer different from what the book said so that was not fair also he did not give feedback on why you got the grades you did on discussion posts and essay questions
1426,Thomas  Cooke,this was my second class with prof cooke and i say he was much more organized than the first time prof cooke means well and is a nice guy but he just seems all over the place and not clear on his assignment requirements
1427,Thomas  Cooke,highly would not recommend taking a class with this individual his grading for exams is non existent and his as a professor is severely lacking to say the least
1428,Thomas  Cooke,professor cooke cares about the subject and the students but is extremely disorganized overall the lectures are interesting he is a harsh grader but curves the grades a lot the textbooks are completely unnecessary even though he made us buy four of them
1429,Thomas  Cooke,the materials covered in this class are informative and interesting and prof cooke is helpful too the only issue i have with the class is the opinionated questions on the quizzes
1430,Thomas  Cooke,i took dr urbn course online over the summer dr cooke is pretty knowledgable and it was an interesting course there was no textbook and he just had you do assigned readings on huskyct your grade was based on writing assignments and your comments on other assignments and he dropped your two lowest scores
1431,Thomas  Cooke,overall this class was petty no textbook and slides are posted online before class however you will still need to go to lecture in order for you to know his anecdotes or opinions that he often puts on the exam the material was not hard however it was not fun and can become time consuming cooke is a funny professor tho
1432,Thomas  Cooke,really care about the course asks terrible questions on the tests that are completely ambiguous asks questions on opinionated topics says curve final grades but for our class just a terrible course overall take it if you have to
1433,Thomas  Cooke,average and this class is going to bring it down very difficult exams do not take class
1434,Thomas  Cooke,tests are kinda hard but he cancelled the final and gave everyone a the lowest test grade out of four including the final was dropped so it essentially counted for a third of the grade
1435,Thomas  Cooke,he is an ok professor very nice but can ramble going to class is not necessary he posts all of the slides online before the lecture there are three exams the final third exam contains word for word questions from the first two so make sure you review those with the ta there is a generous curve on everything and extra credit offered
1436,Thomas  Cooke,the information in this class is pretty useless but all notes and readings are posted online so no need to go to class or buy a textbook he curves all the exams even when he says he and offered a short extra credit paper at the end of the class not the most helpful professor but easy overall
1437,Thomas  Cooke,sounds like a great teacher in the class room however online is the worst grading rubric in the world he gave me a for an assignment out of which i did complete in entirety not even one point for trying i would never recommend him for an online class
1438,Thomas  Cooke,urban studies really interest me but cooke is a good lecturer and an easy a
1439,Thomas  Cooke,i signed up for this cities course not expecting much out of it but it grew on me so much that i enjoyed coming in to class he makes it very interesting if you like history some funny jokes grading is quite easy exam questions are given beforehand so you can study for them i love how i learn most in classes that require much studying
1440,Thomas  Cooke,one of the best classes i have taken at uconn enjoyed the material and his teaching style only complaint is time granted on the tests overall great class
1441,Thomas  Cooke,great professor very funny and interesting the class grade is based on only exams he curves everything going to class and taking notes is very helpful
1442,Thomas  Cooke,i loved his class i definitely recommended taking his class
1443,Thomas  Cooke,i had cooke for a once a week class for population geography i thought that he was entertaining and kept the class relatively light considering some of the material only exams and a paper for grades i enjoyed the class and so long as you attended and took a few notes you will be prepared for the exams
1444,Lashun  Griffin,professor griffin is very rude she missed class at least three times for personal reasons which is fine life happens but lets hope it doesnt happen to you because she will give you an f for missed assignments no late turn ins she is unreasonable rude and unhappy i worked extremely hard and still for a d her grading is bias
1445,Lashun  Griffin,i took english and with ms griffin during my freshman year her classes are not easy but if interested in learning or are up for a challenge and ready to receive a lot of constructive criticism this is it i made a c in b in but after that i made nothing less than a in every paper i wrote throughout college
1446,Lashun  Griffin,the absolute worst professor i have ever taken i have had lots of professors i am a hard working student who cares about my grades she is and worst care at all about the student and just likes to give bad grades just for the fun of it also no structure in the classroom had to go to her boss just to fix my grade
1447,Lashun  Griffin,i was a first time freshman in college taking ms griffin and she was okay to start off but over time she became very annoying and rude she was out spoken and spoke to me like i was a child most of the time she steps out of her place a lot jokingly or not i wouldnt recommend to anyone
1448,Lashun  Griffin,dr griffin is a great person very funny and cares she barely teaches during lectures and your weekly work was online and would be due at weird times throughout the week she also had online quizzes and a couple extra credit papers at the end of the semester we had an apa research paper and a min vlog which was difficult very tough grader
1449,Lashun  Griffin,for any english majors or if you want a challenge to improve your english she is a perfect match she is a tough grader very detailed at the end of semester she had us do a vlog and research paper about a leader based on leadership so start on time she is a great person can be reasonable if you talk with her on time
1450,Lashun  Griffin,i did not understand her grading her lectures were poor so you learned nothing other than due a few office hours so pray god to catch her almost no extra credit till there was left from most of us are still failing good person though no teaching other than her leadership stuff you have to learn from cengage and book
1451,Lashun  Griffin,very goofy love her as a person but that matter she grades really tough and there are quizzes that are due in the middle of the day online like every week which she remind you about she cancel class but she will have another professor come in and sub for her
1452,Lashun  Griffin,i took professor griffin online one her quizzes are confusing she would have one part of the question mimic the book and then the second half of the question she adds her twist to it second her writing assignments she wants both the written portion of a paper and a vlog lecture she wants u come up to the school for writing papers
1453,Lashun  Griffin,she is a great teacher her classes are not easy but a nice way to challenge yourself she knows what she is talking about and she responds to your email rapidly beware she is very sassy and will roast the students who neither do the work or did it completely wrong from her instructions she gives a lot of grace
1454,Lashun  Griffin,a good professor overall but if looking to do nothing and get an a not for you a tough grader but is there to help if you ask adamant about class participation so call everyone out at some point her class easy and only those who really want to learn will stay my class count went from to about
1455,Lashun  Griffin,the most unreasonable professor i have ever taken she is extremely rude to her students and talks to them as if they are below her gives poor instructions and provide help responds to her students rudely and does not have a problem yelling at them very unprofessional she is in the wrong field if she is not passionate about teaching
1456,Lashun  Griffin,horrible grading
1457,Lashun  Griffin,ms lashun griffin is a really great teacher if you need help there to help you she does grade her papers tough but her comments and feedback would help you do better if you want to pass this course you cannot procrastinate on her class
1458,Lashun  Griffin,professor griffin is a fantastic english teacher she is very caring and yes she is a tough grader but she literally gives you step by step instructions on what she is requiring from you the class is difficult if you procrastinate and do not stay on top of your game i am taking her for my english
1459,Lashun  Griffin,i took mrs griffin during my first semester of college i know what i was getting myself into it was challenging she was very intimidating but she did help with giving good feedback on my papers we had to do like a midterm timed writing and a page paper as final and a presentation of you presenting your thesis that you wrote about
1460,Lashun  Griffin,i took this class online and regret it because eventually had to drop it you have to come into this class as a professional writer very stressful and makes you write a paper in a short time span not really clear on her instructions and expects you to already know do not take if english is not your best subject
1461,Lashun  Griffin,i absolutely loved this class she had such a huge impact on me and sure she even realize it she is a wonderful teacher and she makes sure that the students make her do her job leave this class until you understand here because of and for you wonderful professor taken for i would take her again
1462,Lashun  Griffin,i loved this class professor griffin was so fun and sassy it was not an easy class professor griffin believed in us and had high expectations i have fond memories of my semester with her
1463,Lashun  Griffin,professor griffin is not helpful at all her organization skills are very poor we missed two weeks of class because of her personal issues and we had no sub during that time she does not explain anything right might come up with rude comments tries too hard to be funny very confusing tough grader recommend to take her classes
1464,Ellis  Jones,a very unhelpful professor who prefers breaking up into groups four times in one class than actually teaching said during office hours that he does not give full credit at all he is highly knowledgeable but just a little odd man on a power trip
1465,Ellis  Jones,the best teacher sociology teacher i have ever had been through colleges universities in norcal and socal the best soc teacher for the person who says not really but he has every right to feel smug been through the peacecorp trying to open a nonprofit what the hell have you done for this world
1466,Ellis  Jones,amazing teacher that obviously loves what he does
1467,Ellis  Jones,one of my favorite teachers he always had the class laughing there is a lot of thinking and writing involved in this class but overallvery fun if you have to take soc take class you regret it
1468,Ellis  Jones,if you want to understand how our society works all the bad things that are going on and what we could do to stop them this is the class for you if you want a traditional and structured teaching style on what sociology is and does then you like this class
1469,Ellis  Jones,not only is dr jones super cute also a really good teacher he made me look at the things i did on a regular basis in a completely different light everyone should take him
1470,Ellis  Jones,a cool guy you really stress about the class
1471,Ellis  Jones,like his teaching style.i hate sitting in circles and having discussions especially when the people are all super against corporations and they get into these big tyrades about how bad they are.there was too much focus on it got to be quite annoying should have dropped
1472,Ellis  Jones,no comments
1473,Ellis  Jones,i been able to see the world the same since.i continue to use his written book for a conscious living guide.he is gifted with groups and is more interested in teaching reallife application to social problems than the technicalities of the field
1474,Ellis  Jones,you either like him or you think a strange little man he tries to make you think very wise but when you analyze deeper you see just a cocky knowitall if you like group in cicles and sharing feelings this is the class u
1475,Ellis  Jones,a very intresting class didnt know what to expect he is a very cool teacher is style of teaching is like no other teacher hey makes you do pretty fun activities you dont have test but must do the homework
1476,Ellis  Jones,his teaching style is super cool he is very warm and kind man
1477,Ellis  Jones,ellis is the best his open teaching techniques provide students with a exciting school experience this class is not another blah blah blah
1478,Ellis  Jones,the most interesting and intriguing class i have ever encountered at scc the assignments seem odd but if you actually do them you will explore new areas of yourself and your acquaintances that you wouldnt have come across otherwise
1479,Ellis  Jones,not the best teacher for actually learning the science of sociology but an amazingly fun and engaging class no tests but you cannot miss class once in a while or miss an assignment here and there and expect to get a decent grade highly reccomended
1480,Ellis  Jones,no comments
1481,Peter  Kuhlman,dr kuhlman is the best teacher in the chemistry department students will fight to get his class during registration he is very helpful outside of class and explains his logic very clearly however he places a lot of class percentage on tests
1482,Peter  Kuhlman,dr kuhlman is a great professor he is helpful willing to make time if you need assistance and is really clear on what he expects of you
1483,Peter  Kuhlman,he is a really great teacher and if you put effort into the class you will do well
1484,Peter  Kuhlman,extremely helpful professor he is very committed to his students and he is always there to offer his help he is the best professor ever i would take again and i highly recommend him
1485,Peter  Kuhlman,by far the best professor had the privilege to have at denison so enthusiastic about biochemistry and he will do whatever it takes to help you even if that requires him losing sleep his understanding and willingness to help really made me want to do well in this class if you get the chance take a class with him
1486,Peter  Kuhlman,dr kuhlman is probably one of the best professors at denison he is the nicest professor i have had here and will do everything in his power to make sure you understand what you need to know he even goes the extra mile and tries to help based on how you learn will take him again and maybe even another time after that
1487,Peter  Kuhlman,he was a wonderful professor very busy man because he is always willing to help people in his spare time he was also the head of the chem department he is one of my favorite professors class is a little difficult but he is so great at what he does that is not dreadful i highly recommend that you take any chemistry class you can with him
1488,Peter  Kuhlman,the most magnificent professor ever a genius he is dedicated to helping you out and is just excellent at his job his class may not be easy but he is willing to explain things and help you out as much as willing to be helped best professor at denison
1489,Peter  Kuhlman,fantastic helpful kind challenging inspiring and in one of his favorite words commendable lucky you to have this fabulous professor for chemistry
1490,Peter  Kuhlman,i signed up for his class at am first semester and realize how hellish waking up that early would be with my workload but when it came time for choosing my second semester chem class and the only available time with dr k was again i gladly signed up to have him as the professor
1491,Peter  Kuhlman,dr kuhlman is a fantastic professor he is chair of both the chemistry and biochemistry departments and so can provide fantastic examples for his teaching from both physical and life sciences he appear to sleep we receive emails from him at in the morning and then another at am he holds regular and on demand review sessions
1492,Peter  Kuhlman,this guy knows how to teach so busy as chair of the department but make time for you and amazing one on one if you like paper tests let you do an oral test and he really works with your needs fantastic please take a class with him a genius
1493,Peter  Kuhlman,excellent teacher he explains everything very clearly and keeps the class going at a manageable pace if you understand something he will work with you until you get it if really interested in something encourage you further in it
1494,Peter  Kuhlman,dr k is the best chem prof ever he gives a ton of extra credit opportunities very laid back pretty cool over all his class is much easier than any of the other classes at least for gen chem try to get his class
1495,Peter  Kuhlman,i love peter i could chemically make a baby with him i would best prof ever so understanding and is always there to help i wish he taught all my classes p.s check out the paint

1498,Vike,hiss class is hard but he is a good professor he is very clear when he lecures if you pay attention and come to class you will do well if you need his class just to fill a requirement then i would not recommd him because he does have an easy a class he is very good though
1499,Vike,no comments

1505,Desmond  Hamlet,i took him for an fys and i thought he was really funny his laugh is hysterical not an english major so he might be difficult he that hard for the fys
1506,Desmond  Hamlet,very entertaining load was a bear when i used cliff notes my grades were and when i i got
1507,Desmond  Hamlet,dr hamlet expected a lot but helped my writing calling him pompous formal unlike many denison but there for us when we need him if not lazy or clueless he responds to you
1508,Desmond  Hamlet,pompous professor with the most egotistical writing ever seen
1509,Desmond  Hamlet,i hope a better teacher than advisor after two years with him i walked in at the end of my junior year to ask about my thesis and he even know my name
1510,Desmond  Hamlet,you might hear about how loud his voice be fooled it keep you awake or even slightly interested in the class ego problem beware
1511,Desmond  Hamlet,hilarious makes himself laugh all the time funny anecdotes gives plenty of time to read material likes to hear himself talk a lecture class except on discussion days rewards you for saying what he wants to hear is occasionally impressed by original thinking only if brilliant
1512,Desmond  Hamlet,he was so unhelpful and his lectures were took up the entire class period
1513,Desmond  Hamlet,take him
1514,Desmond  Hamlet,bad
1515,Desmond  Hamlet,gone past being an abominable teacher the problem with professors who let their own power get to their heads watch out for his writing mark up everything on your papers btw like a misplaced comma etc and ask this lousy lousy bloated egotistical prof
1516,Desmond  Hamlet,trust the last few entries class changed my life and changed the way i read everything those who react badly to him must just be superficial or lazy
1517,Desmond  Hamlet,bad bad bad
1518,Desmond  Hamlet,boring lectures too much
1519,Desmond  Hamlet,professor ham is a disgrace to his profession he beats books to a pulp which is good if he allows the students to do the analyzing instead of ramming his own correct opinions down their throats he blabbers more than any sane man i know and he thinks god because he has a loud voice retire
1520,Desmond  Hamlet,hamlet was the worst english teacher i have ever had he is arrogant pompous and full of himself he assigns prompts that are purposely ambiguous so he can lord it over you when you do poorly hs writing indicates this if you can regurgitate what he says nod and swoon a lot then do fine
1521,Desmond  Hamlet,dr hamlet was a great teacher he is very loud though so he is intimidating but once you get past that he is a really nice guy he is pretty flexible and understanding about due dates etc but dont take one of his classes unless you are willing to work your butt off tough
1522,Desmond  Hamlet,strange and interesting man questionable teacher he will beat one aspect of a book to death unless the students comment during class tests bad as long as you regurgitate what he tells you class is far more interesting when people participate and he left to ramble for ages
1523,Desmond  Hamlet,no comments
1524,Desmond  Hamlet,course involves some incredible books but it is an english course without discussion and therefore much of an english course he is full of himself redundant and boring his thoughts on each book could be much shorter
1525,Eric  Winters,dr winters is a great professor he will spend a significant amount of time helping you if you need it he is passionate about his work and puts in a lot of effort to push students to get out of their comfort zones and think about topics in a more abstract manner if you want to get an a in his class you have to be willing to work hard
1526,Eric  Winters,the professor is very friendly and loves to give to give students life lessons the class can be boring at times boring because he loves to bounce around topics anatomy to life as for the exams quizzes and labs they are very easy best advice memorize everything and beware of falling behind in anatomy otherwise it will bite you in da ass
1527,Eric  Winters,funny guy okay teacher really easy all multiple choice
1528,Eric  Winters,his lectures are permanent tangents
1529,Eric  Winters,his lectures are interesting for awhile but sometimes you get the feeling that he just likes to hear himself talk his tests are tough
1530,Eric  Winters,so confusing and the tests are excruciating likes to hear himself talk
1531,Eric  Winters,no comments
1532,Eric  Winters,no comments
1533,Eric  Winters,a good guy
1534,Eric  Winters,he is very student oriented but hard to follow sometimes

1536,Orlando  Pascoa,he is a nice person who is very helpful
1537,Orlando  Pascoa,a really nice guy and a good counselor hes very helpful and knows his stuf well
1538,Orlando  Pascoa,no comments
1539,Orlando  Pascoa,great counselor
1540,Orlando  Pascoa,good
1541,Melissa  Knous,made the class interesting even enjoyed oedipus but no body can help othello she helped me to understand and enjoy english i think a fantastic teacher and would take her again in a heart beat test are tuff though ya have to read the material and study always an essay but if you study get it and she is hot
1542,Melissa  Knous,she tells a lot of personal stories in class easy to persuade and you can make her change the syllabus she put you on the spot very helpful and good overall
1543,Melissa  Knous,great teacher one of my favorites and shes hot too
1544,Melissa  Knous,she is a good teacher caring and dedicated hot very hot
1545,Melissa  Knous,she is a very helpful teacher but she is extremely slow grading papers her tests are very hard all grammar good teacher but way to slow in grading and letting you know your grades
1546,Melissa  Knous,very patient for those of us who were not good at grammar
1547,Melissa  Knous,she is extremely nice but she expects you to know your stuff her tests are very hard and if you know how to write an essay before you take her class you will fail she will help you in any way she can but be prepared to write and read boring stories like oedipus rex othello hard but good
1548,Melissa  Knous,mrs knous is a wonderful teacher she is very helpful and caring if you put forth the effort she will help you all she can and you will learn there is not another english teacher at ac i would even concider sitting under
1549,Melissa  Knous,wonderful teacher smart friendly and hard at first but if you make an effort you can do great and learn a ton from her i wish she had engl in the classroom it would probably help a lot of students
1550,Kathryn  Denning,should have taken another course not helpful not relevant ideas are absurd content useless
1551,Kathryn  Denning,anth of outer space is possibly the best class had denning is an absolute delight she is extremely quickwitted and can talk at length without putting everyone to sleep granted i was very keenly interested in the content to start with thoughtprovoking and funny her teaching style is casual but effective
1552,Kathryn  Denning,she is amazing her wealth of knowledge is limitless she is an inspiration in every aspect of life i want to take every class she has every taught awesome honestly like technology though and still busy writing the book on the subject
1553,Kathryn  Denning,one of the best professors at york extremely intelligent passionate and beautiful she is also very nice helpful and understanding she gives the best lectures at york there are a lot of readings but its not necessary to do them all and not hard to get an a
1554,Kathryn  Denning,the most passionate had at york she loves what she does must read the text really interesting fair marker museum assignment is time consuming but great she uses videos for some of her lectures and everything she covers in lecture is posted study read text do reflections and assign and do well
1555,Kathryn  Denning,great professor interesting course but then we are left with no grades at all for any work from the year then we find that we get an ngr no grade reported followed by a ngr f for all of us that are to graduate in a few weeks we are stressed and freaking out
1556,Kathryn  Denning,very dynamic teacher
1557,Kathryn  Denning,we had her as a guest lecturer for nats1880 life beyond earth she has a great personality that just makes you smile she is a great speaker full of energy and very enthusiastic
1558,Kathryn  Denning,only anthropology class ever taken and i genuinely look forward to it every week she keeps lectures interesting is extremely personable and really knows her stuff
1559,Kathryn  Denning,great prof and probably the best prof i had this year assignments were easy and her instructions were easy to follow her lectures are always interesting and insightful the best feature of this course is the rom assignment
1560,Kathryn  Denning,amazing professor she really helps you succeed and her classes are very interesting
1561,Kathryn  Denning,she is an amazing lecturer and i love going to class she keeps the class very interesting and the lectures are very informative and fun she keeps the students engaged all the time overall if you are going to take a class in which she is teaching will not want to drop the class going to be super awesome and you will learn amazing
1562,Kathryn  Denning,took anth with her last term and definitely one of the best profs had she is so passionate about the subject it makes us all excited about it too she covers the textbook very well and is still able to pull in other interesting facts and stories without getting sidetracked lectures were long but i never once looked at the time
1563,Kathryn  Denning,the best prof ever had never seen anyone being so passionate about the subject she is very very helpful and really cares about her students the course involves a lot of readings but her lectures are incredible and really interesting which helps a lot
1564,Kathryn  Denning,really awesome prof really fun and really engages the entire class with the course material she makes more of a discussiontype environment than a classroom and is more of a friendly classmate as opposed to a professor the class was really interesting but a lot of reading she is really clear on what she wants you to do take her classes
1565,Kathryn  Denning,the class was interested i have to admit learned some new things and the professor is very passionate and energetic i normally would not complain about the amount of reading in upper year courses but she assignmed pages per week and almost never discussed them in class also the poster party honestly i felt like i was in grade again
1566,Kathryn  Denning,amazing prof her course was informative and fun she is very clear with the requirements of the course and what is expected she incorporates videos discussions visuals in her lecture class just flew by just do your work attend class and do great she is also very helpful with the final essay ask her for help and there
1567,Kathryn  Denning,an amazing professor very energetic and obviously passionate about the course lectures are nearly always very interesting she knows how to interact well with students and seems very approachable gives very clear guidelines for quizzes a lot of reading though and lectures always touch on them much museum assignment is interesting
1568,Kathryn  Denning,without a doubt the best prof had at university yes a lot to read but typical third year reading load so i complain her lectures were insightful informal and a lot of fun great to talk to about the course material during office hours even if you understand it already i wish i could take the course again
1569,Kathryn  Denning,great prof energetic and imaginative i think she could make any lecture bearable if not outright enjoyable
1570,Darcy  Irvin,hard grader but her comments are very helpful very friendly and approachable lots of reading and critical analysis of the text took the class during summer and had to write papers no midterms and a fairly difficult final lots of inclass writing i would recommend her if you want to improve your writing and analysis skills
1571,Darcy  Irvin,great very useful comments and advice
1572,Darcy  Irvin,bright coherent lecturer grades the essays rather hard but as are attainable readily available and extremely helpful during ohs
1573,Darcy  Irvin,besides the essay class i attended the cultural studiesiiamerican satire class as well when darcy was over in mainz last year and i must say that both classes were some of the best i have ever attended if you consider taking an essay course go with darcy there is a lot of work to do but you learn how to use your writing skills great
1574,Darcy  Irvin,darcy was over in germany at the mainz university think she was a great teacher and was on one level with the students lots of reading but after all a pretty good class
1575,Darcy  Irvin,seriously what a liberal bother taking this class unless you are ready to write endless essays about points that she agrees with ignore her when she asks to argue your point of view if its not hers you are wrong and you will recieve a bad grade
1576,Darcy  Irvin,she grades tough on essays but very nice and helpful liked her class
1577,Darcy  Irvin,she is not only hot she is the bestest english prof ever i heard that if you do the reading and the writing and have it structually and grammatically correct get an easy a i took it and not only was it a cinch it was interesting too woe be the peon who take this class
1578,Darcy  Irvin,i know why other people love darcy she presents tons of civil rights issues yes but open to any point of view good comments on writing and really helpful with developing a thesis citing works and presenting a strong argument
1579,Darcy  Irvin,presents biased views of highly political issues spent more time studying antiwar proflag burning and same sex marriages with some mla format stuff improving your writing itself apparently not in this class
1580,Darcy  Irvin,this was such a great class everyone says that like writing boot camp and at times it was but pretty easy there are a lot of short reading assignments and essays throughout the quarter great teacher who makes it interesting good class
1581,Darcy  Irvin,i think supposed to be teaching high school not college no wait i mean she should be in high school i think about years old why she just teach it straight instead of confusing everything with those freakin hobbits
1582,Darcy  Irvin,definitely not an easy class however she leaves you with plenty of opportunity to improve nice helpful good teacher but not an easy a class and does involve a lot of writing
1583,Darcy  Irvin,no comments
1584,Darcy  Irvin,tons of writing and you have to learn how to make a solid argument no easy highschool bs girls are cute cute
1585,Darcy  Irvin,awesome teacher recommended
1586,Paul  Bender,he says that a is a good grade and that a is not bad and he believes it friendly and easy to talk to but just following his advice get you an you have to go beyond the requirements and defend every point if you want the grade also make sure you speak out in class and be prepared for pop quizzes
1587,Paul  Bender,no comments
1588,Paul  Bender,in my experience dr bender was not willing to help out and when he did try to help me was extremely unclear on every answer he gave me never disliked a professor as much as i dislike him
1589,Paul  Bender,almost impossible to get an a but a b is possible with some hard work if gonna say something in class be prepared to defend it
1590,Paul  Bender,take bender if you like to argue your point of view because he expects you to try to intimidate you on the first day of class but honestly if you take a proactive stance on your effort in his classes you will be more than rewarded if willing to learn teach you a lot
1591,Paul  Bender,out to get you if he like the topics of your papers you might as well give up
1592,Paul  Bender,bender is awesome if you love to argue he definitely makes you work for your grade but worth it and are possible a great prof and more than willing to help you out
1593,Paul  Bender,dr bender is extremely hard but the things you learn from his class are incredibly valuable
1594,Paul  Bender,class is hard but he teaches valuable info worked hard to get a b but feel better about my writing skills
1595,Paul  Bender,hard but his work does have a purpose brace yourself that c
1596,Paul  Bender,hated him
1597,Paul  Bender,i enjoy his lectures i often felt that they had nothing to do with the subject matter and although some of his assignments were challenging in a good way i felt that they had nothing to do with the class that i signed up for
1598,Paul  Bender,great guy who cares about his job more than willing to help class is difficult but you will learn a great deal from him be prepared to defend your opinion
1599,Paul  Bender,he is so funny and a lot of fun i loved being in his class because he was nice and helpful he is willing to work with you if something happens and you cant get your stuff done he is a great guy but beware of the first day of class its interesting
1600,Paul  Bender,he really care about grades he judges you from first meeting and desides your grade then no matter your ability be prepared for a c
1601,Paul  Bender,good guy respects your opinion semihard to get an a but just take your b and move on
1602,Paul  Bender,no comments
1603,Burlon  Wilkerson,make sure everything is turned in correctly you will not pass if you accadintally forget something i heard that she is great if you go and talk to her in person but she does not understand how to use technology in the least she will give zeroes if she feels need and even if she
1604,Burlon  Wilkerson,not a good instructor he has a superiority complex makes tests harder than textbook content grades more harshly as semester progresses steer clear of this one
1605,Burlon  Wilkerson,i expected him to be hard but he is really clear about what he wants and if you just do what you are supposed to you will make a good grade i hate public speaking but he made it not so bad i notice that everyone who ranks him poorly is a poor maybe they had problems in his class because they just very bright
1606,Burlon  Wilkerson,lots of assignments but most only require of your time very easy only tests and then the final both test are open book the only way you will not receieve a good grade is if you just dont turn anything in very nice and helpful
1607,Burlon  Wilkerson,this is a difficult class as far as grading there is a lot of homework assignments none of which are hard just time consuming the open book tests can be challenging yet you know what you will be doing well in advance this class is what you make it prepare to work
1608,Burlon  Wilkerson,his class really that hard we did speeches all test were open book the final is very easy he always opens the very first class with a magic trick he is a very monotone person you can get away with missing a few classes but if you dont wanna read the book then dont miss class he says to read but i never did i still passed
1609,Burlon  Wilkerson,mr wilkerson is an experienced and almost overqualified teacher be cautious when you take him his class is hard with a heavy schedule a vulture about texting and he know how to respond to public criticism this class is his life and he expects it to be yours so be prepared
1610,Burlon  Wilkerson,for a speech teacher the class is extremely boring and monotone after all main point of public speaking is keeping your audiences attention if you can not do this how does he think he can teach you to do it
1611,Burlon  Wilkerson,i took him for speech and we wrote like or speeches all tests are from the book he grades real hard and if you have a heavy schedule take him he gives out lots of work
1612,Burlon  Wilkerson,he was not an easy teacher but i still pulled an a you have to practice practice for your speeches tests are all open book so that was nice final was an essay
1613,Burlon  Wilkerson,open the first class with a magic trick lol pays close attention to detail and repeats things a lot it gets old fast but the work very hard
1614,Burlon  Wilkerson,extremely easy all notes given on overhead outline provided to follow for speaches tests are open book and the final was an essay that you got to do at home graded fairly all in all an easy a
1615,Burlon  Wilkerson,he is a difficult teacher grades tough alot of writing in this class like the class not crazy about teaching style
1616,Burlon  Wilkerson,if you ask a question he will look at you like you are stupid lectures have no relations to the tests tests cover huge amounts of info lots of assignments do not take this class if you have a hefty schedule no matter how good you think you may have done on an assaignment it is not good enough his grades will tick you off
1617,Burlon  Wilkerson,one of the worst professors at this school
1618,Burlon  Wilkerson,very unclear in lecture out of classes he only had as will never take again
1619,Burlon  Wilkerson,hard teacher gets off track in lecture if you are female you will get a good grade
1620,Burlon  Wilkerson,spch
1621,Burlon  Wilkerson,i took him for speech and interpersonal communication the interp class was harder than the speech but i did well in both be prepared to work he is very helpful when you ask for it i enjoyed his classes and learned a lot if want to learn he is the one to take
1622,Burlon  Wilkerson,exams cover and include essay analysis questions essays are assigned for homework that apply theory to events in your personal life graded on and insight oral presentations on assignments are shared with class
1623,Carol  Bennet,great teacher very helpful and cares about her students she gives assignments that are worthwhile to class
1624,Carol  Bennet,great teacher if you go to class and take notes she outlines the assignments extremely clearly to make them easy to write dont really need the book if you have an a at the end of the class you need to take the final
1625,Carol  Bennet,go to class and pay attention she wants you to do good and will always help you out just make sure to do all your work and you will get a good grade
1626,Carol  Bennet,if you pay attention to carol you will learn a lot and get a good grade
1627,Carol  Bennet,a lot of work but very helpful
1628,Carol  Bennet,she is a good teacher class is structured quite a bit of work but as long as you stay on top of your assignments you will be good she is anal about attentance
1629,Carol  Bennet,sort of hard but very good
1630,Carol  Bennet,no comments
1631,Carol  Bennet,very particular person to paragraph and sentence structure attendance is almost mandatory her assigned seating must sit in assigned seat only eat in class like when you walk out of class i recommend unle
1632,Carol  Bennet,no comments
1633,Kristen  Asplin,intro to psych was easy she put her powerpoints online so skip class make sure to study notes and book bc she puts questions on the exams that we cover in class
1634,Kristen  Asplin,dr asplin is really knowledgeable and is good at explaining tough material she is a great resource of information for psych students especially she can come across as very serious at times but also very laidback and forthcoming about her expectations attend class regularly because she really helps you to get the material do the h.w
1635,Kristen  Asplin,attendance is absolutely mandatory she does not put the power points online which kind of stinks her tests are hard and require a lot of studying nice lady though
1636,Kristen  Asplin,she is amazing honestly the most intelligent and realistic professor i have had she is so smart and funny i actually wait for class she is so interesting and helpful i will take her every chance i get love her
1637,Kristen  Asplin,dr asplin has to be one of the best professors at upg she is a wonderful professor and cares about her students dr asplin even cares about her students outside of her classroom and is easily accessible to her students i am glad i took her for classes while i attended pitt greensburg she was helpful when i took this course
1638,Kristen  Asplin,personally with most psychology classes i forget the material after a semester but i feel dr class if very different she made the topic very interesting even though my class was hours long it didnt seem it at all definitely take this class dr asplin is so nice and very direct about what she wants
1639,Kristen  Asplin,one of the best professors to pick up as a freshman she understands kids and she is a very good teacher who makes psychology interesting
1640,Kristen  Asplin,i really enjoyed this class professor asplin is super clear when speaking and a lot of the exams come from the power points it is important to read the book though because material is used from there too overall this class was informative and not hard
1641,Kristen  Asplin,i love her she keeps all of her students engaged in what learning and so funny definitely one of my favorite professors do everything you can to take her she grades papers super easily and give a lot of tedious work but buy the textbook i have never used mine
1642,Kristen  Asplin,she is a very educated woman she knows what she is talking about her tests are pretty difficult but she gives projects that boosts your grades a lot if you go to class and take decent notes it is not hard to earn at least a b
1643,Kristen  Asplin,nothing negative to say about her one of my favorite professors at upg love working with her and highly recommend her lectures are crystal clear and lenient about meeting up to get help actually enjoys her job
1644,Kristen  Asplin,buy the book because she basically only grades you on discussed in class attendance mandatory but inclass worksheets are random and count for a grade i like how few grades there were the class was out of points she uses a lot of examples to make concepts clear
1645,Kristen  Asplin,easy easy easy if you fail this class it is simply because you really did not try you could fail every test never go to class and get as on all the projects and pass with a solid c i know this because i did it
1646,Kristen  Asplin,powerpoint reader this professor makes absolutely zero effort to take what is clearly collective of knowledge and turn it into a forum for active discussion or a lesson instead keeps on on with the stupid powerpoints that come along with the book she made us waste on based on this worst prof ever had
1647,Kristen  Asplin,good class hard projects lets you pick your best tests out of projects are fun and enjoyable i would recommend this
1648,Kristen  Asplin,the lectures are enjoyable the projects and papers are easy and the exams are reasonable honestly the only bad thing i can think of saying is that she made us buy an expensive book that barely used she seems to really care about her classes
1649,Kristen  Asplin,enjoyable classes
1650,Kristen  Asplin,one of the most helpful and knowledgeable professors i have ever had in college very clear and extremely helpful you can tell not there for just a paycheck but sincerely cares about helping students understand the material super busy on campus but will make time for you attendance is mandatory
1651,Kristen  Asplin,one of the better professors this campus has i can actually remember some of the material that we went over which i took over a year ago effective teacher who was energetic clear interesting lessons neat assignments highly recommended class and professor
1652,Kristen  Asplin,i like classes at small campuses where they cram like students into a lecture hall however for managing such a big class asplin really cares about her students and that they do well not always in her office during hours but more than willing to meet with you do the reading write the papers come to class pass
1653,Kate  Greene,kate care what anyone thinks and awesome she a feminist and buddhist with very strong political opinions she see for herself class discussions are always fun if you have a problem with other opinions take her classes
1654,Kate  Greene,dr greene is an excellent professor she is very opiniated but she can defend every single one of her views with facts statistics etc also if you have a different view she will let you share with the class because she encourages debate she will not treat you any differently if you have a different opinion do your readings and you will pass
1655,Kate  Greene,she lectures from a piece of paper does not write anything on the board most importantly she very rude and creates a hostile learning environment she do not care about any of your other classes because she makes it very clear that her class is more important than your others she is just very unprofessional
1656,Kate  Greene,not much homework all test are written response but she give awesome test reviews if you come to class you will pass
1657,Kate  Greene,i highly recommend this professor she is intelligent and cares about her students very much i loved her class the most out of all of my political science courses so far be prepared to read everything though and to work for your grade the tests too bad if you read all of the material and keep up with your assignments
1658,Kate  Greene,this was such a great class i learned a lot and it was really easy to pass as long as you showed up and you did the work she ask a lot of students there is a page paper so beware of that if you decide to take her class
1659,Kate  Greene,i do not remember the course code but the course was a level and was intro to american legal systems she was very cool and down to earth she is not one of the professors who think that because they have a degree they are better than you although the note taking can be confusing at times she is magnetic and i would recommend to anyone
1660,Kate  Greene,a class with kate should be compulsory she will expand your mind and educate you with skills and knowledge that will reach far beyond the classroom her women and politics class was my favorite during my time at usm i carry the lessons learned with me in my life kate greene educator teacher inspiration
1661,Kate  Greene,i find dr ability to connect with her students refreshing engaging lectures and constant feedback with her audience she is obviously passionate about education the drawback is that note taking on lectures is difficult the material is based on the ongoing changes in the legal and social society textbooks are fairly irrelevant
1662,Kate  Greene,dr greene is probably the most awesome teacher had my whole life she is unapologetic about her views and she has no problem telling you why she feels the way she does with facts stats and history here in ms such a refresher to see someone push back with the norm here and really make their students think so thankful for her
1663,Kate  Greene,interesting class frequently in spats with the uni president and teaches from her perspective as a lesbian feminist excellent for learning about civil liberties in constitutional law
1664,Kate  Greene,dr.greene is my favorite teacher at usm so far she really makes you think from a different perspective she is very opinionated and not afraid to tell you hers same as all of the other comments do not make her mad
1665,Kate  Greene,liberal feminist teaching in one of the most conservative places in the country she is interesting and if you open your mind you will leave enlightened and changed unapologetic and sometimes frightening she is serious but has a good sense of humor class consists of powerpoints lecture and note taking easy class if you pay attention
1666,Kate  Greene,kate teaches political science from a liberal point of view in one of the most conservative places on the planet as such she gets a lot of resistance from her students but if you go in with an open mind you will emerge enlightened this class really amped up my interest in politics warning do the readings or you will incur her wrath
1667,Kate  Greene,no comment
1668,Kate  Greene,really funny but we get much done in class memorize lecture notes and google keywords for essay fluffing as a person she feels and believes heart on her sleeve sort very approachable sorta boyish and grumpy but she smiles
1669,Kate  Greene,kate is a wonderful teacher who challenged me more than any teacher i ever had any detractors are simply weak in intelligence and tolerance any person who is a true scholar would love her classes
1670,Kate  Greene,great teacher but makes no apologies for anything that comes out of her mouth.if you are offended easily take her class i would also not piss her off even though she is one that you can joke with take her seriously when she begins to warn you the whole class will feel her rath if angered
1671,Kate  Greene,i have taken several classes from kate and fabulous controversial unapologetic and constantly challenges her students to think instead of regurgitating information
1672,Kate  Greene,no comments
1673,Carey  Hissey,best instructor ever be prepared to work work work if you do and you listen and take criticism the world is yours carey will prepare you for anything although her classes are if you come prepared and show initiative you can usually be let go to work on your own she will allow you to succeed on your own if you can
1674,Carey  Hissey,very helpful as long as you ask deadlines are expected to be met or the class can fire you as an illustrator expect to work outside of class have good technique learn a lot by end of class usually make you stay all class period except for critiques good effort good grade
1675,Carey  Hissey,such an amazing professor she really knows who is going to make it and who in the real world also gives great advise on how to showcase your portfolio i would recommend her to anyone
1676,Carey  Hissey,she brought the to what design is rather than coming off as a typical cut it in the type of stigma a professor can get in this industry
1677,Carey  Hissey,everyone else seems to love this woman but me i do have a little bitterness towards her though because as my advisor she told me not to pursue gd anymore because i draw while anyone who knows me thinks my drawings are actually really good i guess she is just looking for prodigies
1678,Carey  Hissey,no comments
1679,Carey  Hissey,carey is a great instructor she is very helpful in getting ideas started deadlines are deadlines though you have to be dedicated to your work and get your projects in on time especially for critiques se is defintely an excellent instructor
1680,Carey  Hissey,she teaches all levels of illustration on the lower level courses she is pretty easy on students just as long as they get their work done by deadlines on the upper level she is a bit more demanding of high quality work which in the end is a good thing
1681,David  Pearson,this class is hard you will put in hours of hw and this must be done right since it is graded oh and you will be doing this blind with no prior guidance class tries to cover too much material which never gets tested away
1682,David  Pearson,materials are always explained after the homework for that section is turned in
1683,David  Pearson,if majoring in accouting at case you be able to avoid pearson a great professor a shame there more like him gives way too much homework
1684,David  Pearson,no comments
1685,Chris  Ramsey,chris is a thoughtful and conscientious professor not always exactly crystal clear with his instructions but if you have an i.q higher than that of an earthworm you can usually figure out what talking about and if you have questions just ask him really approachable he expects a lot out of you and a good thing
1686,Chris  Ramsey,he knows his stuff and has a high skill level when it comes to talking to people though he is way too delicate hem and haw for an hour instead of just saying that looks bad let me tell you why but when you coax it out of him his insights and feedback are invaluable gain more skill in this class than in most of any subject
1687,Chris  Ramsey,i love chris he is super nice and really wants to help you his class is easy if you actually work hard never had to work after hours or anything he helps you even if you ask him the same question a million times he seems genuinely concerned about you help you through any issues you have highly recommend
1688,Chris  Ramsey,chris is a super nice guy and a great teacher he is really fun but still wants you to learn at the same time i would reccommend him to anyone
1689,Chris  Ramsey,i think he was a great teacher he was arrogant and some say gay i had a crush on him why i have no idea
1690,Chris  Ramsey,more of a than an educator watch selfindulging artist
1691,Chris  Ramsey,artist seems most interested in himself more than the students
1692,Chris  Ramsey,great creative and engaging instructor
1693,Chris  Ramsey,no comments
1694,David  Rayson,overall just fine he seems to push his political stance on students every chance he gets and argues with students when they agree with him after a while i stopped attending class and still got if you turn your papers in he will give you the credit and probably not even read them its more graded on completion than anything else
1695,David  Rayson,david is awesome and funny he might be retiring soon so he is slacking off on harsh of assignments he uses many ways of teaching videos lectures acting something out etc its a history class so expect it to be kinda boring
1696,David  Rayson,prepare for a lot of writing david is an excellent professor and is very dedicated to the teaching profession
1697,David  Rayson,i usually dont rate professors on here but i felt like i needed to let people know that david rayson is possibly the best professor you will probably ever come across in your life you can turn in assignments whenever is most convenient for you even after semester is over you can also revise every assignment as many times as you want
1698,David  Rayson,david is a good professor the best part of his classes are that there is no penalty for turning in late assignments and that attendance is optional but i would recommend going to his lectures for further information lots of readings and essays to write it was a good class
1699,David  Rayson,david is a really nice guy and does want you to do well but he is late just about everyday during his lectures he jumps all over the place and it is hard to follow boring the whole classes is writing papers there are small papers every week and both the midterm and final are big papers very tough grader
1700,David  Rayson,david really cares about his students and their success he does require lots of reading but it is all very interesting if you love history you like this class he does have lots of papers but most of them are page papers he has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers amazing teacher
1701,David  Rayson,very understanding and an overall great person he cares for the students thus he punish you for not attending class or turning in assignments late articles on d2l used to take notes and write a short essay time consuming but very easy he does service learning so i got enough e.c to skip writing a final paper oh yeah no exams
1702,David  Rayson,i loved class ancient history usually my thing but he found subjects that could spark students interest he is very supportive of his students and occasionally goes on little rants about how we are in charge of our education not the other way around and actually told us to come here to do research on our professors really great
1703,David  Rayson,great guy who understands what students go through and tries to make it easier on students by helping them with the workload and due dates
1704,David  Rayson,great guy lets you turn in papers whenever it is convenient for you really cares about his students
1705,David  Rayson,dr rayson was by far the best professor i had in my time at normandale he is truly inspired me to do better in each assignment i handed in his tests are essays in which you will know about weeks in advance he allows revisions to these essays until you get the grade you want i highly recomend this instructor to anyone
1706,David  Rayson,i was not a history major but i took classes with david due to his ability to engage and inspire all of those in his presence his experience and wisdom are so profound that i always left each class feeling empowered and more compassionate the best of the best i highly recommend him to any student
1707,David  Rayson,take him an amazing teacher i got an a and did moderate work you also learn a lot from him like others said he is funny too and has a good personality
1708,David  Rayson,there are no tests in his class only papers but they are weekly he is very spontaneous and funny in class and some of the movies he shows are good attendance is very loose and extra credit is very easy to get and there are lots of opportunities for it also a very easy grader as long as you make all the points he wants to hear in papers
1709,David  Rayson,david was easily the best professor ever had hilarious and kind you can make up any assignment he ever assigns without penalty so wise i could listen to him talk for hours if you need a history credit and into history even if you are this is your guy take a class with rayson and you be disappointed
1710,David  Rayson,super funny and nice guy his class is pretty easy and you can retake your assignments
1711,David  Rayson,a caring loving easy going and he is by far a great teachers there no way to fail his class no way
1712,David  Rayson,a great professor he gives good feedback the class was very interesting
1713,David  Rayson,taken his next semester for two different classes no test and lot of movies he is great lay back over all a very good teachers you will not fail
1714,Arthur  Kroker,he is fascinated by what he teaches and it actually inspired me to learn not many teachers can do that he really cares about his students asks us questions to make sure he is teaching the subject well enough one of my favourite professors
1715,Arthur  Kroker,nice guy and amazing lecturer certainly knows his mcluhan however between the take home exams and essay you are ending up writing a lot certainly more than any other poli sci lecture or seminar
1716,Arthur  Kroker,my favorite uvic prof i still read ctheory and i graduated years ago
1717,Arthur  Kroker,he is definately brilliant when it comes to technoculture and postmodernism and gives you a new perspective but i had a hard time following the material put a lot of work into my papers for mediocre marks not an easy class but fresh and new
1718,Arthur  Kroker,kroker is a breath of fresh in the uvic poli sci dept however i found him to be dogmatic in his insistance on as the only legitimate type of study anyone who wants to be challenged should seek him out but not for an easy a
1719,Arthur  Kroker,brilliant mind very respected technoculture scholar tough marker super interesting and inspiring lectures an honor to have been in his class wished i liked cyberculture a bit more though the contents were hard to graps concretely
1720,Arthur  Kroker,say enough good things about him great teacher not easy to grasp but very inspiring respectful of his students openminded tolerant in sum best teacher ever had take a class with him if you want to expand your horizons
1721,Arthur  Kroker,cool class
1722,Arthur  Kroker,very very smart and knows the pomo world of cyberculture intimately rightly considered the successor to marshal mcluhan however class ends up being mostly fun coffee cafe intellectual masterbastion needs some meat in the lectures
1723,Ted  Tarkow,professor tarkow makes any topic interesting i had him for two separate classes and it was obvious that he really cares about his students and his classes he can explain any concept and make it easy to understand but he also pushes you to discover things for yourself you get out what you put in so definitely do the required readings
1724,Ted  Tarkow,ted a legend the man is hilarious and an amazing story teller struggled with his essays but he was always willing to help got to that final ready to ace it highly recommended great
1725,Ted  Tarkow,one of the greatest professors ever have i took ancient world with him a class that i particularly interested in but he made it relevant and interesting i loved a higher grade but i regret taking it an awesome person to know dean of arts sciences and really cares about his students take his class
1726,Ted  Tarkow,tarkow is the best professor had at mizzou really funny and is very open to different ideas and interpretations he is a relatively harsh grader but if you do the work and pay attention in class you should be fine
1727,Ted  Tarkow,taking greek classics in translation with him super fun teacher mostly lectures with some discussion interesting fair grader
1728,Ted  Tarkow,he doesnt use blackboard or powerpoints and is pretty hard to follow while taking notes you kinda have to adapt to his style
1729,Ted  Tarkow,one of the greatest teachers i have ever had tarkow is able to take comments at the beginning of class and weave his lecture around those points the discussion is always deep but never tangential he has a wonderful classroom presence a picky grader but he gives you all the tools in class you could ever need to do well
1730,Ted  Tarkow,tarkow is a great guy some of his jokes get a little old after a while especially his comparisons to walmart and mu sports teams eager to help and enjoys what he does
1731,Ted  Tarkow,no comments
1732,Ted  Tarkow,the best professor had so far makes mythology fun and easy to remember i will never forget the voices
1733,Ted  Tarkow,really a nice guy someone you feel comfortable chatting with and going to with concerns about the class definitely not an easy class though myth contains a lot of information and it takes a lot of studying time to be successful on his exams
1734,Ted  Tarkow,tarkow is hilarous and tells jokes that are actually funny extremely personable his summaries of myths are incredibly good and he knows a crazy amount the tests are fairly easy if you are willing to study i highly suggest his classes
1735,Ted  Tarkow,ted tarkow the man the myth the legend he is seriously the single best professor ever seen uses humor acting and craziness to help any student learn the material ted tarkow is the man
1736,Max  Smith,professor smith will make you work for an a but it is achievable stay ahead with your papers writing a paper the night before will not cut it the worst thing you can do to yourself is skip his class pop quizzes are frequent but easy if you take notes when he lectures and review them put in the work you will do great
1737,Max  Smith,difficult an inaccessible teacher he is one of the teachers that care about students mean and inconsiderate very boring lectures stupid quizzes find another teacher if you can
1738,Max  Smith,to save yourself do not take this class max is like a robot and his lectures are boring he gives pop quizzes which stinks and he only grades your grammar and punctuation he also does not give good feedback and is unorganized if he mixes up your papers with another class you will get an f on that paper for your own good do not take him
1739,Max  Smith,i know why everyone else is complaining so much about this class it is a very easy a if you show up and do your homework you will pass he is a very easy grader if you have basic writing skills or just check your grammar with grammarly his class is incredibly boring though and there are daily quizzes very easy though
1740,Max  Smith,i had smith for freshmen composition he was a decent teacher but one thing i noticed was he didnt really care about the writing aspect of your paper as long as the grammar was near perfect you got an a also the quizzes he gives are stupid and basically re worded from the last quiz good thing they only make up also dont miss class
1741,Max  Smith,in my opinion he have a good way of teaching he always quizzes you on grammar he show any powerpoint or examples and most of the time he spends the class time talking about things that even related to anything in class he always releases you early one of those teachers that seem not to care
1742,Max  Smith,it seems that when it comes to papers this professor care much about the writing instead he cares more on the punctuation his quizzes are random and repeated his lectures relate much to actually english
1743,Max  Smith,smith is a very professor he is a decent english professor but he expects professionalism out of his students there are pop quizzes at least twice a week but they are always very easy do not get caught procrastinating on your papers because he catches small mistakes very easily
1744,Max  Smith,simply the worst professor ever had care for students gives little to no sympathy what so ever hard to talk to and just not a nice guy i recommend not taking this class he is a tough grader does meaningless quizzes
1745,Max  Smith,daily attendance grades posted so your grade is unknown till the end make sure you listen closely to lectures and take detailed notes quizzes a week he spends class time talking about different essay topics instead of essay writing but if you work hard and follow his instructions closely an a is attainable
1746,Max  Smith,he refused to put any grades in the grade book i had no other errors in my papers except him writing confusing next to seemingly random sentences in my paper somehow warranting me with a c grade on most papers english has always been my strongest subject and i usually ace papers not with this guy miss a peer editing day on that paper
1747,Max  Smith,this teacher has no type of personality his lectures are boring he is not clear about what the assignments are going to be about he is very unorganized he care for his students attendance is a must he is a horrible teacher the whole class received no higher than a c avoid this class
1748,Max  Smith,definitely not an easy a but it is possible total of essays including the final the essay there are pop quizzes but if you attend class not too bad attendance is absolutely mandatory absences and your grade will drop a whole letter and there are no excuses smith very understanding try tofind a different prof if you can
1749,Max  Smith,torn about this professor there was a distinct rudeness from him at times that was very degrading and standoffish i want to maybe believe he is too intelligent to communicate with people of regular emotion at times he was understanding other times i felt his subtext was saying you are an idiot and i am more intelligent than you
1750,Max  Smith,this is the single worst teacher i have ever had in any of my years of schooling his criteria for grading is not well done but if you stray from what he wants you will lost points heavily extremely strict on grading and bother putting logic together about why you did what you did extremely lazy and very bad feedback on your errors
1751,Max  Smith,this is the only professor had that refuses to put grades in the gradebook i am paying a lot of money for his class so it is lazy of him to not simply do something nice for his students he is hard to talk to extremely boring and only does things that are convientent for him it almost seems as if he can care less about his students
1752,Max  Smith,rude like to take correction or be told he is wrong and unfair i do not recommend this instructor unless you are error free in everything you do
1753,Max  Smith,difficult teacher unless an advid writer do not take his will not help you even if you ask for can at times be when you try to ask something doesnt like being corrected even if you point a mistake out can tell he is not inspired to teach anymore dean refunded me right away without hesitation
1754,Max  Smith,very tough grader wants everything done his way i took this class online and unless you go to his office for every little thing you get a bad grade even if you email him the comments he gives for essays are subjective and demeaning would not recommend or take his class again took research writing classes at university they were easier
1755,Max  Smith,do not take this class he has no idea how to teach would talk about random things and is never helpful with the papers so hard to approach really care what your asking for unless you are a professional at writing take his class has stupid tests every class which are no help
1756,Jeff  Price,he was down to earth and polite very compassionate toward every student and says hello if he recognizes you around campus his passion for students is unrivaled among any other professors at osu
1757,Jeff  Price,learned a lot
1758,Jeff  Price,nice prof hard work
1759,Jeff  Price,i absolutely loved this class i thought jeff was an excellent teacher who really knows his stuff if you are electronic media like i am sure you will love it too
1760,Jeff  Price,i learned a lot in his class
1761,Jeff  Price,no comments
1762,Jeff  Price,awsome teacher
1763,Jeff  Price,his class is very tough so far the only class that talked about real world experiences he can sometimes be moody but overall i think very dedicated to the students the workload is a lot for nonemphasis area people
1764,Jeff  Price,knows his stuff on typography
1765,Jeff  Price,this class was very challenging and sometimes stressful but we covered a lot of material i think this professor really tried to bring the best out in us he also mentors us in a group of student designers to work in the professional world with clients none of the other professors do that
1766,Jeff  Price,this lazy egotistical unmotivated sorry excuse for a designer has no business in a classroom take as little of his classes as possible no matter what your focus
1767,Jeff  Price,i can not believe this man is still teaching he is a joke ever ask him a question because barely give you an answer and then make you feel like a complete idiot they need to get him out of there
1768,Jeff  Price,jeff is very egotistical and not very involved in the teaching process he has an ever changing opinion of your work has an unrealistic expectation in the quantity of work and has no real structure to his teaching no lesson plans no vocab only scattered links off the net and videos he bought
1769,Jeff  Price,he is a unhelpful he knows what he is doing but very negative and wants to scare everyone out of the graphic design program
1770,Jeff  Price,i warn you get on his bad side otherwise ruined
1771,Jeff  Price,jeff has been in the industry for a while so he has a perspective that many professors all about getting students to do better than they think they can with computer graphics and such very good teacher overall
1772,Lowell  Taylor,phd microeconomics
1773,Lowell  Taylor,awesome professor funny had him for the phd micro class was very hard but his teaching was excellent if you have to start the day with microeconomic theory this is how want to do it lots of homework
1774,Lowell  Taylor,this man is wicked smart makes econ fun and relevant proves you have to be an arrogant jerk to be a brilliant success i hear the intermediate class is hard the intro class was easy

1779,James  Davig,he is hard to hear so sit in front willing to help you outside of class if you understand fair multiple choice tests grades on a curve lets you use one page of notes for test hey guys this is accounting expect it to be fun
1780,James  Davig,i really do wish there was some way to pass his class i worked so incredibly hard and studied like crazy and still got a c at least not mean but if you take him sit in the front row because hard to hear
1781,James  Davig,this teacher is so hard just because you understand what saying and he makes up dumb accounting jokes
1782,James  Davig,he really is a bad teacher even if you try your hardest he will still fail you he is very hard to understand and work with if you take him good luck
1783,James  Davig,absolutely the worst teach ever had do not take him you can not understand him talk you are better off teaching yourself the material
1784,James  Davig,omg do not take this teacher he is a old man who just mumbles and teach
1785,James  Davig,not a bad prof lets you use notes on exams
1786,James  Davig,no comments
1787,James  Davig,run run as far away as you can
1788,Brenda  Nordenstam,totally boring you have to go to class to get the handouts but really hard to stay awake
1789,Brenda  Nordenstam,oh my worst class i have ever taken she talks all class about nothing we received so many handouts which was such a waste of paper her social process oviously do not represent her so told attitudes avoid her at all costs
1790,Brenda  Nordenstam,no comments
1791,Brenda  Nordenstam,no comments
1792,Brenda  Nordenstam,social processes and the environment
1793,Colin  Jerolmack,absolutely the best ever had really cares about his students will take the time to help you not an easy class but he makes even the most boring stuff interesting and understandable excellent
1794,Colin  Jerolmack,great teacher smart and passionate breaks down clearly and concisely workload seems heavy at first but doable his class is worth taking would definitely take him again also helps that easy on the eyes i sure paid attention

1797,Colin  Jerolmack,amazing
1798,Colin  Jerolmack,good professor
1799,Colin  Jerolmack,jerolmack is the best professor i have had during my four year college career he is extremely intelligent always helpful and provides thorough explanations of abstract ideas it was a pleasure and a great experience being in the presence of such an innovative teacher by the way he is hot
1800,Colin  Jerolmack,professor jerolmack is most likely the youngest and brightest professors i have ever had at hunter he is extremely bright and very patient with his students he relates more with the students personally than any other professor i have met i highly recommend taking his class read all of his books
1801,Colin  Jerolmack,very good professor gives good lectures offers a lot of help as long as you do the readings and the assignemnts good highly recommended
1802,Colin  Jerolmack,awesome

1804,Colin  Jerolmack,professor jerolmack is hands down one of the best professors at hunter take his class you regret it
1805,Colin  Jerolmack,he is the best sociology professor in hunter he knows his material very well if you take good notes and read the reading assingments you have any difficulties in his class
1806,Colin  Jerolmack,no comments
1807,Colin  Jerolmack,young cool and laid back but knows his stuff
1808,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,ian is a wonderful professor thoughtful understanding and he loves a good class discussion no quizzes no test just two writing assignments and a presentation he gives great feedback on everything he sometimes shares food with the class ask about his walnut but he never shares the recipes no matter how often you ask
1809,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,dr ian was one of the best professors ive had at eastern michigan i would recommend his section to everyone that wants to teach early education hes super relatable funny and has the most adorable british accent absolutely loved this guy
1810,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,i had ian in a very large lecture hall from what others have told me he shines much better in the smaller classroom size because of the large size i did not enjoy his teaching style it was hard to hear him and i sat in the close half if you take him make sure it is is a smaller setting
1811,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,had ian so many times lost count genuinely wonderful both as an educator and as a person each time had him been asked to examine literature in new and impactful ways respectful and interested in the opinions of his students you get away with not reading the books though so try it know highly recommend
1812,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,he is a solid professor and has his teaching assistants do most of his work for him graded on a couple quizzes tests and papers lecture heavy but the slides that go with it are pretty informational so if you miss a class or two it kill your grade we read a lot but they also go in depth about the books
1813,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,great professor had him for and again for great in the big lectures but try and take a smaller class with him if you can the only professor at eastern who even bothered to learn my name really wants to hear what you have to say challenging but not unfairly so highly recommended
1814,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,i love this professor taking him again in the summer totally knowledgeable in his field but he understands that students are not and that is why we are in class to begin with his tests are tough and need to devote some study time to any class with him but overall easy to learn from a wealth of information one of the best
1815,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,loved this professor easy and right to the point if you needed anything he was always there
1816,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,you have to read a lot of books there are pop quizzes one research paper a midterm and final he was pretty relaxed with the pop quizzes and let us work with other people he seems interested in what he is teaching the lectures could be really boring though
1817,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,this class was very interesting and you have a chance to learn a lot i recommend this class for all elementary education majors
1818,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,alright his lectures are long and unclear because he tells us to write down random adjectives i read one of the books and still passed with an a though mid term and final exam research paper and weekly quizzes lecture slides are online
1819,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,if you actually talk to him he is really sweet if he knows you from talking with you he will help you out most of the quizzes are group quizzes and he gives you the answers and extra credit you have to read a lot but a lot is from the lectures i would definitely recommend
1820,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,he is a horrible teacher give good lectures rambles on and on i would never have him as a professor again
1821,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,dr andrews is a great professor i loved his class he gives many extra credit opportunities you just need to read all of the texts to pass
1822,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,i was expecting this class to be easy it is not this is a lecture class you can expect to have a reading assigned every singe class period and half the time he unclear about what needs to be read i had multiple quizzes where the questions were irrelevant to the story that was read i have to take this class again with a different prof now
1823,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,he seems to be confused in his own lectures he gives you information then has test on something completely different
1824,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,love love loved this class being a lecture attendance is not technically mandatory but i always went it was enjoyable keep ahead on the readings and you will do fine dr andrews is an awesome professor extra credit opportunities
1825,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,very interesting class very well done with some fun humor thrown in if you love to read and can read fast this is certainly a class enjoy even if you get to the reading on a particular week sparknotes and whatever else will suffice very fun
1826,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,he made things clear in the class but if you thought that taking this class would be easy because of childrens books you were wrong near the end gets into young adult books that you read within a week sometime cram in a week if slow reader do not take research paper you should start early only test quiz every week
1827,Ian  Wojcik-Andrews,loved ian he is humorous and kind will get into conversations with you if interested his class is interesting to attend i recommend sitting in the front because a huge lecture hall the reading guide is slightly confusing but you can email the everyday and they will clarify highly recommend
1828,Daniel  Laskarin,one of the best in the department
1829,Daniel  Laskarin,one of the better uvic visual arts profs informed and less conceited than most in the field still somewhat entrenched in certain ideologies but no more than can be expected with most profs helpful and humorous full of insightful comments and suggestions
1830,Daniel  Laskarin,daniel was a very good teacher he could have taught more about sculpture but instead gave us materials and sent us on our way i would have liked more interaction and instruction in this class but daniel was very constructive with his criticism and was genuinely interested in helping his students do well pretty good for a foundation class
1831,Daniel  Laskarin,i posted the last comment daniel is the only va full time professor who conceited there are at least two excellent and grounded sessionals
1832,Daniel  Laskarin,daniel is an amazing man and a brilliant teacher he is the only uvic visual arts teacher who is not conceited anybody who dislikes him is bitter because he challenged them into understanding themselves he is always available for extra help and goes far out of his way to do so you must take his class if you care at all about learning
1833,Daniel  Laskarin,i really disliked daniel for much of the year but in the end i warmed up to him after realizing that he actually did care about students and wanted them to do well class tended to be quite chaotic which i like but i think i did some of my best work of the year in his class a good guy in his heart of hearts i think
1834,Daniel  Laskarin,smooth talker diplomatic probing stimulates interest great conversation call him on his more a lto goes under the radar it sounds so good
1835,Daniel  Laskarin,i have no interest in sculpture whatsoever cuz soo costly but daniel encouraged all of us to do our own thing and he respected all our opinon although his lectures might be hard to catch onto sometimes a cool but dont expect him to give u a high grade jus a decent grade will do
1836,Daniel  Laskarin,never had daniel in art classes but had him once in a critique not easy going straight to the problem and asking me to defend myself nstantly i like art teachers that actually tell you right and wrong
1837,Daniel  Laskarin,daniel is the best professor at uvic i strongly recommend his class he cares so much about his students let you do clay in but you have to do it right you have to want to do contemporary
1838,Daniel  Laskarin,daniel is helpful and caring he really takes pride in the accomplishments of his students just for the record you spell definitely um definitely just because in the visual arts mean we have to be illiterate
1839,Daniel  Laskarin,only had one class with him he basically mentioned that you use clay he feel like it was sculpture too bad for you too bad for uvic you lost a sculpture student but i will continue with my clay phew on you
1840,Daniel  Laskarin,i dunno dart doesnt cross my theres definiantly an absence of something go to the open houses if u need help lwll help u with info
1841,Daniel  Laskarin,hes pretty good i dont see anything to hate although he is a bit busy at times but tries to help when he can
1842,Daniel  Laskarin,no comments
1843,Daniel  Laskarin,daniel is a great sculpture prof i dont know where you all get the idea that he cuz he is he is so helpful and always has a lot to say and always takes you seriously definitly one of my favorite profs
1844,Daniel  Laskarin,loves himself way to much and definalty didnt teach me a thing dont waste your time he will make you hate sculpture forever
1845,Daniel  Laskarin,what a dart can you say pompous idiot his way or the highway and frankly his way blows sorry to all the members of daniels fanclub but you went to art school to be creative not to become little dart i mean daniels
1846,Amin  Ibrahim,great professor clear on explaining chem have to say i learned a lot by taking his class i definitely recommend him
1847,Amin  Ibrahim,dr ibrahim is a truly a great professor the material he covers easy but he makes sure that he explains it in a way in which the whole class will understand although the homework mandatory it really helps you grasp the main idea of the material and he also uses it as extra credit towards your final grade hard but not impossible
1848,Amin  Ibrahim,professor ibrahim is extremly nice and is understanding he drops the lowest grade and funny i would definatly take one of his other classes again best professor ever if i were you fight tooth and nail to get into his class
1849,Amin  Ibrahim,love this professor his accent thick at all compared to many other professors taken really helpful and tries to make sure everyone understands the problems before moving on and really funny i would definitely take his class again
1850,Amin  Ibrahim,awesome professor has a thick accent could barely understand anything he says but got used to it after the first week he teaches well drops the lowest test grade he is one funny dude
1851,Amin  Ibrahim,very helpful professor i took him during summer we were moving pretty fast but he was always concern that everyone get the topics he also make you participate during class working out problems and it help alot use the book is very helpful and it could be the difference from a a to a b oo yea and he is very funny
1852,Amin  Ibrahim,i love this man he is the best chemistry professor if u hate and dont understand jack sht then take him he explains really well gives alot of examples and doesnt move on until hes sure everybody gets it the book isnt needed but it helps cos u do problems off of it and it helps for the exams hes funny too great overall
1853,Amin  Ibrahim,he is a cool professor to have and i think he made the class kind of fun i would recommend him for any class since dr ibrahim i very helpful and will try to give real life examples to chemistry problems
1854,Amin  Ibrahim,professor is funny makes class fun
1855,Amin  Ibrahim,helpful at all during lab he was gone from the classroom most of the time if you need extra help during labs i suggest him i was glad that the class was finally over
1856,Amin  Ibrahim,he is a good professor he really explains the material being covered and also he assigns homework which is really helpful when taking the tests also he helps you at the end of the semester if you need it
1857,Amin  Ibrahim,ok
1858,Amin  Ibrahim,is a good teacher
1859,Amin  Ibrahim,very very helpful professor if you do not understand chem at all take him he takes you step by step working out every prob on the board he has a small accent but very easy to understand homework is rare tests are difficult but he will definitely help you understand chemistry i would definitely take him again if i had to
1860,Amin  Ibrahim,an ok lab teacher the only problem is that he is not around when you need to ask questiones he is usually in his office working on other classes
1861,Amin  Ibrahim,professor ibrahim is fast paced his exams are found in the library previous exams he does not place much emphasis on homework little to none you challenge him be prepared to stand your ground he is tricky so be careful
1862,Amin  Ibrahim,no comments
1863,Amin  Ibrahim,great teacher he works with you and is very freindly show up for his class and do his work and be fine talk while he teaches doesnt like it at all i highly recommend him
1864,Amin  Ibrahim,real hard to understand his english writes real small and light reading the book was more helpful points people out for questions and if you happen to come late to class take him
1865,Amin  Ibrahim,it was a very enriching experience it was difficult but the study guides were very helpful
1866,Lynne  Schubert,i got a c in the class but would of got an for knowing she will get fired soon
1867,Lynne  Schubert,the money i spent for this class should have gone to charity instead of her
1868,Lynne  Schubert,i felt like i was in a sequel to the twilight zone
1869,Lynne  Schubert,yes she was fired had her for semester very rough classes lectures had nothing to do with the exams read the book and u learn more i did learn a lot about budgeting and setting up corporate proposals this class had pitfalls but some mountains shes gone so oh well
1870,Lynne  Schubert,as all the others say she was lazy and know very much including the osi model as of summer she has been laidoff with a bunch of other staff devry is going down hill fast
1871,Lynne  Schubert,horrible professor lazy and have a clue how to teach is this the best devry can do i wish i had of known about her before hand then i would not never came to devry
1872,Lynne  Schubert,someone needs to teach this teacher how to do her job she has no concept of how to teach a class well all be warned if she comes up as one of your teachers switch your class fast she should definately be given the boot
1873,Lynne  Schubert,avoid this professor if you want to learn anything she wastes most lecture time and gives really poor exams too many mistakes and vague ans lab is a total joke this class would not even be worth taking for free i am only paying for the grade
1874,Lynne  Schubert,one of those so called teachers that wont go away
1875,Lynne  Schubert,the professor did not explain the materials properly her quizzes were based on a book full of errors and she did not assist anyone in finding the answers how she can teach at this school and take me money is ludicrous
1876,Lynne  Schubert,she has to be the worst professor that i had since been here at devry she is definitely a poor excuse for a professor she is extremely lazy and unreliable and should not be representing devry university she should be fired she serve no purpose here besides making students life a living
1877,Lynne  Schubert,she cannot teach if her life depended on it someone else should really try to teach this course a poor excuse for a professor as well as a human being she makes devry look bad i would have never fathomed that i would encounter such a professor
1878,Lynne  Schubert,hi unknown this professor should be ashamed for associating herself with humans because not.tcm210 is a fun course but this reptile schubert makes it so impossible to understand what the hell is going on
1879,Lynne  Schubert,does not explain anything can be vendictive be very nice to her or you will pay she does not answer questions or offer help via email claims she cant get it outside of class get very frustraited if you understand what she is saying
1880,Lynne  Schubert,horrible teacher her daughter is a reflection of her stupidity
1881,Lynne  Schubert,this woman is braindead she gives no help and has admitted she doesnt know what she is teaching if you tell her she is wrong and prove it she doesnt care constanly late blames you if she lost you work or if you have equip problems must be fired
1882,Lynne  Schubert,why is this women a teacher my guess is for the paycheck because she clearly has no interest whatsoever in helping anyone after she stumbles in late you will sit there for the most confusing of your life
1883,Lynne  Schubert,no comments
1884,Lynne  Schubert,worst professors in devry.she lacks teaching skills.there is pretty much no sense in attending the class cause the power presentation handouts is all the teaching that is always late and stumbles in like she was drinking the whole night before
1885,Lynne  Schubert,one of the worst teachers i have ever late doesnt know one thing about the topic and loses everything you give her and grades you on if she likes you or not she can care less about the work the student has done
1886,Christopher  Bracken,professor bracken does not deserve the bad rep he gets he is an amazing professor not a tough grader at all just realistic for a english class his lectures are very well organized and he provides good feedback on how to improve for your next essays
1887,Christopher  Bracken,interesting class but super tough and dense material there was a ton of reading and most of it was difficult to get through a tough marker but fair and he interacts with the material really well not a gpa booster and avoid if you have an already heavy courseload
1888,Christopher  Bracken,so many readings be prepared kinda has a thing against undergrads tough grader and very strict on grammar incredibly useful info in lectures but post anything online so take lots of notes great with giving feedback on essays and how to improve only test in this course was a midterm takehome assignment final is a research paper
1889,Christopher  Bracken,hardest english course ever taken the reading load is heavy you need time management skill or this class will be easy flunk lazy writers beware you will be punished worked to the bone for weeks to obtain a b learn a lot but if you already have a heavy course load save this class for a term with easier classes this is hard af
1890,Christopher  Bracken,a great lecturer but he have an email and post notes online so be prepped to write your own good notes as he lectures fast also i be concerned about asking questions in class as he will ignore you he marks harder than my level profs give remarks on how to do better just calls undergrads stupid a lot
1891,Christopher  Bracken,you get what you give bracken is not afraid to call students out on laziness and his honesty and high standards seem to unnerve undergrads however intelligent and well read and classes are funny and exciting he like email and office hours were near nonexistent but if gone to every class he will make time to talk to you
1892,Christopher  Bracken,this was the last class of my degree and certainly one of the best if not the best an interesting lecturer excellent course material puts in the effort to provide helpful written comments willing to discuss the readings with students in person after class
1893,Christopher  Bracken,very strict at first but lightens up as the semester goes on a tough but fair grader but gives good feedback to help you improve he explains the readings and what he expects on the essays if you bother showing up to class his lectures are dry but have great content
1894,Christopher  Bracken,let personality get in the way of what saying brilliant stuff while he do email he was always available after class for questions or comments he was also very honest which hurts fragile students but i wish i taken lower level classes before this one because i felt lost half the time
1895,Christopher  Bracken,he is a very intelligent man but should not be teaching undergrads on the first day he told us he does not give his email address out to undergrads he had us second years reading anatomy of criticism among other difficult and dry texts his feedback on essays had lots of criticism but few suggestions for improving avoid him as a prof
1896,Christopher  Bracken,you should choose to take professor courses because one of the few critical minds at the university of alberta who actually takes a bite out of reality the only issue is that professor bracken is so good at what he does that not only does he make other professors seem unqualified but he also reveals your own skill level
1897,Christopher  Bracken,i learned a lot from this course definitely the best taken at u of a
1898,Christopher  Bracken,really likes his theory and expects you to apply it and know it well get discouraged if he acknowledge your comments in class keep asking questions if you make it through his course your other classes be as hard definitely worth it
1899,Christopher  Bracken,bracken is probably the most difficult english professor ever taken basically for an english major he is the barbed wire fence you might want to throw yourself at his exams are based on a part a and a part b with three of the initial readings and three of the latter readings a tip for know both the conversion experience and the
1900,Christopher  Bracken,everything said before is true he can be arrogant and he does mark ridiculously hard but all for the reason of improvement my first essay was a c and after taking his feed back and applying it to my writing i improved a whole letter grade this is university teachers are not going to hold your hand he knows his stuff and expects you to work
1901,Christopher  Bracken,this man is the most arrogant and self righteous person i have ever met told us on the first day of class that he assign does not give his email to undergrads because we ask stupid questions and overall makes you feel belittled this man should not be teaching english
1902,Christopher  Bracken,definitely a very hard marker if i had known what the class would be like i would have dropped in immediately i think he would be better geared to graduate studies as he clearly dislikes undergrads from his constant criticism of them give out his email and office hours so after class help was impossible excessive amount of readings
1903,Christopher  Bracken,great prof clear and concise and knows his stuff
1904,Christopher  Bracken,excellent prof take his course if you put in the effort to improve you will be rewarded that exactly what this university thing is about
1905,Christopher  Bracken,worst prof ever no one got higher than a b in the class he told us that the semester would get better as it progressed as long as you applied what learned for the term essay worth the class average was a the kind of prof that never made it further in his field and is taking his frustration out on his students
1906,Kim  Finn,very easy class gives lots of reviews and even let us use open note for every basically just show up take notes and talk once in a while and do great
1907,Kim  Finn,best teacher ever very easy going makes the class very interesting and makes you feel like you want to be there take her
1908,Kim  Finn,great professor made learning fun tough exams but she explains the material really well of fun activities in class
1909,Kim  Finn,this professor made this class very interesting and fun never a dull moment
1910,Kim  Finn,i learned so much from this prof about my self family and relationships love the genogram best class at devry and great teacher
1911,Kim  Finn,great prof tough exams so get the text makes class fun though want to major in psych now
1912,Kim  Finn,great professor kept my interest and made it fun to learn even when the topics were difficult take this prof
1913,Kim  Finn,this is one of the worst professors in devry she know how to teach and she is not fair when it comes to grading very bad and inconsiderate i think she qualify to be teaching at all all she talks about in class is her personal problems take this professor for the class
1914,Kim  Finn,excellent class a lot of fun
1915,Kim  Finn,best professor ever you can tell she is incredibly passionate about teaching and really wants her students to learn the material incredibly friendly and very approachable and when i had questions outside of class she was more than willing to help take this professor
1916,Kim  Finn,she rocks
1917,Kim  Finn,very good teacher you be bored in class she makes learning fun and easy
1918,Kim  Finn,great person with genuine interest in her students no nonsense which is defiantly needed at a place like devry also wicked booty no matter what age
1919,Kim  Finn,great professor fun activities that helped me to learn the material she makes the class can also be no nonsense when students try to cheat on exams or hand in other work earned my respect
1920,Kim  Finn,pretty good looking but mad moody.one day stupid nice then some days shes just nasty alot of tests and no cheating like a hawk.fun class but not the easiest
1921,Kim  Finn,class is easy because teacher is awsome we learn by talking about real life experiences prof finn is very open minded she listens to us and learns from us as well great personality the first exam is standard multiple choice but you can use notes final is a short essay and a group talk show fun i loved her class and am saddened its over
1922,Kim  Finn,one of best keeps class very interesting would def take her again
1923,Kim  Finn,nice lady but i learn too much
1924,Kim  Finn,she rarely teaches spch275 so i was lucky to get her class she is a great professor she made it very easy for us to up to the front and speak the class was very fun
1925,Kim  Finn,she is a great profto the point in what she wants done and is more than fair
1926,Rose  Vydelingum,me very hard working student i take things very serious she is cold and her way is right way her thread discussion is plain useless waste of time every1 i would not recommend anyone take her if i ever have her again in my wildest dream i swear god me going drop out of her class i breath with the same air as she is i hate her
1927,Rose  Vydelingum,honestly in the beginning she seemed like a nice woman but upon further discovery she was very cold didnt really answer questions thoroughly always believed she was correct not a really exciting class at all
1928,Rose  Vydelingum,while her assignments and readings were a ton of work and boring overall i found her friendly she does seem to single students out on the threaded discussions though which is lame but she still seems to grade fair
1929,Rose  Vydelingum,strict teacher very picky must be exaclty her way you can not have an opinion it is wrong if she agree
1930,Rose  Vydelingum,tough grader her exams are totally off the wall questions in one hour time including an essay however open book nice lady though
1931,Rose  Vydelingum,good teacher but if she like you let you know it put up with any bull so give her any she will also single out students which i am completely against tough grader chior boy
1932,Rose  Vydelingum,good very helpfull
1933,Rose  Vydelingum,no comments
1934,Rose  Vydelingum,ehh not too bad not too exciting either projects are a pain
1935,Robert  Christie,great professor everyone complains that he makes you sing and dance if late just be late he definitely broke me out of my shell and made public speaking easier on me take christie he knows what doing and does it so fun
1936,Robert  Christie,this professor is a challenge this is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that you learn how to speak publically and debate plus if struggling he gives you a chance to pass a lot of feedback and extra credit so nearly no excuse to fail you work for your grade in this class i love this professor awesome
1937,Robert  Christie,he is the worst professor ever he is unfair and rather talk about his personal life than actually teaching the class i spent so much time reading homework threaded discussions i always completed everthing at and he still gave me grades according to how he felt he is an awful teacher dont waste ur time money and stress by takin
1938,Robert  Christie,grading was terrible enough said
1939,Robert  Christie,if you do what he ask of you you should be fine i really enjoyed the class and the people who took the class with me were amazing just follow every instruction that he gives and you should be fine i really enjoyed singing in front of the class
1940,Robert  Christie,he is a really good teacher i like the way he teaches he makes you understand going on i thoroughly enjoyed his class just study hard do what you gotta do and be fine be late or make you sing in front of the class all in all the class was fun pretty funny and cool once you know him better grading is alright
1941,Robert  Christie,this teacher is one of the worst teachers i have ever had he does not help you and riducles you when you make a mistake had to drop this class so it would not effect my gpa btw this teacher can not grade the tda is total bs if you post times and he will tell you the posts are relevant he will still give you a or worst teacher avoid a
1942,Robert  Christie,try to avoid taking this professor yes college is supposed to be challenging his grading system is ridiculously hard and unconsistent he is not an understanding professor and his methods of teaching should really change he needs to learn how to be a good professor be prepared to take a test every week in his class
1943,Robert  Christie,he was a bad teacher mad us feel like we where in grade he is useless he makes fun of you when you screw up during a speech
1944,Robert  Christie,this professor is tough this is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that you go to school to learn and not to just receive a degree we pay more for our degrees than rutgers students so we should expect to work for it you work for it in this class love this professor
1945,Robert  Christie,prof christie takes this class way too serious if your late expect to sing for the class
1946,Robert  Christie,he sucks if you have any class with him drop out fast
1947,Robert  Christie,tough class if your not a deep thinker this is not the class for you be prepared to memorize two books for the tests
1948,Robert  Christie,prof christie is a teacher that really cares about the performance of his students he insists that you are on time pay attention in his class the only people that i have ever heard complain about christie were the lazy ones who expect to get good grades without doing any work no work poor grades in his class
1949,Robert  Christie,professor christie is a good professor he has an old school mentality but you learn a lot in his class if you are lazy you might as well not take this class you will be challenged in this class in the long run you will feel more confident and your public speaking skills will increase dramatically
1950,Robert  Christie,warning dont take him extreamly inconsiderate person allow you to go to the bathroom treats students like they are in highschool makes his class out to be best devry has i also have to say that i never worked so hard in a devry class to end up with the grade he gave me his class is an elective for sake
1951,Robert  Christie,fun class nice professor but his grading policy is all over the board no consistency
1952,Robert  Christie,comes prepared mixes up teaching methods between videos fun exercises and to know exercises very patient the only bad grades i know he gave out were for people who skipped class tests are a bit tricky need to study well
1953,Robert  Christie,i know that prof christie gets a bad rap from a lot of people but the man is a hardcore instructor who truly gets the best out of students who work hard those who want an easy instructor avoid the man those who enjoy a challenge get him
1954,Robert  Christie,i had him for a humanities class a few years age he is not an understanding professor grades very hard and gives extremely difficult exams
1955,Kenneth  Riegle,if you want santa to give you a lesson take this class one of the toughest classes taken at uci only because you have to do lots of work outside of class he talks to us like we know the material because its trivial to him there is a lot to memorize powerpoints and study guide are useless just record lecture go to class study hard
1956,Kenneth  Riegle,test was easy but lot to learn though and he seems to do all he can to make learning hard ppt are slides each blank deleted book figures the rest are outlines ditto for study guide loves to make new names for things and teaching things not in book ie he puts z membrane on the study no explaination turned out to be zline
1957,Kenneth  Riegle,class is pretty interesting but like others have said he wants to cover way too much i learned a lot but that was because i worked hard in the class one of the hardests classes for a bio major but also one of the most interesting
1958,Kenneth  Riegle,he wants to cover too much stuff in this class because of this in addition to the lecture material you have to master the bones and muscles without a throrough review in class lecture was interesting and fun but the powerpoint slides arent descriptive and neither is the study guide suffice to say i read the book and used wikipedia alot
1959,Kenneth  Riegle,he is one of the worst prof at uci he speeds thru lecture notes and doesnt explain anything the book was the only thing that helped me pass the class it is pointless to go to lecture because he goes so fast you wont be able to write anything i did not like him at all try to avoid taking this class it takes alot of time and energy
1960,Kenneth  Riegle,i personally did not like his teaching style powerpoint slides are not very helpful he just lists key terms i had to rely heavily on the book because he spoke very quickly in lecture very helpful tip if you have to take him make sure you record all lectures most of his exams are out of what he says in class
1961,Kenneth  Riegle,come on people agreat professor he comments about how he believe they pay him to teach a subject he loves so much he easy but he is certianly fair
1962,Kenneth  Riegle,i learned so much in this class and it helped me in all subsequent classes i would highly recommend taking it before physiology especially because it is imperative to have a basic understanding of the body before trying to figure out how it works
1963,Kenneth  Riegle,riegle is awesome.he has a great interest in relating the material to stuff you learned in other classes.do the study guide and do fine.the tests questions are right out of lecture he pretty much tells you the essay question
1964,Kenneth  Riegle,what do you expect people human anatomy is no picnic professor riegle is good and he looks like santa claus that cool
1965,Kenneth  Riegle,professor riegle is a really great professorhe explains everything clearly and sometimes he can be even funny.i understand why those people wrote such negative evaluations.if you stick to the information required in the study guide and do all of the study questions you will do fine
1966,Kenneth  Riegle,without a doubt the worst bio prof ever had
1967,Kenneth  Riegle,anatomy take this class at a community college where you can get lab credit too a waste of your time to take it with reigle if you happen to take his class pay a lot of attention to detail memorize everything slides notes etc
1968,Kenneth  Riegle,this guy talks too fast his lecture notes are horrendously and the class is very poorly organized he really should go back to that community college really from
1969,Kenneth  Riegle,it would be a major big mistake for anyone who is enrolled in this poor excuse for a professor he quietly mumbles speedily his lectures as if talking to himself to take up time unorganized powerpoint slides his lectures are like impromptu
1970,Anthony  Zoccolilo,everything professor zoccolillo says is admirable one of my favorites is about living in a world where our lives and our assumptions about each other intersect and yes crash and how we live and love and hurt and hate each otherand ourselves
1971,Anthony  Zoccolilo,fair on grading but tests and exams are not from the lectures heavy on the textbook good lectures tho
1972,Anthony  Zoccolilo,great professor very passionate about his work and genuinely cares for his students his lectures are intriguing and thoughtprovoking he has a fun personality which makes his class all the more enjoyable there is certainly a lot of writing to do and his tests are challenging open notes though but not open book so pay attention in class
1973,Anthony  Zoccolilo,he is the best his lectures were always interesting and his assignments were very creative the term paper assignment was excellent and included a perfectly selected film which made it very enjoyable definitely miss his class
1974,Anthony  Zoccolilo,i had professor zoccolilo for the online psyc110 class he made the class very interesting he asks questions and gives assignments that get you to thinking his grading is very fair i would love to have him for another subject
1975,Anthony  Zoccolilo,great guy really into what he teaches he actually used ecollege unlike other professors highly recommend him for any class he teaches
1976,Anthony  Zoccolilo,i suggest taking his class because he is a fair grader and very hot hot hot
1977,Anthony  Zoccolilo,i looked forward to having this class every week everything he has to say is interesting and meaningful the movies he shows for this class are selected with a great deal of research which is evident by reading his manuscript and this is a class that anyone would
1978,Anthony  Zoccolilo,always well prepared entertaining and educational always learned something and was never bored lots of writing assignments but tests are open notes but hard come to class do the work you will get an a
1979,Anthony  Zoccolilo,very cool teacher quick responses when emaile great modivator interesting topics for discussion very open to opinions that dont match his top teacher
1980,Anthony  Zoccolilo,very knowledgable man i found his lectures interesting especially when i had him for psychology tests are multiple choice cool guy who can crack a joke every once in a while
1981,Anthony  Zoccolilo,explains topics very clearly and seems to be knowledgable about psychology the class was very interesting
1982,Anthony  Zoccolilo,i loved his lectures he made the class and material very interesting
1983,Anthony  Zoccolilo,no comments
1984,Anthony  Zoccolilo,he takes things a little too serious after all it is a technology school he needs to lighten up a little and cut the students some slack i missed one hw and got a b instaed of an a very weak
1985,Anthony  Zoccolilo,nice guy lectures are a snooze but if you study you will do well requires a term paper just be ready to do some work i dont hate him but not in love either
1986,George  Curry,remains well versed in knowledge but has become burdened with fund raising outreach and departmental issues which occupy a majority of his time instead of teaching
1987,George  Curry,prof curry is a great teacher he knows his material inside and out and will help you with anything i can say nothing bad about the man one of the best teachers ever had
1988,George  Curry,loved this course and learned soo much but how come he never responded to emails a fun teacher and loves what he does it shows however he is stressed and often times want to be bothered
1989,George  Curry,no comments
1990,George  Curry,no comments
1991,George  Curry,no comments
1992,George  Curry,no comments
1993,George  Curry,no comments
1994,Scott  Bergeson,whether or not you like him will depend on your style dr b gives a lot of hw and tests frequently this is actually helpful because you get a lot of opportunities to make corrections to your grade or tests total of which are in class with a group he talks a lot and often finish lecture so prepare to spend time in the ta help lab
1995,Scott  Bergeson,physics is a really hard course because of the department i usually rate my professors but even though this class was so hard for me cuz no physics major he really is one of the greatest professors he cares about his students brillant definitely worth taking the class from put in extra time outside of lecture
1996,Scott  Bergeson,taking physics from anyone else would be a mistake
1997,Scott  Bergeson,this class kept me going through the physics major he made it so fun and helped us all to understand so well he cares about his students so thoroughly and works so hard to help his students want to learn and succeed
1998,Scott  Bergeson,dr bergeson is the best professor ever had goofy and eccentric and keeps his lectures entertaining and somehow learned almost all of the names of every student in each of his student classrooms he teaches the material simply and tests on what taught us in class nothing came as a surprise ever very accessible
1999,Scott  Bergeson,a great professor for a great class if you do all the work and study sufficiently for the test an easy a dr bergeson is really good and explaining things and making lecture interesting
2000,Scott  Bergeson,definitely take physics from him he actually cares about the students and does everything he can to make sure you learn he also cares about your grade so he punish you for not knowing how to do everything and gives you several chances to learn the tests hard just study and do the homework and get a good grade
2001,Scott  Bergeson,i dreaded physical science before the semester started i never would have guessed it would end up being my favorite class i really appreciate how this class broadened my understanding of science and how the material was clear but also challenged my mind i learned a lot i laughed a lot like a lot and really going to miss this class
2002,Scott  Bergeson,good if you are prepared to take responsibility for your learning and review a lot outside of class
2003,Scott  Bergeson,dr bergeson is a fantastic professor he is able to teach difficult subjects in a gripping way he cares about his students and knew a substantial amount by name in a class with students lectures are interesting and despite first appearance the vigorous testing and homework schedule is actually very manageable
2004,Scott  Bergeson,i loved him he requires for an a but because his teaching style makes it so possible no curve he has short quizzes sometimes in groups rather than large tests a few short homeworks per week and iclicker questions in class that are participationbased does everything he knows how in order to help his students truly learn
2005,Scott  Bergeson,solid fella science made entertaining
2006,Scott  Bergeson,physical science is known as a hard course but taking it from professor bergeson made things clearer definitely go to a lab because your ta could save your bacon if you understand a concept because the midterms rely on concepts that can be applied to different situations get the book and keep up on readings so things make sense in lecture
2007,Scott  Bergeson,professor bergeson is an entertaining lecturer and his class is set up to help you succeed at physics you will have to learn some of the material yourself as not everything is covered in lecture go to the ta lab if you are stuck
2008,Scott  Bergeson,dr bergeson is a great professor and lecturer it was in a large class but still individualized it by letting students ask questions and help with examples the lectures are based on enhancing the textbook reading so if you read the book be great
2009,Scott  Bergeson,i clickers homework every night test every two weeks assigned readings that have nothing to do with physics besides justifying his teaching schedule but he is really passionate imagine vlad the impaler for gym trainer gonna get results but gonna but gonna hurt taking this class because you have to take vlad
2010,Scott  Bergeson,dr b is very funny lectures are entertaining the material is pretty straight forward but test one about every two weeks can be tough the homework is primarily calculation based but tests are mostly conceptual expect any curve or extra credit overall dr is a good professor
2011,Scott  Bergeson,honestly such a sweet guy and genuinely cares about his students however his tests get more and more difficult as the semester goes on and he seems to be teaching less and less relevant material be prepared to do a lot of the learning on your own
2012,Scott  Bergeson,dr bergeson is amazing his lectures are entertaining as well as helpful his tests are pretty tough though they can have tricky questions but mostly because not very many questions so if you miss a few you end up with a b or c on the test which ends up dropping your grade is an a
2013,Scott  Bergeson,i am terrible at physics i got a b in physics from hess but i got an a in this class and it was one of the most accomplishing grades i have ever achieved he is hilarious and lectures will keep you entertained i spent almost every day in the physics tutor lab and it paid off lectures are only mandatory for attendance iclicker points
2014,Guy  King,professor king makes this class easy to pass as long as you do the reading answer the study guide questions and take the quizes and final exam cumulative there are no lectures for this class
2015,Guy  King,professor king makes it easy for his students he gives weekly quizes and one cumulative final exam at the end there are study guides to help prepare students for the quizes final exam
2016,Guy  King,great online class good teacher who responded to concerns fairly well for being an online class class was easy but you had to put in work for the weekly assignments the reading was interesting and quizzes were not too hard
2017,Guy  King,this online class is extremely easy to get an a in and still manages to be very interesting as the assignments and textbook are wellwritten and enjoyable i encourage you to get as much from the course as you can dr guy is very helpful and fast to respond
2018,Guy  King,i took this class online and it was really easy you read the book complete the assignment do a quiz once a week then the final test questions are from the assignments he is also very responsive if you need help
2019,Guy  King,literally the easiest class you will ever take weekly quizzes that are based off of readings easy to get and the final is all of the quizzes combined everything is online kind of sad he gets paid to teach this class when he doesnt do anything
2020,Guy  King,took class online do the study guides and you will have no problem with the quizzes or final i found the class to be very interesting and i learned a lot about california the book is outstanding and so was the class
2021,Guy  King,very nice man fair grader responsive to questions at first i thought the class would be boring but it was interesting do the study guides
2022,Guy  King,this was an online class there were twice weekly study guides using the text book and interesting websites and twice weekly quizzes plus the final answer all the questions on the study guides and you will have no trouble with the tests the answers are all easy to find i found the class interesting and informative
2023,Guy  King,i took his sosc class online and it was great it was very straightforward everything came from the textbook it was an easy a for me and he was always helpful and emailed back right away
2024,Guy  King,easy if you answer all his study guides one paper required regarding writing about a national park open test and if you answer all the questions on the study guide you should get an a in the class
2025,Guy  King,this is my time taking an online class with mr king every week you read a chapter look up information online and take a quiz there is also a final paper very easy if you do the work because the quiz questions match the worksheet you complete the final is taken from the quizzes so save all your quiz answers in word and search
2026,Guy  King,guy lets you know exactly what he expects at the beginning of the semester his class is structured so well that there are no surprises you take one quiz every week based on a study guide that he provides weekly as long as you do well the study guide and quizzes you will do great had him for sosc and got an a too
2027,Guy  King,really enjoyed this professor very professional demeanor interesting topics fair
2028,Guy  King,easy class but the guy is a complete ass
2029,Guy  King,the class was boring and he was boring tests hard overall i think i have any impression of him
2030,Guy  King,sometimes his tests are easy ans sometimes they his lectures are horrible he is extremely boring and know how to teach if you want to learn anything take him
2031,Guy  King,decent intoduction to geography have a problem with the class he would sometimes get sidetracked during lectures lectures seemed to directly follow the text book took this class many years ago and remember much else
2032,Guy  King,dr king is intelligent and humorous his anecdotes apply geography to the real world instead of just teaching out of the textbook if you come to class and study for the tests you will be rewarded with respect and an excellent grade
2033,Guy  King,he is a horrible teacher and kinda creepy we never once looked at a map and it was a geography class
2034,Debra  Clarke,great teacher and always ready to help you if you can put in efforts
2035,Debra  Clarke,debra is a good teacher she is going to help you if you are putting efforts never miss her any class because she always teach something interesting and important

2039,Debra  Clarke,a greaat teacher eventhough i failed in her course but her class was really easy i failed in this course because i missed alot of quizes and assignment however she is a good teacher strongly

2056,Leah  Kaser,no comments
2057,Irv  Englander,currently taking this class englander is an excellent professor the material is hard but if you pay attention its really not that bad tests are challenging but you can bring a page of notes and he is generous with points i definitely recommend taking a class with irv worked with computers since they were invented and he knows his stuff
2058,Irv  Englander,taught that class like you already knew what he was talking about and i was silly enough to think that i take classes to learn the material in them tried several times to go to his office hours but he was never there sent him multiple emails but he never responded would strongly recommend never taking this professor
2059,Irv  Englander,to counter the prior comment then i think if one shows up at lectures reads the book and actually takes time to understand the material then one can do well i ended up with a good grade prof englander is very knowledgeable and i recommend his course if you actually want to learn things but for a free ride then this course is not the one
2060,Irv  Englander,you have been warned impossible material impossible assignments impossible exams i am a cis major and im telling anyone who is considering taking irv dont do it you will fail
2061,Irv  Englander,first it is a joke so it really matter englander is a funny guy and you have to do much for his it workshops just get an on the final and a guaranteed
2062,Irv  Englander,irv has worked at bentley since the and it shows classes so bad but his exams are take this class unless a cis major and even then consider waiting until irv retires he states rather be working at mit and how dull students are these days
2063,Irv  Englander,went to mit and knows his stuff a goofy little guy that you take too seriously a great and fun prof if you just get to know him definately go to office hours and help you out but you may get stuck watching youtube videos with him class is hard but really just put a full worth of study in b4 the exam and youll b fine
2064,Irv  Englander,my favorite professor so far you have to read but you will learn more in this class than anything you have taken at bentley this is not a class that you take as a fluff course though he expects you to work hard and his tests show that expectation
2065,Irv  Englander,no labs and no assignments which makes learning linux challenging keeping good notes is imperative as he imparts all of his knowledge to you via lecture this is an advanced class and you are on your own for developing handson practice strategies and methods i did learn a lot though
2066,Irv  Englander,taken irv for and teaches you more than anyone needs to know he laughs at his own jokes and is a little awkward learned a lot from both classes and received a in both
2067,Irv  Englander,probably the worst cis class taken while the subject is great irv teaches it in a way only for those that already know linux and are extreme geeks i had a cis and overall gpa and somehow ended up with a c in this class irv also hardly teaches as all that you learn is from reading the book and doing your own thing in linux
2068,Irv  Englander,irv is a cool guy if you are a cs major or are just into computers be prepared for difficult tests but he grades on a curve you will without a doubt learn a lot in this class
2069,Irv  Englander,easy class if you know some stuff about computers
2070,Irv  Englander,yeah his class is tough but he grades on a curve a lot and probably end up getting much higher grades than you expected he knows what he teaches is hard so willing to help you not to screw your grades up in the end read the book although his book is hard to read too and make sure to get good scores on assighments
2071,Irv  Englander,extremely hard class class on the the three exams were and grades assignments easily and scales final grades a good amount you will need to read a lot but in the end you will learn so much
2072,Irv  Englander,monotone voice hard three quizzes two exams one final but easy projects weights assignments ie quizzes final smart hard and knows his stuff so if you want to learn take him but if you want it
2073,Irv  Englander,these is without a doubt one of the worst classes i have he tells us to read the book for the quizzes then never puts that info on the quizzes grades projects and what not easily but its hard to get good test and quiz grades good luck with this guy
2074,Irv  Englander,yeah i actually talked to another it101 teacher and found out teaching stuff that necessarily needed for the course awful says that if you study do well but he words questions on quizzes to confuse you hard to do well in this class take whitcomb or someone else because englander is not helpful
2075,Irv  Englander,run for your life do not take him ever
2076,Irv  Englander,this class is the worst it class you can ever take do not take this class unless you want to be a computer geek
2077,Husam  Quereshi,i got a b i got a b for the first time in my life i understood math prof quereshi is very helpful take him if you have a very difficult time with numbers just be sure to do homework and ask questions if you need help yey quereshi
2078,Husam  Quereshi,a really nice teacher he gives a lot of examples during lecture which helps your understanding a lot homework quizzes and exams are easy
2079,Husam  Quereshi,prof quereshi is the best math teacher ever had struggled with algebra before but with him i found it really easy awesome professor funny and also approachable just do your homework and keep your green sheet handy and be fine the best math professor ever had
2080,Husam  Quereshi,quereshi is a funny teacher take his class if you are looking to pass math i hate math but he made it not so bad
2081,Husam  Quereshi,great teacher he has an accent but you can still understand him very funny aswell easy just do your classwork and homework and set
2082,Husam  Quereshi,pretty easy teacher if you want an easy a get him but beware his english is not good
2083,Husam  Quereshi,i enjoyed this class because mr qureshi is intelligent and using humor to teach intermediate algebra known for saying this is a beautiful equation and you are a good student
2084,Husam  Quereshi,this professor is quite possibly the best taken so far english is definitely his lang but his teaching is better than all the other teachers i have taken so far he grades extremely fair and if your motivated there is no reason why you get an a in his class he is not confusing and easy to understand
2085,Husam  Quereshi,great teacher that s all abut him not but he deserved a from me
2086,Husam  Quereshi,this guy does not speak english and is very hard to understand you have to spend more time trying to understand what he says then what he is actually teaching
2087,Husam  Quereshi,he was a great math teacher and his enthusiasm for math really showed i woils warn future students his accent makes him hard to understand it took me about two weeks to be able to understand him
2088,Husam  Quereshi,honestly i am appalling at this professor is great and makes the class really fun he is really helpful and understanding and is prepared to take time to go through the problems and help you get the highest grade you can
2089,Husam  Quereshi,mr qureshi is very clear and precise he clearly enjoys math and really wants to help you understand and love it too extremely funny and playful when it comes to numbers unless you come to class and care about getting a good grade you should get an a
2090,Husam  Quereshi,honestly i need sometime to understand what he said because he got pretty strong accent but it a problem to listen later on most of the test are mc and even final the questions are straight forward what u need to do is just keep up with his though he did not really check it lol then u would not have any problem in class
2091,Husam  Quereshi,super funny and that makes the class very clear when he talks math but sometimes hard to understand him when speaking plain english i hate boring math teachers and not even close to being boring
2092,Husam  Quereshi,great class patient teacher class is pretty easy and if your having trouble following the class he is more than willing to assist you even during you wont have any regrets taking his class and his accent is not a hindurance in your studies
2093,Husam  Quereshi,very handsome class a bit challenging in the summer but great teacher to have taken it with
2094,Husam  Quereshi,i had a d in the same subject that i took in previous quarter this proffessor might seem funny but his way of teaching is extreemly good.he makes sure that u get what he is trying to teach u very good teacher
2095,Husam  Quereshi,mr quereshi is awesome he was easy i never understood what he was saying but also from an area in which people only speak english he really tries to make you understand he is pretty funny and has a great personality he never responds to emails though if you can take him
2096,Husam  Quereshi,he understand english that well he only has one hour a week office hours to help all of his students he reply in emails and he does not grade fairly do not take this teacher especially if not strong in math skills
2097,Burkard  Eberlein,quite good proffesor
2098,Burkard  Eberlein,dr eberlein is smart and can lead an interesting discussion
2099,Burkard  Eberlein,boring like class was a waste of time too
2100,Burkard  Eberlein,he is intelligent brilliant clearly an academic he really believes in what he is teaching and really cares about his students he listens to suggestions responds quickly to email provides good feedback and is just an overall nice guy hes def an introvert give him a lecture or before he opens up he has a lot to offer so go to class
2101,Burkard  Eberlein,no comments
2102,Burkard  Eberlein,great prof too bad not at york permanently every student should have a chance to take a course with him
2103,Burkard  Eberlein,overall a good prof he tends to be monotonous and is somewhat hard on marking however he is very intelligent his notes are very good and he is very helpful to students make sure to study his notes for exams
2104,Burkard  Eberlein,nice enough guy extremely intelligent and good lecture notes but his actual lectures are quite dry he talks in a monotone voice and it is kind of easy to drift off
2105,Burkard  Eberlein,too tough on marking and i thnkhe just marks papers at time so that they fall into some type of marking spectrum he wishes to achieve unpredictable marker i even think he knows what he thinks is type work other than marking and getting a disapointing grade an ok prof
2106,Burkard  Eberlein,he is a great teacher and he really knows his stuff he is not boring at all quite interesting actually i really enjoy being in his class
2107,Burkard  Eberlein,he knows his stuff maybe a bit too demanding
2108,Burkard  Eberlein,boring boring boring
2109,Burkard  Eberlein,yes very boring
2110,Burkard  Eberlein,boring
2111,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,i regret taking her class so many better professors at york in my opinion i really do think there are many more qualified professors at the institution than her to be also found her class really boring a decent person over all though
2112,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,good prof hard class
2113,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,she asks more questions than she answers and she sometimes lectures on material that is irrelevant to the course however her lectures are still interesting and informative plus her exams are ridiculously easy
2114,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,this professor rests at the top of my list not because i finished her course with an but it is because of the passion that drives her to do what she does she uses powerpoint and other forms of multimedia to materialize theoretical abstractions she comes off intimidating at first but she is great once you get to know her her exams great
2115,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,ananya is clearly passionate about her research and this shines through she does ask a lot of questions but only to engage students she provides you with a critical lense to think but sometimes her bias comes through but she deny that she is bias good prof
2116,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,i agree with the above comment that this class teach you anything new it reiterates the same material from previous pols classes the prof asks way too many questions but she makes her lectures concise and to the point
2117,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,lecture moves like a slug teaching style is mundane lecture seems like a seminar she is kind of rude snobbyish stays on the same point for long periods of time she asks too much of the class in terms of questions you can tell what going to say before she says it
2118,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,wily untrustworthy thinks she knows a lot but
2119,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,great proff clear helpful and methodical but too many readings per class other than that she does a great job i would give her an a overall
2120,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,no comments
2121,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,unless you desperatly need an easy a i do not recommend this course unfortunatly there is no category listed here i can criticize her on the course is ridiculously easy and boring it teach you anything that you should not already know neoliberal this bad for democracy that wto this bank that
2122,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,worst prof at york
2123,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,wicked instructor y the hell did she have to leave us midway through the year though it cost me my a her tests are hilariously easy trust me whatever you think of them just hold it in and write them and be happy it could be worst trust me i appreciated her way more after she left
2124,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,great professor always engaging the class in discussion provides lots of extra resources online very approachable and fair the material in this class as interesting as her approach to itshe really tried to help us see differing perspectives on different issues
2125,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,extremely lively and makes class interesting
2126,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,no comments
2127,Ananya  Mukherjee Reed,no comments
2128,Mason  Dykstra,mason was soo funny i love his sense of humor and he had a great dog when i visted him in his office hours and outside the building he had hours in it said no dogs allowed it was fantastic
2129,Mason  Dykstra,not very interesting very much a nerd who really ruined a fun class and made me lose interest he likes to ramble about nonsense and his are half retarded although hot i would not recommend this guy not qualified
2130,Mason  Dykstra,ruined a fun class very boring which is opposite to geo catastrophes lectures are organized and on powerpoint however
2131,Mustafa  Karakul,the prof is ok the material is easy but not the tests huge amount of easy calculation in short time and you need show them in details are not easy even the tests are very straight forward the marker is a litter bit tough you must attend to tutorial if you want good mark the ta give your hint of exam
2132,Mustafa  Karakul,boring professor that creates hard midterm
2133,Mustafa  Karakul,dedicate at least a day to doing problems per chapter the exams too difficult but they are tricky so you need to know your stuff a good prof practice the problems he posts at the end of lectures and pass go to tutorials for extra practice questions and get at least a b i stress go to tutorials if you can
2134,Mustafa  Karakul,good prof read the text and do practice questions and you will be fine
2135,Mustafa  Karakul,dean for test paper everything u confused he can explain clearly he is a humourous guy and always sign for attendants for some special miss the class at the midtime course is not that hard focus on details and tricks on the calculation he prepared
2136,Mustafa  Karakul,be ready to teach yourself prepare you
2137,Mustafa  Karakul,the way of his teaching makes stats easier and simpler
2138,Mustafa  Karakul,excellent professor tells u exactly what will come up on the midterm and final assignments are straight forward the course is not that hard and he makes it even easier getting an a is not so hard provided you do weekly practice of the questions good luck
2139,Mustafa  Karakul,simply amazing if you do poorly in his course you have nobody to blame but yourself he teaches the material very well sticking to the textbook with full answers online also the exam questions were often variations of ones we had already through together in class
2140,Mustafa  Karakul,take this course after taking adms it is very easy because of the material is covered in adms the prof is good as long as u do your work which means do not leave anything till the last second assignment is worth and difficult final mid term are alright i.e not very difficult attend all lectures.overall a good experience
2141,Mustafa  Karakul,great professor take his course without any consideration do something at home and you ll be fine
2142,Mustafa  Karakul,hard marker and expects way too much
2143,Mustafa  Karakul,he is a good prof with a great sense of humour he covers topics well and gives detailed explanations with a lot of examples best thing is to read his slides and the textbook for problems when it comes to exams and quizzes
2144,Mustafa  Karakul,outstanding prof i hate to repeat what everyone else is saying but i have to say he really does have a great teaching style and he sincerely cares about his students
2145,Mustafa  Karakul,one of the best teachers ever had has a wonderful teaching style that makes going to class very worthwhile he truly cares about the performance of his students also a very funny guy
2146,Mustafa  Karakul,i see some of the older ratings say too quick and too many notes i took operations mngmt with him and i dont remember writing down more than lines in any given class he has office hours two times a weeks which is great and he knows the field inside out which is great if interested in it further only good things to say
2147,Mustafa  Karakul,mr karakul really knows how to teach he does not care about the stuff that the students do not need fair in grading everything was prescheduled quizzes assignments exams examviewings i really enjoyed this course just study before the exams enough overall very good
2148,Mustafa  Karakul,awesome guy had a great time in his class learned alot and he is extremely efficient in getting papers marked and returned hes really helpful if your stuck and is extremely approachable would definately take another class with him
2149,Mustafa  Karakul,this prof is really smart and he is a really good marker and he is super helpful
2150,Mustafa  Karakul,he is a great professor pleasure to be in his class
2151,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,tough gradrer
2152,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,would not recommend anyone to take his online course according to hassan as far as i know this course has never audio or vedio lectures because they are not developed by the departmentschool so we have to read the text book and then post any questions on any concept or methods i will address it ta worked pretty hard
2153,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,big accent
2154,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,i kinda like this professor i can feel that he is trying so hard to make the students understand everything the bad thing is hes kinda short tempered but he did it because he cares for his students take another courses with him in the future
2155,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,what a guy so helpful and nice if you go to his office hours and show that you care try his best to help you out thank you hassan for the great semester
2156,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,anyone who says the prof is not helpful probably they ask for help prof hassan is very helpful and caring he omitted one of the required assignments so we can increase our marks.midterm a killer it required someone who study overall take another class with him
2157,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,took his online course worst experience so far in university year offers no help and doesnt provide proper info on anything first assignment was the most vague piece of everyone i showed as ever seen shame on york for hiring him to educate the new was of statisticians and business people
2158,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,in my last year at york and have made it this far without submitting a professor rating does not answer emails does not offer help unclear arrogant condescending switch sections or good luck
2159,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,never responded to emails and never explained himself was never available or helpful
2160,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,do not take internet section with him the course is easy especially if u have studied adms he does not gives any feedback about the assignments and mid terms when i emailed him for his office hours twice he never responded take this course in fall or winter i.e a lecture avoid the internet section overall a bad experience for me
2161,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,i have taken stats before at another uni and had to take it again at york i decided to take the online course hassan and the ta never respond to questions and when i wanted to discuss my assignment mark he could barely explain to me what i did wrong i really did not like him as a teacher maybe it was just the online aspect
2162,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,big accent
2163,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,dudee u rock no surprises in the exam just practice back of the book question extremely helpfull
2164,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,oh hassan hassan hassan he is an interesting prof he does care for his students and is very enthusiastic about the material covered in class he is quite lenient in his marking and his quizzes are not hard only problem is you have to participate in his class but i actually learnt a lot as a result overall good prof
2165,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,i one of the worst profs i ever encountered whether you study hard or not unfortunately chose the prior option quizes are incomprehensible discussions are irrelevant and half of the articles are complete nonsense that worth reading p.s avoid challenging his opinion he like you
2166,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,he really is a good prof wants to see his students succeed unlike a lot of other profs at york highly recommend him very flexible and very reasonable as long as you do the questions assigned do great theres no surprises two thumbs up
2167,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,he speak good english unfair maker you may not get the grade that you worked hard lazy professor
2168,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,one of the best professors at atkinson this guy really cares about his students is always nice and polite is helpful and fair with marks if you can make a good case not sure who wrote the part about his english but they got it all wrong his english is very good he is one of the few good in atkinson business courses
2169,Hassan  Qudrat-Ullah,although he really speak good actually all i can say is to study hard by yourself but he is always a good prof to seek for help he will provide you as much as possible be afraid to seek help from him

2171,Lorra  Weatherspoon,no comments
2172,Lorra  Weatherspoon,lectures were very clear and classes were interesting prof was very helpful in and out of class
2173,Danilo  Fernando,relies completely on exam grades which can make the class really difficult get the textbook and look over anything he may have skimmed because it seems everything is fair game for his exams he teaches on very specific topics for such a broad course supposed to cover all of plant evolution
2174,Danilo  Fernando,beware of dr fernando as a professor or advisor he does not teach to broad learning styles in students it can be a serious problem for someone who needs to understand plant science taught by him he relies on textbooks when answering questions he was more intolerant and unhelpful than any other teacher i have ever had
2175,Danilo  Fernando,i like his lectures and labs its the exams which i find completely absurd what is emphasized in class is not what is tested on rather there is a very heavy focus on material specifically not emphasized unless you are capable of memorizing every little thing he says you are stuck with a passing but mediocre grade on the exams
2176,Danilo  Fernando,amazing professor
2177,Danilo  Fernando,wonderful professor
2178,Danilo  Fernando,he is an awaesome teacher and i loved the class especially since i love plants to much he is dedicated and very knowledgeable
2179,Danilo  Fernando,really cool guy really hard class
2180,Danilo  Fernando,care for most of the content of the lecture bit too much genetics the lab was very useful and vital to increasing use of biotech
2181,Danilo  Fernando,the nicest guy in the world not the most consice teacher he curves the class big time
2182,Danilo  Fernando,yes a little unclear but is always willing to help
2183,Danilo  Fernando,ouch

2187,Todd  Comer,great guy
2188,Todd  Comer,lots of material bu interesting learned alot
2189,Todd  Comer,absolutely awful prof was a grad student at the time and loaded coursework down on us like crazy very unclear and very tough grader spent my whole summer reading very difficult books
2190,Martha  McCluskey,terrible professor learning latin would be clearer than listening to this lectures she is all over the place and does not explain anything well she gives paragraphs of instructions for an answer she expects to be a few sentences welcome to hell
2191,Martha  McCluskey,horrible teacher her instructions are super long but clear at all one of the worst teachers i have ever had would rather just have a final test instead of written work during the semester
2192,Martha  McCluskey,i took another con law class in undergrad that covered the exact same stuff but mccluskey really butchered the topics she was pretty much incomprehensible so i relied on my undergrad notes for this class she means well and is nice but really deliver
2193,Martha  McCluskey,she is very knowledgable and tries to communicate but something gets lost
2194,Martha  McCluskey,unable to follow a keep a question in mind while answering uses completely ineffective she asks nonsensical questions is a winning con arg circa most reading is not useful and reiterates the same point over and over she listen to student responses in class tries to pick fights run
2195,Martha  McCluskey,i know in the minority but i liked her is very knowledgeable and friendly in the beginning i care for her but she grew on me in the end i realized i learned a lot she tells you exactly what to expect on exams very willing to meet with students
2196,Martha  McCluskey,no comments
2197,Martha  McCluskey,i concur with everyone comments
2198,Martha  McCluskey,mccluskey is the worst law professor ever avoid her at all costs she complete a thought or give a straightforward rule she never answers questions clearly she took an interesting subject and ruined it she makes you stand up when you speak in class and nothing anyone says is ever good enough never hated a class so much in my life
2199,Martha  McCluskey,either very smart or a very good actor but lacks the ability to answer questions or present the issues to allow firstyear law students to comprehend way too much irrelevant reading perhaps she would be better for upperlevel students to answer her questions it is necessary to read her mind run
2200,Martha  McCluskey,the worst professor at ub law a hard grader but fails to have any knowledge of the subject highly irritating
2201,Martha  McCluskey,awful teacher never take a class with her a complete ditz
2202,Martha  McCluskey,horrible i wonder if she even went to law school
2203,Martha  McCluskey,not great but incredibly easy
2204,Martha  McCluskey,arghh what a nightmare
2205,Jon  Vredevoogd,fantastic professor had him for several classes if there were more profs like jon have a phd
2206,Jon  Vredevoogd,exam is difficult but assignments are fun
2207,Jon  Vredevoogd,this professor loves teaching and really wants you to apply the information the class is basically how to use the design principles to better your life and career very motivational and directly useful for any major and the class is an easy as long as you pay attention to the details
2208,Jon  Vredevoogd,this class is really easy as long as you follow the book and practice the exam before you take it before you buy the book make sure your getting the current one and the right class book i accidentally bought the book for ides
2209,Jon  Vredevoogd,a good teacher and is always willing to help you out if you had a problem with something just ask him rely on your mine sucked he is very unorganized but if you follow the book you will be ok
2210,Jon  Vredevoogd,overall this class is easy just need to practice for exams or you will not do well
2211,Jon  Vredevoogd,no comments
2212,Jon  Vredevoogd,no comments
2213,Jon  Vredevoogd,exams are extremely easy but be careful the assignments can screw you over if you follow in instructions exactly he is not helpful at all if you have questions so use allmsu and ask other students
2214,Jon  Vredevoogd,extremely early class but worth it very friendly tests are extremely easy but you need to go to class
2215,William  Addeo,nice man but makes math extremely confusing over half of my class dropped i got an a but it was from studying the book myself and being decent at math already
2216,William  Addeo,thought he was great will take his class anytime very helpful if you know why you are in the class i was unsure of him at first but if you show commitment he works with you takes time to answer your qusetions if understand also gives extra credit got an a
2217,William  Addeo,yes he erases problems fast but he really has a heart if failing he will try to accommodate you if in there the first week and keep up with him drop the class because he gets better
2218,William  Addeo,there is a reason in the dumb math after being out of highschool now for yrs flies thru review like you know it already erases problems before you can copy and work them work problem just asks for answer emailed class to tell them there would be a quiz the day before it was to happen looks lost confused dropped class a.s.a.p
2219,William  Addeo,he gets confused doing his own problems he is virtually inaccessable and he is like late to his own classes
2220,William  Addeo,he was not that difficult of a professor his tests were straight forward and offered extra credit
2221,William  Addeo,no comments
2222,William  Addeo,lets you use fact sheets for every quiz or exam including finals helps a lot
2223,William  Addeo,moves very fast and is hard to follow he erases problems to make room before you can copy them down he cuts class close and skips stuff to finish i had to drop the class because i failed too many quizes after getting a b in the semester before he seems like a nice guy outside of class
2224,William  Addeo,erases example problems before you get a chance to write them down if you ask how to do a problem he looks at the clock claims he have enough time to completely work the problem and just tells you the answer he constantly messes up problems which left you more confused than you were before
2225,William  Addeo,worst teacher ever he doenst want to help anyone and he gets mad when you ask him to explain a problem he doesnt know what he is doing and messes up on example problems drop him now
2226,William  Addeo,no comments
2227,William  Addeo,messes up example problems making it more confusing to and already confused mind
2228,William  Addeo,very hard to understand he also messes up example problems so there is no answer and really confuses you if you get him drop him

2240,Robert  Bender,there are two exams one lowest grade drop the professor opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits
2241,Robert  Bender,r bender is the best financial professor in utd period take him if you want to learn something and pass funny guy and encourages questions i am not a finance guy and the class is challenging but his method of teaching helps a whole lot and helped me take him if you want to live through a finance class
2242,Robert  Bender,best teacher in the school of management knows a lot teaches a lot jokes a lot cares a lot
2243,Robert  Bender,i really liked class he like to be called professor he was really helpful and made things easy to understand most test questions are graded right or wrong but the questions are very similar to the homework and the practice problems in class does things using papers for notes using overhead camera
2244,Robert  Bender,bob is a great professor he is old school and uses an overhead so you pretty much have to go to class because he does not utilize elearning except to post the syllabus if you go to class and pay attention he gives you every opportunity to make an a he thoroughly explains everything and does several practice problems in class take him
2245,Robert  Bender,his exam questions all came from the example problems in class you knew what to expect on the exam easy a if you attend class and rework the examples his passion for finance and his jokes every now and then made the class enjoyable considering finance
2246,Robert  Bender,i doubt for a minute most of those posts about his great sense of humor and how a good professor he is were posted by the same bender he uses the projector to show old sheets he probably has been using for the last years som should pride to have a real good professor for this core class his jokes were probably funny years ago
2247,Robert  Bender,best finance professor ever he knows his work and teaches it with a passion funny and really cares about his students he sometimes brings donuts to class highly recommend him
2248,Robert  Bender,great teacher highly recommended i always go to class but you can really get behind if you doing the homework really helps to get in gear for the tests the tests bad except the final which he has no control over and which i felt completely unprepared for however he gives a mighty curve for it
2249,Kathleen  Sinning,one of my hardest classes yet she grades tough but is pretty fair make sure you go to class for the in class problems as well as doing the take home problems she knows a lot about her field she ended up curving our overall grade even though she does not curve tests
2250,Kathleen  Sinning,this by far one of the most knowledgeable professors wmu has her class was tough and she makes you work for it but if you go to class and actually study the in class notes you wrote that is exactly what is on the exam btw you will pass and more importantly learn probably wont get an a though do no buy the book do not buy the book
2251,Kathleen  Sinning,she is one of the best professors had at wmu she really knows her lectures and is extremely knowledgeable of her subject she is helpful and very respectful her tests are difficult so you will need to study a lot you can buy the book for practice problems but not mandatory i got an a and never bought the book
2252,Kathleen  Sinning,she is super awesome
2253,Kathleen  Sinning,awesome teacher the class is hard and there is a lot of material but if you go to class and take notes you will be fine she knows everything
2254,Kathleen  Sinning,she is an awesome prof her notes are so easy to miss a class or you will miss a lot of material and she does a good job of explaining the inclass handouts tests are all short answer so make sure you know your stuff because most of the points lost will be because of the lack of explanation highly recommend
2255,Kathleen  Sinning,greatest teacher ever so clear so precise i wish she could teach every class ever have to take there is no greatest prof not only on campus but in the whole country i am sure
2256,Kathleen  Sinning,one of the most knowledgeable professors i have ever had tests are very difficult but you can study for them write down everything she says because you will see it again miss a class because you will miss a lot of material if you work hard you will do well
2257,Kathleen  Sinning,dr sinning is wonderful she sent me pageslong emails with explanations whenever i contacted her with questions and is available outside of office hours if you need it no doubt this is a tough class but if you work hard and ask for help you will be fine miss class or you miss out on a lot
2258,Kathleen  Sinning,hard class impossible to remember everything so boring you have to study a ton to get an a
2259,Kathleen  Sinning,buy the book awesome teacher
2260,Kathleen  Sinning,you would be hard pressed to find anything negative about dr sinning you will learn more in this class than in any other class she has been teaching at wmu for over years and instead of being lazy and reaping the benefits she has only kept improving on the quality of teaching amazing professor wmu is lucky to have her grading very fair
2261,Kathleen  Sinning,dr sinning may be the best accounting professor at wmu she helps you learn more than you could ever think of if you are going into tax for a career you will be very happy you had her at the end of the semester you will have a solid understanding of basic tax she does demand that you work hard though grading is very fair go to class
2262,Kathleen  Sinning,dr sinning rocks my world she has the patience of a nun this woman is a saint a total blessing to wmu students are lucky to have her teaching god bless this woman the best professor i have ever had my only gripe is that she give enough room on the exams to work out problems you have to write really small oh well dr sinning rocks
2263,Kathleen  Sinning,best teacher you do not need the book if there even is one she gives you handouts does great examples study all of your notes and you will do find tests are short she def knows her stuff even if you failed her class you would want to take her again she is great
2264,Kathleen  Sinning,value added western is lucky to have her dr sinning is easily one of the best professors i have ever had hand down she makes the subject crystal clear and is extremely helpful if you have any problems almost clairvoyant and talk about professional even if you studying accounting you should take her tax class thank you dr sinning
2265,Kathleen  Sinning,i love this class she grades very difficult and requires you to give explanations on everything for the tests she explains everything very well though and will answer any question you have about tax crystal clear
2266,Kathleen  Sinning,dr sinning is wonderful she cares read the notes golden must attend class to take notes do not buy the textbook
2267,Kathleen  Sinning,prof sinning is awesome she makes tax accounting much more understandable than reading the book my advice do not buy the book and go to class all of the time warning she will throw information into tests that you have never seen before to trip you up so be careful make sure that you know her notes all of them or you will fail
2268,Kathleen  Sinning,one of the best instructors at western very professional
2269,Robert  Dinero,hard grader but overall funny interesting and knowledgeable teacher
2270,Robert  Dinero,not fun not recommended at all you can take the same class learn just as much and not have a nightmare semester thanks to dinero not helpful not understanding gives no slack class is interesting but he is a
2271,Robert  Dinero,ok the tests are very difficult inclass essay format but overall a good class to take i learned alot about the middle east but dinero def knows his stuff so you have to do the reading very sarcastic but his rants about the president are pretty funny keep you awake in an for sure
2272,Robert  Dinero,he is seriously the worst man alive not helpful very rude and arrogant and does not link topics to class
2273,Robert  Dinero,he is the worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life no joke all he does is criticize rather then teach take my advice and pick his class
2274,Robert  Dinero,ridiculously sarcastic when giving you feedback has taken shots of pure caffeine in the morning to be jumpy during class as he explains and jumps around from topic to topic with no clear relation.thinks he is the smartest man in the world biggestego
2275,Robert  Dinero,no comments
2276,Carole  Waterhouse,loved dr waterhouse so understanding and sweet she really wants us to do our best she made class interesting and always let us leave early as long as we finished the assignments given
2277,Carole  Waterhouse,i took studies in writing as a required course for english ed but this is a creative writing course wrote creative papers which i had never done before she grades easily and pities you if you a creative writing major does not do much during class time besides talk about the books but there are no testsquizzes sweet lady
2278,Carole  Waterhouse,this is a fun class you have to work for an a and much to my group disappointment you have to do work no matter which part of the magazine you work on but you get something awesome to put on your resume
2279,Carole  Waterhouse,she is very nice and caring help you when you need it so far this class has been easy yet full of information i would take her again if i could
2280,Carole  Waterhouse,she is the best
2281,Carole  Waterhouse,where do i begin dr waterhouse has to be the best professor had at calu thus far extremely kind and caring not mention helpful i had her for wednesday night class and she actually made me want to go to class i definitely recommend her to everyone
2282,Carole  Waterhouse,i highly recommend taking your eng with her extremely nice and understanding the class hard at all as long as you follow her instructions always there to help if you are confused only downsides are that she does not post grades on d2l and rarely checks her email
2283,Carole  Waterhouse,fun and nice lady helpful and understanding papers were easy mostly opinion and personal stuff or interviews so it require time consuming research class did kind of drag on sometimes but it was an night class so that happens i would recommend
2284,Carole  Waterhouse,dr waterhouse is a really nice lady who is willing to help you if you need it every english class can be sloe but she tries her best to keep your interest she is not too hard of a grader and i would definitely recommend her for an english class
2285,Carole  Waterhouse,very nice teacher she grades the papers fairly easily and she is pretty helpful as well only complaint is that sometimes class just seems to drag on very boring sometimes but overall i would recommend
2286,Carole  Waterhouse,waterhouse was great she is very nice and very helpful granted it is english so it obviously is going to be a little slow at times but she tried her hardest to keep students active and interested only had to write papers and take a few tiny quizzes she did ramble on a lot about nothing at times i would absolutely take her again if i could
2287,Carole  Waterhouse,had her for a night class never went the whole time did a lot of creative writing kind of papers only papers and have time to work on them in class i would take her again very help ful
2288,Carole  Waterhouse,very nice extremely easy grader on papers sometimes makes you work on something all class and then do anything with it afterward
2289,Carole  Waterhouse,she is a great teacher she is also a veru nice person and very friendly i learned a lot from her
2290,Carole  Waterhouse,she was a very very nice person and extremely helpful class was never the full time period and she gave a good amount of time for all assignments four papers and class work is graded it is important to go to class i would take her again
2291,Carole  Waterhouse,waterhouse is a very nice person and to be honest you do much work in her class you have to read the plays take notes in class and you will be fine finals and a paper is all your grade consists of but if you work hard you will get a good grade
2292,Carole  Waterhouse,very helpful and good teacher workload was easy and grading was fair i would take her again
2293,Carole  Waterhouse,dr waterhouse was my advisor and a prof she is the most influential prof i had at cal u and she helped me tremendously with my writing
2294,Carole  Waterhouse,retook comp ii after getting an f with another prof and got an a with waterhouse her paper assignments were fun and were allowed to pick topics within chosen career field
2295,Carole  Waterhouse,great intro class i had a laid back night class with her just real pleasant nothing crazy no hitler teaching you just a laid back woman who likes to see you be creative real hard at grading either very nice for this class
2296,Joan  Lobo,outstanding prof the very best
2297,Joan  Lobo,incorrectly posted a grade and inform me until further communication was made this is not a good class to take during the summer the presence of a prof is needed for success
2298,Joan  Lobo,i know why people are so bitter towards this prof actually great gave out in free bonus marks to basically everyone the midterm on the syllabus said chapters she made it easier by only covering chapters and i studied total hrs for midterm and got an a content on tests were directly from textbook and lectures
2299,Joan  Lobo,worst prof avoid her at all costs
2300,Joan  Lobo,would not recommend her modules are completely different from textbook material and very long to get through study the whole textbook yourself exam was not fair at all and she even write it she told us the format right before we took it and you have to pass the exam to pass the course horrible avoid at all costs
2301,Joan  Lobo,this is honestly the worst prof taken in university by far the laziest and irresponsible prof award goes to her minutes before the final exam she told the class things that were never on the online modules or the textbook the modules and textbook were not consistent at all can go on avoid this prof for your sake
2302,Joan  Lobo,horrible prof probably the laziest person to teach personal finance final was tough provide proper feedback to questions and worst of all leaves it all on you do not take this class ever
2303,Joan  Lobo,useful online course that explains some of the basics of personal financial planning joan was fair and clearly defined all expectations for this course quizzes midterm and final examination were not overly difficult read the text do the chapter problems and review all of the modules before a test and you will be fine
2304,Joan  Lobo,this prof is completely useless i took this course online for only weeks and had to drop it after the first quiz her modules made so much sense however the questions on the quiz were worded so confusingly it was like she wanted everyone to fail horrible prof made an interesting useful course into something hideous and disgusting avoid
2305,Joan  Lobo,not helpful not consistent with what she said would be covered on telling stories not teaching it is supposed to an awesome course with real life information needed and practice the prof is away from it
2306,Joan  Lobo,lazy prof not helpful to tend to questions not consistent with what she said would be covered on
2307,Joan  Lobo,online version highly recommended to take after you finished fin300 many similar mathematical concepts the tests are simple if you do your readings all open book the exam was ridiculously easier than i thought just do the easy practice questions in the textbook and online modules when i met her in person she was extremely friendly
2308,Joan  Lobo,hard marker
2309,Joan  Lobo,useless avoid at all cost had a great deal of interest in finance before this class but she killed it with her unorganized lectures hard marking and questions on exams outside the study material never again mate never
2310,Joan  Lobo,i only took the week online course so there much interaction but modules pinpoint the main concepts quite responsive and course is very easy with her openbook mc midterms and quizzes are fair as long as you read the book and do the problems module exercises very fair final problems and mc gives out bonus marks
2311,Joan  Lobo,good prof explains very well and uses examples from the real world tests are very fair and i did learn alot from the class very good course to take in also she provides bonus marks and it is a good courswe to take to learn some finanacial stuff and for easy good grade
2312,Joan  Lobo,very nice helpful and understanding teacher midterm was hard but final and the overall course was easy highly recommended
2313,Joan  Lobo,basically this teacher is useless her included things we never learned and she makes the questions as confusing as possible when i try to get ask questions she can never explain it clearly the class average was so believe what was written below avoid from a high gpa student
2314,Joan  Lobo,stay away from her neither does she knew the theory nor does she teach well i do not recommend her class at all
2315,Joan  Lobo,pretty good prof midterms are based on the she make you do more than that easy to tell what test you on gives a lot of practical advise but rushes through the class sometimes she kill your gpa i would suggest taking her skip class
2316,Frank  Giarratani,lectures are boring but what else can you expect from introductory econ read the textbook do the weekly online quizzes and try the optional homework assignments because some of the same questions will show up on tests do that and be fine whether you go to lecture or not exams all multiple choice and no cumulative final
2317,Frank  Giarratani,although a nice guy prof g is the worst professor had at pitt he teaches straight from the book and you learn any application which is basically what the tests are went to his office hours many times and find it to be helpful at all he knows what talking about but he sucks at teaching
2318,Frank  Giarratani,good professor for this introductory class the lectures reinforce exactly in the book so attendance really mandatory but he ends early almost every day work through the chapters to answer the weekly true false quizzes and be fine
2319,Frank  Giarratani,i strongly recommend dr giarratani he is a master economist he lectures from the book but he does a fabulous job of explaining the material he also puts his lecture slides online the nonmandatory homework and readings are important for the tests his tests are reasonable and it is easy to do well if you understand the material
2320,Frank  Giarratani,dr giarratani is a department head and an internationally respected economist he might not be the most riveting public speaker but he sure does have a lot of insightful things to say he is a fair grader and has reasonable expectations do the recommended book problems and go to him for help if you need totest questions are often identical
2321,Frank  Giarratani,professor giarratani was an excellent teacher he really knows a lot about econ and has a lot of real world experience which he brings into the classroom he worked with the white house on industrial policy negotiations with the chinese he has a great ability to get students to understand concepts and makes the material very clear
2322,Frank  Giarratani,giarratani is awesome he has a boring voice that is true but he is very passionate about econ and you can really tell he throws in little jokes and stories to help make up for the tone of his voice he explains things really well i would definitely recommend him if you are deciding whether to take honors micro he changes your perspective
2323,Frank  Giarratani,not terribly compelling material to teach but prof giarratani augments it with topics relevant to his lives exams and quizzes are very fair and recommended practice materials seem abundant try to pay attention to lectures though because he may test some details directly from them
2324,Frank  Giarratani,prof g was a good teacher the lectures were mostly a review of the readings but goes in a bit more detail tests are fair and fairly easy if you understand the concepts he is trying to teach
2325,Frank  Giarratani,extremely difficult exams they have nothing to do with the lectures and the wording is incredibly tricky i would recommend taking this course with another professor
2326,Frank  Giarratani,prof lectures were directly out of the book they were a good review of the readings but they tended to get very boring and monotonous he had interesting stories but the majority of the lectures were him reviewing book material his tests are worded in an extremely tricky manner as well
2327,Frank  Giarratani,professor giarratani is one of the best professors had at pitt he has a genuine love of economics and it shows in his teaching all his examples are crystal clear and are applicable to the real world i guarentee even if you are not interested in economics still leave the class feeling more informed and prepared for life after college
2328,Frank  Giarratani,thought i wanted to be an econ major until i took this class some people did well if they made it their entire life but i thought frank was irrelevant and boring his wording is nothing like the book so it was easy to get confused not a great teacher but if you really need the course easy to get a c so take it at pitt
2329,Frank  Giarratani,such a great professor sweet and funny guy loves economics and traveling his voice is sort of boring but he keeps his lectures relevant tests are mostly multiple choice and very realistic big on learning the material instead of testing like crazy loved the class honors section
2330,Frank  Giarratani,prof g keeps things straightforward which works well for the class he is very passionate about the subject and his applications to daily life are interesting if you read and study for the tests they difficult no problem to get an a
2331,Frank  Giarratani,fair class fair teacher attendance is not mandatory as long as you follow the book he is extra boring because of his monotone voice but is still a nice guy
2332,Frank  Giarratani,good professor putting aside his monotone inflection he was an excellent teacher and i enjoyed the course
2333,Frank  Giarratani,good professor for honors micro the tests are pretty easy if you study and keep up with the reading willing to help with anything you have question on not recommended if you fall asleep easily his voice is a bit monotone
2334,Frank  Giarratani,very amusing and funny prof exams are easy if you read all chapters before exam and attend all lectures exam format mc pts ea and applied free resonse problems broken into parts pts ea final format part noncumulative exam same as above part cumulative mc drawn from practice online quizzes identical easy
2335,Frank  Giarratani,frank is a good guy and as long as you follow along in the readings you will do fine tests are conceptbased without many definitions midterms quizzes one final and maybe a small opportunity for extra credit in class no mandatory hw

2354,George  Williams,george williams is one of the greatest guys out there i took many classes with willy g and always found his lectures to be very enjoyable
2355,George  Williams,prof williams ahh what a man a truly unique individual in that you would never know what random thought would pop out during class sometimes difficult to discern what material was being covered in class and his explainations were sometimes as clear as mud not always helpful during office hours but at least he would try to help
2356,George  Williams,where does the go where the allways goes where the danger is where the george is
2357,George  Williams,no comments
2358,Kathleen  Ochshorn,dr ochshorn is such a sweet lady the class is based around essays which are easy as long as you put in a little effort then there are readings due every class with pop quizzes that are easy if you read drops lowest quiz grade lectures can be a bit boring but she always lets you out of class early sweet lady would recommend
2359,Kathleen  Ochshorn,had to read up to pages of boring travel pieces between every class and only had writing assignments no one in the class did all of the reading cause it was a ridiculous amount everyone did poorly on quizzes barely got any feedback on our few assignments horribly boring class not helpful at all still got an a good luck with her
2360,Kathleen  Ochshorn,a wonderful professor she provides a clear outline of the course and sticks to it there are inclass readings and discussions for participation points no exams but a few pop quizzes just read what she says to read research paper is of your grade but she lets you submit drafts and she is there every step of the way if you need her
2361,Kathleen  Ochshorn,she can be rude to students and is a huge stickler for phones out in class and wandering out of the room aka no bathroom breaks if you want the stink eye also huge on arriving on time she takes attendance and if late she scolds you and sometimes gives pop reading quizzes which you take even if a few minutes late
2362,Kathleen  Ochshorn,unreasonable super boring class thinks her class is the only one taking forces you to change things that are perfectly fine
2363,Kathleen  Ochshorn,i took her for fiction shes a great critic and will force you to improve your writing but the class is not too hard she also assigns great readings go to her office hours to work on your stuff with her shes even better oneonone
2364,Kathleen  Ochshorn,she is a good teacher to get for eng there are a lot of readings due for each class and the discussions can be really long and boring she is really nice and helpful though four essays due likes to see lots of changes between drafts go to her office hours too she gives good feedback on papers i would take her again
2365,Kathleen  Ochshorn,small readings due every class not long tho short word essays but she grades them easily she grades on how drastically you change your paper from the draft to the last she really likes a lot of changes no tests finalessay
2366,Kathleen  Ochshorn,i took her for fiction writing i and she was really good attendance is mandatory but she is easy if you have an excuse very nice and helpful but dont take her if your looking to get an easy wri grade or if this isnt for your major you do do alot of writing assignments you have to read a couple short stories for every class overall good teache
2367,Kathleen  Ochshorn,good class she really cares about your grade you get what you earn and do the reading
2368,Kathleen  Ochshorn,this is my favorite professor at ut i loved her anyone who is an english major needs to take her just for the experience she allows you to love the subject without being a jerk about grades i actually learned from her
2369,Kathleen  Ochshorn,excellent professor passionate about her subject
2370,Kathleen  Ochshorn,if you ask questions she acts as if you are stupid and expects you to know the answer rude she may need to stick with regular english and not eng
2371,Kathleen  Ochshorn,no comments
2372,Kathleen  Ochshorn,great professor shes an extremely nice lady and offers to look at your essays before she grades them to point out things you did wrong there are no tests a lot of reading and you have to write five papers all u do in class is pretty much discuss the readings shes a great professor and is extremely nice
2373,Kathleen  Ochshorn,very nice prof and easy class to get a good grade if you do what she asks very easy to talk to and explains things clearly
2374,Kathleen  Ochshorn,very smart and interesting lady
2375,Kathleen  Ochshorn,very nice lady some of the readings can get a little boring at times easy grader very helpful in giving feedback on papers definitely take her for eng102
2376,Kathleen  Ochshorn,awesome very passionate and approachable the class is pretty easy is you do the simple readings the more you participate the better grade guaranteed
2377,Kathleen  Ochshorn,great teacher very nice very helpful i hate english in general but she is a good teacher
2378,Margaret  Sweet,she is kind of a hippie but none the less as long as you attend and are involved you will get a good grade
2379,Margaret  Sweet,she never checks her email and uses outdated information she also needs to grade on more than just attendance i would suggest taking this class because its an interesting topic but not with her
2380,Margaret  Sweet,poitless class learned absolutley nothing attendance is a must dont miss day or you will more then likely fail otherwise class was xtreamly boring and her teaching style is dull
2381,Margaret  Sweet,entirely attendance based no emphasis on knowledge gained and she talks about the exact same thing everyday either you have perfect attendance and you get a or you miss days and get a
2382,Margaret  Sweet,very easy its all in attendance really boring though mid sem exam you take in groups only hard thing is your final paper which she does not go over if you want a take her
2383,Margaret  Sweet,going to the lectures seemed completely pointless she talks about the same things every day and hard to even stay awake i felt like i wasted money and time being in her class and learned hardly anything
2384,Margaret  Sweet,i throughly enjoyed this class attendance is a must i learned alot from her
2385,Margaret  Sweet,if you like kindergarten teachers like her she literally will pull you out of class if missed a day regardless of the circumstances take this class if far from campus or in the winter for that matter because if late your ass show up and the class is mind numbingly easy waste of money
2386,Margaret  Sweet,she was very awesome if you go to class and participate you will do well i never opened the book got a i also got on the final paper she just is extremly nice and helpful i love her
2387,Margaret  Sweet,she was a fairly easy teacher but all she seemed to ever talk about was attachments she did not make the class interesting at all and did not make it very clear what we needed to know for the tests
2388,Margaret  Sweet,very knowledgeable professional peg sets her students up for success she is very helpful and wants her students to really learn about the subject material
2389,Margaret  Sweet,this is the worst teacher i have had in my years as a full time student at l.c.c she is undereducated and asks for class input but if you speak up and agree with her she will embarrass you in front of the class and make you feel stupid she is completely ignorant and the other psych profs i have had at lcc have agreed that she is a bad pro
2390,Margaret  Sweet,she has no idea what talking about a complete bafoon do not take this class it is dull and she is obnoxiously uneducated on the subjects she is supposed to be teaching
2391,Margaret  Sweet,she was a terrible teacher she had a very biased outlook on psychology and all she taught was attachment theory she teach about the proven methods of mental disorder reasons and treatments do not take her unless you want to learn incorrect information and want to be bored out of your mind
2392,Margaret  Sweet,she is a great woman with lots of experience in this field you can know so much new and important stuff in her class just by listening a lot and keeping your mind open the class is not difficult but very interesting i do recommend to take this class and i do recommend margaret she is very knowledgeable and nice
2393,Margaret  Sweet,absolutely the worst professor i have ever had the class was boring to begin with and all based on attendance i aced the entire thing but then when i turned in the paper somehow she gave me a zero because of some big mistake that she made i tried to contact her about my grade and it took her a month to get back with me
2394,Margaret  Sweet,did not like her one of the worst teachers ever had very boring class and waste your money buying the book because never use it
2395,Margaret  Sweet,the class is easy you just have to show up i was very dissappointed because i love psyc classes and she was an aweful teacher buy the book a waste of money the only thing she will teach you all semester is attachment theory overall a bad teacher
2396,Margaret  Sweet,easy just go to class
2397,Margaret  Sweet,this class was ridiculous i usually enjoy my psyc classes and teachers but i cannot say the same for peg she is odd repititive hard headed and very dull just avoid this teacher and you have a problem spending on a book was because we never used it and the semester project was annoying because she is so damn picky
2398,Greta  Vollmer,english with greta is very laid back a good teacher and likes to engage the class a lot i say a hard grader but you get what you put in she really likes participation and gives reading assignments for homework the reading can be boring but too long very possible to receive an a in her class
2399,Greta  Vollmer,greta was a really nice laidback accessible funny english teacher i never felt like i was necessarily her student or that i was in an english class because she cares about engaging all of her students in their education treating us as adults she will be more than help you on essays or whatever so go to her office hours an easy a
2400,Greta  Vollmer,i had to write a review after all the notsoflattering ones that we posted about greta an amazing teacher who is nice accessible wants to help and is easy to talk to go to her office hours and tell you what to write for your essays no homework to tests or quizzes no midterm just essays take greta
2401,Greta  Vollmer,no comment
2402,Greta  Vollmer,greta was very helpful she can come on intimidating but has sincere care and concern for her students she is tough for our own good i came away from the class wtih an a and am positive that taking the course will be my reason for many to come let the other comments scare you
2403,Greta  Vollmer,you have to play up to greta if you want to get to teach then you have to take this course which the course was a waste of time
2404,Greta  Vollmer,she is really helpful if you ask for it very interested in what you write about and is great when it comes to editing a rough draft so you can improve she has helped me to improve my writing skills so much she expects a lot out of her student so dont slack off but she doesnt expect something of you unless she believes it can be done
2405,Greta  Vollmer,greta can been intimidating from the start but she is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor who really does want her students to engage and interact with the material if you get past the intimidation you can learn a lot from her
2406,Greta  Vollmer,horrible english is my favorite subject and i hated this class with a passion she will tell you not to do something in your paper then take points off becuase of it a lot of the class failed try not to take her if you can help it
2407,Greta  Vollmer,just a poor teacher no social etiquette and made me dislike my favorite subject
2408,Greta  Vollmer,i love english i spend my free time writing and have always prided myself on my writing skills she made me hate this class her attitude towards her students is similar to graders her class is pathetic and she only helps students that are basically failing instead of those that put fourth effort i recommend this to anyone
2409,Greta  Vollmer,one of my favorites i had her for two different classes a great teacher and if you have any issues with her just talk to her outside of class she may not seem approachable but actually easy to talk with once you make the first move
2410,Greta  Vollmer,greta is extremely concerned with her futures my writing improved dramatically in her classes highly recommended for upper division english
2411,Greta  Vollmer,fantastic teacher who is very interested in her futures
2412,Greta  Vollmer,no comments
2413,Greta  Vollmer,i think she was nice not as clear as desired but she keeps up student relations
2414,Greta  Vollmer,no comments
2415,Mark  Liff,worst teacher i ever had has no clue what he is talking about he teaches a concept decides it is wrong and reteaches it again but tests you on the wrong one i took advanced honors physics in high school and got an a but struggled to get a c in this class i basically selftaught in this class
2416,Mark  Liff,he is so confused the guy just has no idea how to teach there were many times when he would write a problem on the board realize he did it incorrectly and ended up erasing the whole thing and taking another minutes to reteach it and that was just one of the many problems in that class if you value you what learning do not take him
2417,Mark  Liff,his class is easy in the sense that it is easy to pass it is very very hard to get a good grade but if you just want to pass this is your guy
2418,Mark  Liff,dr liff is awesome really helpful i had him for a summer course and it was really easy able to be exempt from every test including the final if you took physics in high school be fine one of the funniest teachers ever had definitely need to take him as a teacher
2419,Mark  Liff,hes real funny in class but the workload is intense if you apply yourself you can get a good grade but the tests are hard and the final is even harder
2420,Mark  Liff,physics is hard you must do all homewrk to understand highly recommended get a tutor to help you do all the homework the final exam is very very hard
2421,Mark  Liff,this guy sucks he seems nice but then doesnt help u at all he leaves u to get a bad grade dont take
2422,Mark  Liff,he makes the difficult parts easier u just have to pay attention on him
2423,Mark  Liff,he teaches pretty well he really silly
2424,Mark  Liff,this class is hard but liff is a good teacher just go to class and do the homework and be fine for the tests pretty funny and goes over the material multiple times pretty fair grader too just miss any labs cause kill your grade
2425,Mark  Liff,no comments
2426,Mark  Liff,he is a very encouraging professor he is both serious and humorous about the course he explained things clearly to make sure all understood
2427,Mark  Liff,had physics in hs it made the class super easy liff is a good guy hard to understand at first but def the one id recommend to take for this class i have a problem at all got an a he likes to crack really lame jokes so get ready for some laughs
2428,Mark  Liff,not native english speaking very easy tests are simple goes over every problem not a lot of work or require must from you hard if come to class
2429,Mark  Liff,always pronounced my name wrong oh well if i taken phsyics in hs the class would be super confusing he needs a new teaching method if you already had physics take this class and be easy if you take someone native to the us
2430,Mark  Liff,if you were good in physics in high school good for you this is so much harder had in h.s now barely passing does not give partial credit grr not very helpful thinks easy but he isnt takes attendance everyday
2431,Mark  Liff,he is not easy and never trust you.do not take this class with him
2432,Mark  Liff,liff is the man def take him if you can sure the tests are hard but he does try to give you partial credit and he gives out lots of extra credit stay with it he is always tyring to help out if you are behind
2433,Mark  Liff,i had him for a summer course at penn and i thought he was pretty awful he thinks a really good teacher and he really he also really care much about helping us but he was easy so i did get a good grade and i did learn the basics
2434,Mark  Liff,awesome and funny teacher repeats himself so that everyone understands which helps tremendously gives out lotsa extra credit the tests were a little hard tho tests are not hard but difficult skip this class miss a lot
2435,Lynn  Curtright,very great teach sad that he his leaving one of my favorite professors he is truly hilarious
2436,Lynn  Curtright,mr curtright is a very good professor i have taken both world history classes and i loved them both he means business when it comes to studying and paying attention in class but he is funny and down to earth when you get to know him sadly the fall semester was his last one teaching at tcc going to miss his class
2437,Lynn  Curtright,not the nicest guy but he is good at lecturing if you can make yourself pay attention during lecture and study you should be able to pass he gives outlines for lecture and the majority of his tests are the study questions on the lecture outlines not the best but certainly not the worst
2438,Lynn  Curtright,this professor use the book yet he expects you to read every page he assigns the only grades he gives are for the four tests that hardly have anything to do with history or his lectures his lectures are dull and i have fallen asleep on many occasions in his class unless you want to be bored to death do not take him
2439,Lynn  Curtright,unless you are a total history buff this class is miserable ive never made anything lower than a b and i failed and had to withdraw he drones is a jerk when you ask questions and the only grades come from tests which include written portion use board at all attendance is mandatory book and outline connect
2440,Lynn  Curtright,history just not my area of expertise for some he drones i found his sidebar commentary to be comical however tests yielded questions to see how engaged you were during lecture and your ability to take quality notes went to office still improve grade all that i ask is that an instructor is fair and he is
2441,Lynn  Curtright,curtright has got a great sense of humour but this class is lecturebased and unless you have prior knowledge on each topic you are pretty much going to sleep through them it is nearly impossible to link the outlines to the text he use the textbook for assignments but without supplement to his lectures you will do poorly in this course
2442,Lynn  Curtright,teacher thinks he is hilarious and tries to get everyone to give him a courtesy laugh almost every minute of the class his test grading is ridiculous if you have his exact same opinion on the writing portion you will fail
2443,Lynn  Curtright,if you find history boring do not take this instructor he lectures the extensive material tells you to read the book no study guide no test review nothing to help out the students he seem to care if you pass or fail he just likes to talk about history very dry and boring lecture style
2444,Lynn  Curtright,an old fashioned lecturesonly teacher stands up there with an old projecter that uses transparencies and just drones on the whole time nice guy though knows his stuff and teaches it well no homework either if you are good with just an occasional test and can show up every day and pay attention pretty great
2445,Lynn  Curtright,first and foremost the stereotypical professor that stands in front of class and just talks at you until time is up even though i like history it was pretty boring you never have homework though just lectures and tests i mind him but i certainly want to take his class again
2446,Lynn  Curtright,i took him for woh and euh for history want any other professor than him i like his lecturing but i wish he puts a mini quiz towards every class so we could get more pts i never bought the book and passed both of his class with a c exams no finals points maximum attendance is mandatory so miss out
2447,Lynn  Curtright,not doubt passionate about his subject and his multiple choice portions are fairly easy however memorizing the entire history the roman empire will get you no more than a c on his exams so strict i once told him perhaps i was studying incorrectly and if something i should focus on he said just study o.o
2448,Lynn  Curtright,not interesting very rude at times will not take again
2449,Lynn  Curtright,take his class if only because super easy all you really have to do is show up and remember enough to pass three very simple exams i notice most of the negative reviews here have to do more with him as a person than his teaching yes he is a snarky elitist old conservative papist but he adds some fascinating commentary
2450,Lynn  Curtright,i passed his class with a b he was unpleasant at times and his teaching style was very oldworld he did have a unique take on history antiamerican antiatheist antilutheran etc compared early christians to hippie welfare bums he is very full of himself but his class too hard to pass if you take decent notes easy tests
2451,Lynn  Curtright,he is a wonderful teacher and very enthusiastic about history i took his express woh2012 this past fall and passed with a b he is lecture based so interrupt the class wait until after the class you really need the textbook but i would advise to attend class and be a good note taker i will definitely be taking him in the hist
2452,Lynn  Curtright,he wont answer questions during lecture wait until after class to ask any read the book as he does refer to it but the book lacks certain detail great guy if you attend class and pay attention his class is easy and he is willing to help anyone if they ask for it
2453,Lynn  Curtright,very enthusiastic about the class gets into detail with major places or characters in history
2454,Lynn  Curtright,i would recommend this class his test is super easy because he gives you most of the questions in the study guide but the essay part is really hard its pretty easy to get a b he takes attendance but is pretty lenient i would recommend going to every class however i liked him
2455,Rex  Abert,he is probably one of the worst professors had horrible at explaining what will be on the test spends the entire class period just doing examples but never fully explains the subject this class should have been easy and all of my friends who have a different professor are doing good but because a bad teacher not doing well
2456,Rex  Abert,prof abert is definitely a prof i will never take again nor will i recommend him to anyone i ended up catching the flu and missed the first test and he never responded to any of my emails and when i returned and asked to make up the test he said no and walked away the test i did take had questions also be prepared for nonstop homework
2457,Rex  Abert,incredibly helpful if you have questions
2458,Rex  Abert,this is by far one of my worst math teachers in my entire life does not explain many things on the tests loncapa is much more difficult than it should be since it does not give you the right answer when trying to teach the math to yourself i highly recommend not taking this class with him any other teacher is probably a better option
2459,Rex  Abert,hes a thorough instructor if your a math or engineering major hes your guy if not like i am not then he is not your guy got an a but he defiantly makes you work for it will ensure you are prepared for future math classes
2460,Rex  Abert,entire class consists of him doing examples he might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it homework is on loncapa which is the worst if you bring him the question do it for you though tests are alright if you review a good person but not the best teacher trig is hard and he really make it easier no book needed
2461,Rex  Abert,abert is a genuinely nice person and shows enthusiasm he will only invest in you if he sees that you invest yourself in learning the material this is math people you are inevitably going to practice constantly in order to fully grasp what you are learning the hw problems ever too challenging if you do the hw the tests should be eazy
2462,Rex  Abert,i love math easily my favorite subject this professor is very passionate and does an excellent job of explaining things not a fan of liberal arts math because i hate word problems he does an amazing job teaching and it was np for me attendance mandatory but i took it as express and if you skip you will easily fall behind
2463,Rex  Abert,professor abert was an all around decent professor for calc he struggles in teaching you new material right off the bat and typically expects that you will have read the section being covered in class before hand he curve or drop lowest test grade but he is a very easy grader on tests and gives a lot of partial credit on problems
2464,Rex  Abert,no comment he is awesome if not you are not doing what you have to do for a math class do not complain you teacher
2465,Rex  Abert,he is very knowledgeable and explains the material well but his lecture can seem neverending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class they are also very long some with questions but he gives you normally over a week to complete i would suggest taking mwf to have shorter lectures or else zone out
2466,Rex  Abert,get ready to take notes he writes them all on the black boards and post anything online if you miss class you wont have any idea going on unless you go to his office hours
2467,Rex  Abert,professor abert was a good professor he teaches a little fast in my opinion but he is very knowledgeable he takes attendance but does not give any in class quizzes of your grade is online loncapa and this alone will teach you everything you need to pass the class he does not give study guides for the tests but you can just review loncapa
2468,Rex  Abert,good at explaining new material moves at the perfect pace will answer any of your questions perfectly tests are a lot easier than the home works gives partial credit on tests tests are only of the grade so if you fail one dont worry
2469,Rex  Abert,great teacher going to his office hours is very helpful because he is willing to go over and workout any problem you ask him too lots of homework but it prepares you for the test pretty funny tests are based on the homework very fair grader skip class this class will not be an easy a study and do your work and you will get an a
2470,Rex  Abert,he is a great teacher do not get me wrong but he is teaching format is for students who clearly grasp the concept of math i am terrible at math and i did terrible in this class do all homeworks attend all classes if you are good at math i advise you take this class because it may be easier for you
2471,Rex  Abert,awful professor this was his first time teaching an mgf class and it clearly showed
2472,Rex  Abert,he is a mathematics man awesome i had him for precal and will take him all of myh maths if i can
2473,Rex  Abert,do it unless you are familiar with mac a straight a student had a difficult time test seem to have nothing to do with what studied normally rate professors unless necessary nice person but has a cocky show off style of teaching if not somewhat familiar with mac do it regret it
2474,Rex  Abert,mr abert was not my favorite professor there were times that he would preform examples in lecture wrong and he could not correct them the lectures were unclear and hard to follow also the tests were very hard compared to examples we had done in class and after talking to classmates it was a communal feeling that we were not prepared for them
2475,Liz  Dameron,make copies of the practice exam and continue doing it until your successful make copies of the lessons and do along with her videos in lab do all homework first then your quizzes your quizzes are on the test so practice the unit exam too
2476,Liz  Dameron,ms dameron is very clear with what is expected and how she grades she emails howto videos regularly provides good notes and worksheets and offers online students to come to campus to study with that class for tests she wants you to learn and pass the best teacher had at tcc
2477,Liz  Dameron,mrs dameron is a wonderful teacher she makes it easy and fun to pass her class anyone who need to take math class should take it with her
2478,Liz  Dameron,she is nice and wants you to pass but none of her lectures match up to the work that you have to do for mymathlab i am taking an online only class and it is probably the hardest thing i have ever taken since start college two years ago her lectures do not help and you will have to spend most of your time looking for other lessons online
2479,Liz  Dameron,professor dameron is an excellent professor if you do the work you will succeed professor dameron wants you to succeed she is very fair i took her online class and was quite please recommend her highly
2480,Liz  Dameron,i sutdy online make sure your keep with your online work the test are a reflection of your homework there were no surprises its def possible to get an easy a in the class just do your work
2481,Liz  Dameron,professor dameron wants you to succeed you must do the work and put forth the effort if you do what she asks you will succeed great class and great professor
2482,Liz  Dameron,she is awesome lets you retake your lowest grade for the final if you want to she gives great videos im not good at math at all and i understood it with her
2483,Liz  Dameron,taken multiple math classes at tcc over and over again because they are so difficult for me to pass i should have just taken mgf1106 and with dameron from the beginning she got me to pass math and actually enjoy it too she is an amazing professor take her if math is a struggle for you
2484,Liz  Dameron,outstanding teacher one of the best math teachers i have ever had tests and online if you attend class you will easily pass
2485,Liz  Dameron,very thorough sleep on the index cards she gives out they really work she allows a retake if needed very fair and wants everyone to succeed one of the best instructors at tcc a gem
2486,Liz  Dameron,ms.dameron is one of the best teachers that ive had tcc she is very patient and will work with you i absoultely hate math but ms dameron made the class tolerable my suggestion would be to take her
2487,Liz  Dameron,time taking this others i made if you understand she takes time patiently walks you through it can be retaken until you get a grade happy with at the end of the semester if you happy with one of your test grades retake it if you are happy with all grades you have to go to class the last few days
2488,Liz  Dameron,i took the main summer online class it was great for a mathwhich i really do not like you use course compass she uses scanned powerpoints to teach the sections but i really just looked over them and focused on the textbooks chapter videos they help because it shows step by step great class but online is a lot of work but very doable
2489,Liz  Dameron,wonderful teacher i have disliked math for many years but mrs dameron helped tremendously i would take her class again
2490,Liz  Dameron,she is a wonderful teacher she makes everything crystal clear and always returns email i am taking her online.i see her once a week with any questions i have a she has helped me all you have to do is cc and tests at the end of the semester you can retake the lowest test so you make a better grade and do the extra credit that she gives
2491,Liz  Dameron,she is the sweetest teacher ever she will help you out any chance she gets but u will earn ever single grade u get n her u want to earn extra credit u better do all the extra credit assignments she give u if not she will not be giving u no extra points to move a letter grade.but overall she is the best teacher ever
2492,Liz  Dameron,extremely helpful and will go out of her way to help you understand the concepts offered extra credit opportunities with the first tests and replaced lowest test grade with the final if final is higher as long as you put forth effort you should do great in her class
2493,Liz  Dameron,she is the sweetest professor and most helpful math teacher i have ever had trust me take her ive always been horrible at math intill this will work any problem you need anytime gives easy ec and test are just like study guide easy and nice
2494,Liz  Dameron,love this teacher great she explains everything clearly and works with you if you have any questions she gives out extra credit for all the tests and the tests themselves are exactly what she goes over there are no surprises taken her twice now and been amazing both times definitely take her you be disappointed
2495,Matthew  Unger,defiantly recommend took him for my western humanities and signing up with him again for humanities explains everything very clearly and sets a good pace very nice teacher
2496,Matthew  Unger,just plain out take him u wont regret it
2497,Matthew  Unger,mr unger is a great teacher i took his online class for hum he states everything clearly as far as deadlines and objectives he is understanding and helpful i would do a few quizzes a week and reviewed those for the final and passed turn the journals in on time they are a great portion of your points very self paced relaxed class
2498,Matthew  Unger,excellent teaher highly reccomended i took his online class you can work ahead and you do not have to go to the testing center essays and a final you will need the text books so get them
2499,Matthew  Unger,took web class great teacher and awesome class hws super easy straight from book and a few journals and dbs no deadlines for hws very selfpaced very responsive if you need help only test is final multiple choice at home can tell he really enjoys what he teaches take this class
2500,Matthew  Unger,took web class great teacher and awesome class hws super easy straight from book and a few journals and dbs no deadlines for hws very selfpaced very responsive if you need help only test is final multiple choice at home can tell he really enjoys what he teaches take this class
2501,Matthew  Unger,mr.unger is a really good teacher and his online class was great i would recommend him to anyone his online rel2300 class was very easy and self paced journals kind of difficult but not really other than that great teacher and he also explains to you why he gave the grade he did really good take his class
2502,Matthew  Unger,i took his hum and his class is hard to fail all you have to do is complete the assignments which for the most part are open book quiezzes and they are not timed so take him
2503,Matthew  Unger,professor unger was very clear about his expectations and good about communication the material was laid out in a manner that you could work at your own pace for the most part the journal was tough but that is because it required a lot of introspection study guide for final was awesome i enjoyed the class a great deal
2504,Matthew  Unger,taking the online class it is really well structured the first quiz to take is a quiz on the syllabus so he assures the student has a clear understanding of the expectations for the class repeatable quiz an a is quite attainable so long as you let yourself fall behind follow the suggested timeline great course
2505,Matthew  Unger,marc is a great instructor with a true passion for philosophy they class i took with him but marc commas are your friends and your too
2506,Matthew  Unger,web class hardly used the sucky book just lookedup the answers online really do much but post a discussion which he loves as little as possible and guessed my way through the tests he answers all your questions promptly
2507,Matthew  Unger,took the web course it was a challenge since there is a lot of to remember otherwise interesting enough that learning it too bad all were online and open book writing project was timeconsuming and tedious best part was not stepping foot on campus to complete this course.self motivated students onl
2508,Matthew  Unger,webbased i wish most teachers designed their webbased classes like mr unger he was thorough clear and creative in how he got us participating as a group i learned morea about my classmates in this class than in a traditional class read study interract and take the openbook quizzes and tests you will pass a with a little effort
2509,Matthew  Unger,well this guy is as dry as a piece of sandpaper if you have ever seen the guy from the clear eyes commericials he reminds me of him but having said all that his class is not difficult i made a b and do to much he lectures off powerpoint and the test comes direcetly off that he also gives min breaks for the hour class
2510,Matthew  Unger,mr unger is a thorough professor his method of teaching requires detailed well developed answers his final exam was difficult specifically the exam questions but he offers them prior to he does not offer extra credit but is helpful when a question arises an a is attainable but the student must work for it
2511,Matthew  Unger,interesting class lots of notes but you can print powerpoint off blackboard and take it to class tests and paper were easy but final was difficult if you miss one class you miss a lot i would definatley reccomend this class
2512,Matthew  Unger,i took the web class the class itself was very easy with online exams you can take as many times as you need the only thing i hated was the final four essay questions at words each and about multiple choice all based on previous test paper way too much to remember for a final
2513,Matthew  Unger,very interesting class super fair tests very pleasant professor not an easy a but attainable go to class and start your journals early and you have any trouble passing unger seems like a genuinly nice guy
2514,Matthew  Unger,all in all a very good professor the lecture can get pretty boring at times but all very clear and structured and there are never any surprises if you go to class and pay attention you will do well also his sense of humor rules
2515,Andrea  Neves,i have never met a professor who is so rude and condescending to students she would humiliate students in my class on a regular basis obviously thinks the world of herself talks about herself constantly very harsh grading and gives tons of very dry reading i would never recommend a class with her
2516,Andrea  Neves,prof neves taught this class in the summer the daily format led to a challenging class with a huge amount of reading but the class was wonderfully stimulating prof inclass discussion format causes students to think take her class if you can you will learn a lot if you do the work needed to learn
2517,Andrea  Neves,she is completely rude and difficult to understand she is not helpful nor gracious
2518,Andrea  Neves,andrea neves was one of the best professors i ever had she taught me that if you have high expectations get high performance she is a fighter for students who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic backgrounds she is simply an amazing woman
2519,Andrea  Neves,surprised she is still teaching evidently she improved in the last years i took a mexicanamerican studies class from her in the i was very interested in the subject but i have to say she was the worst professor i have ever had in my entire academic career what a miserable arrogant condescending person
2520,Andrea  Neves,if you want to hate yourself for an entire semester then i highly recommend her class
2521,Andrea  Neves,b this lady has a stick up her stanford behind unless you are previously from stanford or really care about stanford do not take her class if you have to write any essays about stanford graduates and repeat exactly what she has said in class
2522,Andrea  Neves,she is used to teaching stanford students and she is hard but if you do the reading and participate in class she is not that bad i was not a great student and i walked away with an a in the class do the hw and let her intimidate you
2523,Andrea  Neves,no comments
2524,Andrea  Neves,she is hostile defensive patronizing inflexible unsympathetic and mean she seems to actively dislike students if she know the answer ignore your question or pretend that she does
2525,Andrea  Neves,she was the worst professor i have ever had in my four years in college
2526,Andrea  Neves,she is the devil if you agree with her you are wrong and will suffer the consequences
2527,Andrea  Neves,terrible boring class sort of pissy and not cool
2528,Andrea  Neves,no comments
2529,Andrea  Neves,no comments
2530,Manuel  Daniels,this class is no joke he give tests the whole semester and drops the lowest test score if u do the extra credit points so if u have and did all the extra credit have a b in the class he is pretty helpful if you go to his office the class is hard as hell i wouldnt take the class again.if u like science this will be ya boy
2531,Manuel  Daniels,i like him jolly fellow but he does run through things a tad quickly the class itself is hard you cannot half ass this course study
2532,Manuel  Daniels,mr daniels is a very nice man he uses all of his time wisely and if you attend class regularly you be surprised by the different quizzes he assigns he has an outline for every unit test one thing to know is that there are things on the test that are not on the outline you nerd the book to do really well on the tests
2533,Manuel  Daniels,he is a very nice teacher he knows his material and he teaches well i would recommend him to anyone he makes jokes but they always funny he gives outlines for every unit tests are kind of tough be prepared to study
2534,Manuel  Daniels,he is a very nice teacher and willing to work with every student he gives alot of extra credit go to class every day and take good notes use the outline make sure to study very hard for the tests though he is funny and classes are interesting
2535,Manuel  Daniels,he is all over the place and it is very difficult to tell where he is at in the lecture so you really keep up would not recommend to anyone the only good thing about him is that he gives a little extra credit
2536,Manuel  Daniels,i am surprised at the low ratings for this prof he is really a good teacher if you pay attention take good notes just study for the exams it is an easy class he is very helpful offers extra credit his lectures are interesting he is clear in his speech is the content is very understandable it is an easy a if you prepare for exams
2537,Manuel  Daniels,decent class make sure you print out all the notes and write in the margins to study there are tests and he drops the lowest grade if you take all kinda funny sometimes gives some extra credit
2538,Manuel  Daniels,pure hot garbage
2539,Manuel  Daniels,he is a nice guy offers extra credit and is willing to help however he that clear when he speaks because he talks fast and confuses himself at times for the tests he simply says read the chapters look at the outline look at the tables do the learning outcomes and the chapter quizzes not very helpful and its a lot to study
2540,Manuel  Daniels,like this class at all
2541,Manuel  Daniels,he is such a great teacher and loves what he does simply print out the guidelines and write simple notes in the margin and study it you have at least a b in the class he is such a nice guy and makes a lot of jokes i would recommend him to anyone oh and he drops one test grade if you take all
2542,Manuel  Daniels,you really need to go to class everyday whoever says that he is a bad teacher is probably one of those slackers that never come to class if you come to class take notes and ask questions when you have them do fine i hate biology and i got a b seriously i would definitely recommend taking him if your a hard worker
2543,Manuel  Daniels,whoever is saying he doesnt offer extra credit is a bold faced lie its even on the syllabus you prbly never showed up to earn any ec or even read it ill admit i struggled but he always said come to office and he showed exactly where the answer was on our outlines he printed out ive been outta high school and got a b
2544,Manuel  Daniels,mr daniels seems hard at first but contrary to what you read you can easily get a b or an a he has no homework only tests final that is the same weight of the tests drops the lowest test score offers points extra credit that he adds to your grade so if you have a add those points u get a b.the extra credit is simple he is corny
2545,Manuel  Daniels,really good teacher plenty of extra credit.i enjoyed going to class and that rare so far is one of the best teachers ive had at tcc
2546,Manuel  Daniels,wow ok of all the people that say a bad teacher are just dumb people plain and simple you probably could just read and look at the outline and still get an a in the class he is always willing to help you breaks the material down so a grader could understand and above all an awesome guy my favorite teacher at tcc byfar
2547,Manuel  Daniels,he anything special that for sure sits there and reads everything from a powerpoint i showed up on the test days and thats it studied from the book the grading is pretty easy there are five tests and a final all worth points and you get to drop the lowest test grade for a total of points so you can bomb one test and be fine
2548,Manuel  Daniels,bottom line dont take him an idiot and you will know less walking out than you did walking in grade is all test no ec or hw give a crap about his students you will be teaching yourself
2549,Manuel  Daniels,every test we have taken i went to his office and he was able to show me on the outline where the answer was true there are no assignments but there is optional extra credit if u do all of them it will raise your final grade a whole letter grade u have to study that why in school it is not an easy a but he is more than fair
2550,Jennifer  Jossendal,very real professor who gives no bs she tells you the way it is and what the history really was like she gives her opinion which tend to be very strong but hears other peoples opinions and respects them learned so many great things from this class and professor highly recommend
2551,Jennifer  Jossendal,previously taken the online course to avoid the in class nonsense make a difference with her grading and lack of communication emails never the less jenni expects the most out of her students no excuses are tolerated read books in semester if you complete the book reviews you will fail honesty matter
2552,Jennifer  Jossendal,expect to read novels during this course no textbook but she puts all relevant readings online for students expect to have to read an article and answer questions as homework for every class most of your grade comes from the extremely important book reports most class periods are spent gathering in a large circle and discussing as a class
2553,Jennifer  Jossendal,im not sure if she knows this but not everyone who takes their class is majoring in history she requires a ridiculous amount of work for an introductory class i dropped her class within a week after i realized her attitude and extensive reading and other assignments and a school counselor advised me not to take her so dont even
2554,Jennifer  Jossendal,just the worst
2555,Jennifer  Jossendal,do not take her i hated her class and dreaded going not only was it a waste of time but also a waste of money i learned nothing she never went over the class material she talked basically current events the whole time when this was a class about the expected to read chapter books on top of all the other articles she assigned
2556,Jennifer  Jossendal,lots of book reading but not much else
2557,Jennifer  Jossendal,she is super strict if you do not complete something be ready to be kicked out of class she thinks her class is the only thing going on in our she assigns mass amounts of homework to be due immediately random pop quizzes are huge if you think you can come to class and review what you just read forget it you should know everything
2558,Jennifer  Jossendal,will never take this class again if not a die hard history lover trust me take the class regret it real quick
2559,Jennifer  Jossendal,she care about any excuses if you miss a book review or a test expect a she makes you read books in one semester
2560,Jennifer  Jossendal,i got an a in the class but i hated going to class i dreaded it when we were in class we even talk about history majority of the time you have to read four chapter books and do a book review those are your tests if you read you pass the were a pain she gives so much info that it is hard to get ready for a quiz
2561,Jennifer  Jossendal,lots of homework but the homework is really easy tests were rare and not very hard
2562,Jennifer  Jossendal,great teacher do the work and you will get an a slack off and you will fail just like any other class
2563,Jennifer  Jossendal,she is an awesome teacher when asked for help she will give it her classes are always interesting and though she strays sometimes she always incorporates the topic of the day
2564,Jennifer  Jossendal,terrible teacher we spent all class discussing current events instead of the history suppose to be studying you basically have to teach yourself the material the only time she goes over it is after you take the exam on it at that time the point anymore also she gives tons of homework i love history but this was a bad experience
2565,Jennifer  Jossendal,take this class she gives you all the homework and tests in advance you do need to use the book but only because the answers are right there you need to read it she gives you the page numbers the tests hard open there is something due every week but not a lot and you can work ahead recommend this class
2566,Jennifer  Jossendal,for a summer online class this was easy she lets you work ahead you only have and she gives you optional due dates i think pretty easy but like all online classes you have to do a bit of work quiz a week discussion and one exam but most of them are easy and at your own pace not timed nice summer class
2567,Jennifer  Jossendal,i would not recommend her at least not for an online class she respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time and she is not very helpful she also makes turning assignments in much more difficult than it needs to be this is the worst online class ever taken
2568,Jennifer  Jossendal,i will never take another online class again because of her
2569,Jennifer  Jossendal,took a while to email back but overall loved it
2570,Griswold,tedious
2571,Griswold,it was a lot of work especially the outlining and her tests and quizzes were pretty hard but she was super helpful and very nice though it was hard i loved her as a teacher i am horrible at history but i actually got an a in this class you just have to be willing to put in the effort and you can get an a most in my class also got an a
2572,Griswold,i know why everyone seems to hate her i liked her yes she is a hard teacher and yes she requires quite a bit of writing but this is college not primary school and as far as an a being impossible that is so wrong i got an a maybe honor students are held to higher standards or maybe you were just too lazy to do all of the work
2573,Griswold,you mean still there i had her back in late and was a nightmare then i dropped the class and took a different section later on
2574,Griswold,i called this my assumed history class because of the number of times she said i think this is what probably happened even though not what the book says also she had us outlining the chapters and then lecturing on the same material it really was overkill for a topic as basic as us history
2575,Griswold,go find another class if there is a warning bell in your head let it sound out now any student would be better off buying the book and reading it at home
2576,Griswold,i had this woman as a substitute teacher in jr high and high school and she was even worse when given her own class she gave me a c on what was a b level paper simply due to the fact that she agree my opinions or those of my sources she feels that any opinion she share is wrong and possible in the realm of real world
2577,Griswold,will never take another class from her thinks the whole world ishes and evrone should kiss up to her she needs to get with it
2578,Griswold,there is no possible way to get an a in her class and im an honors student
2579,Griswold,oh my god this class was an absolute disaster for me to go to note taking is not an easy task in her class since she goes off topic so much also when you are taking her tests be prepared to do more writing than you would in a creative writing class i do not suggest this class for anyone
2580,Griswold,lectures straight from the text boring unclear on directions likes to keep the class confused a jr college sistructor who wishes she was at the university made the class hand in multiple works cited pages with guidelines more stringent than advanced english classes she needs a life
2581,Griswold,no comments
2582,Laurie  Folgate,explain things well
2583,Laurie  Folgate,no comments
2584,John  Bland,very kind
2585,John  Bland,john made class fun interesting.he was an awesome teacher that will be missed by many he touched the lives of all his students and had a big impact on all of us kish lost an icredible teacher this month
2586,Morna  Livingston,worst teacher
2587,Morna  Livingston,i went into this class excited because one of those losers that actually likes architectural history mourna is the worst professor if you think you study hard wrong never had a class that was as awful as this one and i cried a lot if you want to talk to the professor she has a pretty interesting life but take the class
2588,Morna  Livingston,morna is so very sweet i would love to talk to her about other matters than that of design or drawing a great person with a lovely smile but not exactly the best professor her directions for assignments are always different for each class it seems helpful but i think she always knows how to say what the best way to do something is
2589,Morna  Livingston,an extremely sweet women but does not know how to direct students on learning to draw better without confusing them several times when an assignment was given people would do it wrong and have to redo it for the next class
2590,Morna  Livingston,if you find out that you have her as a professor for either design or drawing you need to immediately request changing classes she should have retired years ago
2591,Morna  Livingston,very hard to follow slide presentations are unlabeled making images difficult to identify crucial for exams tough grader but the tests are doable the case study was a nightmare while morna was willing to help through email and meeings her criticism was never constructive or helpful make sure you use the ta
2592,Morna  Livingston,a really sweet old lady but if you have a ta in the class then have no idea going on or what to expect out of projects our ta basically translated everything to us individually after she tried explaining it as a whole she really is pretty knowledgable about design but she realize that we know anything yet
2593,Morna  Livingston,livingston is probably one of the worst teachers at philau not only does she not teach she grades extremely hard on the test you have and fails the entire class she is not a historian or a architect teaching architecture history do not take her class if you want to pass this course highly unrecommend
2594,Morna  Livingston,a very nice person quite old but seems to have a good head on her shoulders teacher wise not very good she never explains thorougly and never answers questions she gets easily disappointed in your work because not what she wants highly unrecommended
2595,Morna  Livingston,she never gives constructive feedback only negative feedback i learn anything from her class so if you want to learn take her
2596,Morna  Livingston,the worst teacher ever had she even challenging just rude completely unfair not understanding and judgemental emphasis on mental i loved design and accelled in it but her class ruined my passion she needs to retire desperately take her class old and fake
2597,Morna  Livingston,morna is great she is extremely knowledgable and pleasant an excellent resource inside and outside the classroom
2598,Morna  Livingston,okay but she assumes that you already know what to do for stuff when you and acts disappointed when wrong really confusing but if you catch her on a good day nice pray to god that you have a t.a in her class or screwed though
2599,Morna  Livingston,morna is one of the nicest most interesting ppl in the world she has good stories but they dont always relate to what youre doing she doesnt always make it clear what she wants but if you dont give her what she wants she will tell you and help you make it better do your work and care about it and she will be nice during crits usually
2600,Morna  Livingston,morna is a great woman but as a professor i know if i would have gotten by without the ta there to clarify and helf with everything with a ta good without a ta not so much
2601,Morna  Livingston,she is the worst teacher ever shes old a senile and not very helpful shes a photographer of architecture not an architect therefore she doesnt know much about actual architecture
2602,Morna  Livingston,morna knows what she is talking about and has alot of knowledge in the design industry she may not be as forceful as other teachers but she still helps out if you ever need it and will work with you outside of class which alot of other teachers do i would recomend her for design
2603,Morna  Livingston,nice woman most of the time but sucks as a teacher do not take she is very feminist too
2604,Morna  Livingston,good teacher werk hard and smile during ur crit listen then let u sit bring in a piece of shyt model expect her to get out of her seat pick up ur piece of shyt n destroy it do ur werk n like her if she asks for analysis drawings do and jus ask her help u never need to do as much werk that she originally asks
2605,Morna  Livingston,morna is a very nice woman but she doesnt like your first design for pretty much all projects even when you do exactly what the handout says also she doesnt give much feedback during the process but when it come to the crit she is full of negative things to say about your work
2606,Steve  Grout,great history professor and always prepared for class easy to talk to and is willing to help if you need it take grout hes one of the best history profs
2607,Steve  Grout,traveled all over so classes are cool because actually been where talking about passionate about what he does and ramble fair and friendly as far as his tests you have to know your stuff so study and do fine def the model professor
2608,Steve  Grout,there is a reason grout is so loved on campus he is a kind man with immense knowledge and passion for architecture and teaching while he is one of the easiest history of arch professors students are happier and generally more interested in learning with him than in other classes a wonderful man who every teacher should aspire to emulate
2609,Steve  Grout,great teacher took him for design and wish i could have taken him for history of architecture he is so helpful put u down although he will tell you what ur doin could be better
2610,Steve  Grout,great teacher very easy and helpful makes stuff interesting great guy take him best decision ever
2611,Steve  Grout,he is the best design teacher ever he knows what talking about and makes you feel good about your work as long as you have it done he only teaches design i so take him while you can
2612,Steve  Grout,best design teacher ever take his class instead of criticizing he helps you grow as a designer and improve your ideas best ever
2613,Steve  Grout,grout is the greatest design teacher he makes u look at ur design then take it and will help u to see things that u missed to make it better if u have the oppertunity to take grout do it he will change the way u look at things
2614,Steve  Grout,def the best design teacher no lie
2615,Steve  Grout,hes the man
2616,Steve  Grout,if its not greek its not that important hey can you guys see this slide oh forget it it matter asian arch spends fixing lighting in order to show greek arch quote these people blah blah this is grotesque very closed minded inconsiderate.but he may be a good design professor
2617,Steve  Grout,great guy lectures are informative and interesting he know alot and throws in contextual trival for fun really nice and not too hard if you pay attention
2618,Steve  Grout,whoever gave grout a must be a terrible design grout is the greatest man on earth and a modle teacher
2619,Steve  Grout,excellent professor very helpful but very hard grader
2620,Steve  Grout,he claimed it was an easy course but ended grading very hard and ridiculously grading sytem was horrible also favored boys over girls i do not recommend him
2621,Steve  Grout,nice really helpful lots of fun
2622,Steve  Grout,he offered me absolutely no help in the class i learned less from him than from any teacher i have ever taken i do not recommend him
2623,Steve  Grout,grout has to have been the best professor i have had here i am in my year here and still touch base with him he was a great help my first year at college and as someone has stated is a very valuable asset to this college
2624,Steve  Grout,the most helpful considerate and informative professor here at philau i had him for years and wish i was still in his class learn more from grout and will enjoy his classes even the am class
2625,Steve  Grout,professor grout is a asset to this university there arent many people out there that are as good at what they do like he is take him the atmosphere of his class is awesome
2626,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,he changed my life for the better
2627,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,prof coleman was an amazing man a great professor indeed he had high expectations and kept students working hard for a good grade college isnt supposed to be easy thank you for the stories memories and belief in myself you were an amazing man that cared for his students and their future and may your legacy live on
2628,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,terrible loss for the english department at ssu my heart goes out to his
2629,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,a sad loss for sonoma state truly the best at the entire institution
2630,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,this guy not even sure where to start smart and sometimes funny but is unclear and gives difficult assignments clarify what he wants would rather you figure it out for yourself grills students i took him as a freshmen first semester and regret it unless you enjoy a challenge choose a different teacher
2631,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,favorite professor ever took his class for ge and it blew my mind those who do not like hard work should stay away there are plenty of classes you can take and sleep through if all my classes had been as challenging and thought provoking as the one class i took with coleman my college years would have been amazing bravo
2632,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,he is not clear at all he asks for your questions but does not respond well to them he goes off on tangents that do not seem to relate to the point and some how you are supposed to make a connection it is time for him to retire
2633,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,an amazing prof who has heard and seen it all and will let you have it if he suspects you of bsing or laziness those who accuse him of being mean missed his point completely his relentless prodding is the effort of a man who genuinely cares about his students listen to the bitter students who take the heat the best at ssu
2634,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,i had this teacher in and he was an awesome teacher scary but in the end he made me think about what reading like i never have before and that is what got me through college he is a real teacher that expects you to learn
2635,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,by far the best teacher i have ever had without a doubt he has taught me more in courses than the rest of my college experience combined the people who give him a bad rap never invested enough in their learning to understand him in the first place the only teacher who waste your time but he expects that you want to learn
2636,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,very difficult class robert coleman enjoys putting students on the spotlight and will keep pressuring you to speak even when you have no idea what to say try to speak as little as possible in the class do not raise your hand you have to read about pages of online or textbook material for each class or else he will put you on the spot
2637,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,coleman is fascinating to listen to but unfortunately he is extremely unclear about assignments he is not useful when you ask for clarification on assignments and just expects you to know what he means on his obtuse questions very intelligent man but needs to learn how to support students as much as he challenges them
2638,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,coleman is challenging students basically argue for a whole hours other will say that he is not worth putting up with he does come off as belittling so if you are up for a challenge take this class if not avoid it because you will be put on the spot other than that he has a lot to say and numerous interesting heart wrenching stories
2639,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,difficult but totally awesome worth the work
2640,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,bob coleman is not a teacher he gets off to embarrassing his students if you take this class raise your hand because if your wrong he will belittle you he will spew useless amounts of random knowledge to make you think he is a genius a teacher is meant to guide his students not destroy them
2641,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,coleman is a hugely influential teacher and is very knowledgeable but he is very unclear about his assignments his final for this class was horrible and he still given back one grade from the beginning of the semester he is intimidating and nothing you say is ever good enough
2642,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,there is no doubt in my mind that coleman was the most influential professor i ever had i was a student of his yrs ago still in awe of the learning experience i had in his courses anyone afraid of hard work thinking critically or extremely needy should probably forget about this dynamic prof
2643,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,look past his bully act and find someone remarkably intelligent and genuinely caring think rationally keep your emotions in check open your mind and put serious thought into the things that bob says and you will benefit tremendously from him only those who put true and honest effort into their studies succeed with bob
2644,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,coleman expects to much from his students.if you are a full time student i do not suggest taking any of his classes.i was not expecting an easy a from his class i do not expect any english class to be easy i spoke with him multiple times during his office hours instead of helping me he demeaned my intelligence
2645,Robert  Coleman-Senghor,while bob class was undoubtedly one of the most difficult i have taken with high expectations and a large workload i can honestly say it was one of the best classes taken at ssu i am more proud of the work i did in this class than in any other bob also puts an incredible amount of work and effort into his classes
2646,John  Burk,john burk is a great professor i failed business calc the first time but after taking him i actually started understanding he gives a good bit of homework but it all helps for the exams that he gives
2647,John  Burk,very comfortable pace for a calc class he goes over several examples for each topic and leaves time at the end of class for questions very easy to reach to meet during office hours if trying to get into the school of business but struggle with calc the perfect teacher
2648,John  Burk,best math teacher ever had had to drop calculus twice before taking his class but got a b with him
2649,John  Burk,best professor of all time
2650,John  Burk,hands down best math teacher ever had if you ever have any questions go to office hours i went almost every week with homework questions and he was so so so helpful his tests and homework are fair he drops your lowest quiz as well he is a very clear and organized lecturer and is extremely approachable and helpful sweet sweet guy
2651,John  Burk,professor burk is awesome best math teacher i have ever had he truly cares about his students and goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone understands the material
2652,John  Burk,seriously in love with this man he is so helpful and caring best professor ever had i highly recommend him
2653,John  Burk,great guy who cares about his students he will do anything to help you and is very approachable
2654,John  Burk,the best
2655,John  Burk,professor burk is the nicest guy ever he genuinely cares about how you are doing in his class and he will go out of his way to help you understand concepts if you need the extra help he also will even stop during class to check and see if anyone needs clarification take him if you get the chance
2656,John  Burk,professor burk is the best mathematics professor you will ever have extremely helpful and really cares about his students very fair quizzes and exams gives a lot of homework but it helps with factoring in your final grade
2657,John  Burk,everything said is true he is completely fantastic the best had he cares about his students and wants you to do well he is very straightforward and understandable but even if you struggle he will help its not a blowoff and he takes attendance but going to class and doing all the work helps alot most test questions from the
2658,John  Burk,prof burk is literally the best professor i hate math and he made the class bearable moreover he is always willing to help and always responds to email recommend him for business calc
2659,John  Burk,professor burk is the best math teacher ever had he loves what he does and makes sure everyone understands what he is teaching he is always willing to help and is truly such a nice guy.i would recommend taking his business calculus class i got an a if you do all the homework and study for quizzes and tests set for an a
2660,John  Burk,professor burk is really a great cheerful guy he wants all of his students to succeed and is willing to do whatever he can to help each and every student get a good grade he explains everything well and has very helpful office hours one of my favorite instructors at pitt
2661,John  Burk,best professor ever genuinely a nice guy who just wants everyone to do well tests are nearly identical to the review problems he assigns always willing to clarify concepts in lecture and holds plenty of office hours
2662,John  Burk,one of the best math professors someone could hope for i had him for bus calc and he was wonderful he was always available to help even outside of his official office hours he really appreciates if you show that trying some of his test questions straight from the review and homework so as long as you understand those be fine
2663,John  Burk,i had him for business calc and he made everything easy to understand if you go to class and pay attention there is no way you can fail he is very nice cares about his students and approachable
2664,John  Burk,do i really need to say anything just look at the other comments great guy
2665,John  Burk,such a nice guy i do anything in the class and ended up with a b not hard to do well and even if you screw up the tests if you study for the final and do well on it get a good grade much better than beverly mitchell from what i hear
2666,Norma  Thompson,professor thompson was a great section leader she was able to control the direction of the class with leaders dialogue when a guiding hand was needed it was offered but most of the time we were on our own discussionf the great works in the corriculum to be fair her thucydides lecture was not one of the best of the semester and some have peg
2667,Norma  Thompson,the reasding list was juicylooking but by the end it was apparent that the class lacked structure and rationale lectures were not always on the mark and it seemed like her tas who also gave lectures were more clued in
2668,Patrick  Hersey,he is a great person with so kind heart i am so thankful that i met a person like chef hersey and got a lot of things to learn
2669,Patrick  Hersey,great chef and great teacher loved my two years here at fanshawe
2670,Patrick  Hersey,great teacher alot of experience in the industry and it shows in his teaching methods anytime you need help he is willing to give you his time
2671,Patrick  Hersey,best teacher ever
2672,Patrick  Hersey,no comments
2673,Patrick  Hersey,dry no experience weak food
2674,Patrick  Hersey,the note nazi could we have a little more information presented in a dry and boring way
2675,Gabrielle  Michaelis,was the absolute greatest math teacher ive ever had she was a sexy woman and could make a math class very entertaining i am absolutely crushed she is retired
2676,Gabrielle  Michaelis,she is an incredible math teacher and an incredible person she cares about each and every one of her students and she will help you as much as you need it she is fast at responding to emails and she is funny too one of the most wonderful and the most memorable professors ive ever had
2677,Gabrielle  Michaelis,she is absolutely the best math teacher ever had i have always struggled with math and with her help i passed the class
2678,Gabrielle  Michaelis,not a fan of math myself but she explains things in a helpful way
2679,Gabrielle  Michaelis,totally out there shes funny she she will call you stinky and ramble in but shes great
2680,Gabrielle  Michaelis,she is the best math professor you need to take math take her and you would be fine
2681,Gabrielle  Michaelis,she was a very helpful teacher and anyone who wants to pass and graduate obviously has to do the work so why not take her and enjoy it give her a break a math teacher how easy is it to teach math and still maintain the attention not easy but she does it well
2682,Gabrielle  Michaelis,she makes math so fun and interesting she out of her way to make you understand she is a wonderful professor take her and you will be fine if you take her you will be a dum ass
2683,Gabrielle  Michaelis,sarcastic on the verge of being mean a little too cocky for my taste concentrate on the lesson without worrying what she was going to say next
2684,Gabrielle  Michaelis,overrated pretty full of herself
2685,Gabrielle  Michaelis,had to take college algebra havent had any algebra in years she makes it interesting and understandable she is very helpful takes time out in class to check your work overall a wonderful professor she even gives you partial credit on the tests for your work very fair with grading just dont miss class or you will get lost
2686,Gabrielle  Michaelis,made math very interesting.make sure you keep up with homework and ask questions if you understand.fun class.looked forward to this class.if you need a math class try to take her
2687,Gabrielle  Michaelis,the best damn teacher makes algebra so understandable
2688,Gabrielle  Michaelis,awesome teacher

2690,Gabrielle  Michaelis,no comments
2691,Gabrielle  Michaelis,amazing teacher makes you learn whether you realize it or not and very easy on the eyes take every and any math class you can with this woman
2692,Gabrielle  Michaelis,i had her for two semester she really takes the time out to help you with your work she is the best math teacher i ever had she is very funny and always talks about her kids a great professor
2693,Gabrielle  Michaelis,awesome teacher she made algebra bearable
2694,Gabrielle  Michaelis,she loves to teach.great teaching method and care about her students a lot she was born to be a great teacher and happy that taken her class once you regret it
2695,Carol  Solon,speech is a very scary course for many people i did very well in this class with her support she is witty and helpful i especially appreciated how she helped students with fear who were shy or english language learners build their confidence i wish she taught more classes
2696,Carol  Solon,one of the best teachers at ncc professor solon is one of those teachers who touches your life i learned so much in this class it also gave me the courage to take more art classes even though i am not an art student she difficult as long as you show your trying in the class she always offers help to her students
2697,Carol  Solon,best teacher ever you wanna a take her for anything
2698,Carol  Solon,i really liked her teaching style compared to the other speech teachers she is very good
2699,Carol  Solon,one of the most fake people i have ever known snotty and condescending in almost every comment she makes to students not in touch with people trying to teach at all not very understanding of even extenuating circumstances
2700,Pantaleon  Pangelinan Jr,he is definitely one of the best electronics instructors ever studied under very knowledgeable in the subject his explanations are clear as long as you do the homework and required labs you should get an a or a b the only bad thing about the class is the schedule to pm sometimes he lets us leave a little bit early
2701,Pantaleon  Pangelinan Jr,fun and knowledgable person taught the easiest ways to do binary numbers and made circuit schematics look like cake while others know squat the only downside is the time of the class and he makes you stay up til in the evening
2702,Pantaleon  Pangelinan Jr,he is very good this was my first electronics course and he made the material very clear and easy to understand and the material itself is not easy at all but he manage to make it understanable just wait until the end to do the hw or you are going to be sorry take very good notes and ask
2703,Pantaleon  Pangelinan Jr,no comments
2704,Tim  Wandling,a cool professor who cares about his students sometimes really hard to reach outside of class lectures felt very long sometimes because he tends to talk a lot sometimes but makes them more interesting with visual aids a lot of reading that we did but he breaks it up so if you keep up be fine looking forward to part
2705,Tim  Wandling,tim is a very hands on professor and loves it when you ask him questions on scientific ideas or topics in the world i had him for my flc and i would take any class as him as the professor the only thing is you have to read to books he assigns and watch the movies too
2706,Tim  Wandling,this sfi class was definitely my favorite course from my first year at ssu tim offers really interesting and inspiring points of view gives really awesome lectures and is working for the good of his students the class depends on the books films and short stories but its for sure fun and interesting if you put your mind and heart into it
2707,Tim  Wandling,ridiculously vague and biased there is no point in arguing with him if you disagree with him wrong he started off his first class with the statement more liberal than hillary clinton no relevance to the course but an accurate start to this class that is better off being called an hour and fifty minutes of opinions
2708,Tim  Wandling,show up and pass easy grader be sure to review powerpoint slides before tests and you will pass
2709,Tim  Wandling,tim is a really nice man and is very knowledgeable about his subject but as a teacher he is often inconsistent and frustrating a lot of reading and busy work
2710,Tim  Wandling,wandling is extrememly confusing and frustrating he use a powerpoint for most of his lectures which makes it difficult to understand what exactly you need to know for the exams you get your grades through the not him there is a lot of reading for each class and is difficult to understand at the beginning of the semester
2711,Tim  Wandling,tim is a great guy and loves what he does i had him for fye and he has different dynamics from the other teachers he was never very clear on any assignment but loves what he does and always wants to keep on track in class easy
2712,Tim  Wandling,pretty funny guy the class got off topic a lot always willing to meet students during office hours to clarify any misunderstandings i missed more than a few classes it had no affect on my grade old tries to be funny very nice understanding guy excepted my late work take his class easy a
2713,Tim  Wandling,tim is a nice guy and loves to help if asked he will assign a lot of reading if you can stay on top of that you should do fine he allows rewrites probably one the few teachers who is easy and at the same time brings out your best writing skills he is also quite interesting and brings so many ideas to discuss likes to incorporate film music
2714,Tim  Wandling,awesome teacher if you want a class that is going to push you to be a better writer take tim one of the most friendliest down to earth teachers ever had big on questioning things civil disobedience and service learning never be afraid of him he will give you all the time you need if you come to him during his freetime
2715,Tim  Wandling,very reading intensive an easy grader lots of quizzes and three major papers attendance is part of your grade we read a novel a week which makes it easy to fall behind at least the books are interesting
2716,Tim  Wandling,tim is very passionate about whatever class he is teaching but if you are not the class then it gets annoying and old fast pretty easy grader quizzes every week three paper and a final way too much reading at way too fast of a pace
2717,Tim  Wandling,tim is amazing he is always there if you have questions he is a prof that truly has the best interest of his students in mind his class was always interesting and insightful
2718,Tim  Wandling,great if you are the type of person that likes your work back right away stay away from tim he does a great job making the class interesting but is not very good at keeping the class on topic you have to be willing to read all the required material and also go see him in his office if you need help i suggest this class
2719,Tim  Wandling,nice guy not very helpful
2720,Tim  Wandling,super relaxed about deadlines and not a control freak like most professors he reminds me of my dad
2721,Tim  Wandling,not a good teacher he definitely tried though
2722,Tim  Wandling,what should have been an interesting an informative class was simply awful we rarely discussed the required reading and the concepts we were supposed to be learning brought up let alone explained i came away from this class hating theory with a passion
2723,Tim  Wandling,these classes are from before the department switched to unit courses tim was tough at times but really worked with students to ensure that they did well and understood course material
2724,Sparkle  Raymond,she is probably one of the best teachers i have ever had makes it fun she is hilarious and good at teaching she can make it interesting and gives easy tests she is helpful and very nice couldnt ask for a better teacher youll be lucky if you take one of her classes
2725,Sparkle  Raymond,wonderful wonderful highly recommened taking her marketing class i liked her so much good notes good tests and funny to boot
2726,Fred  Stewart,make sure to do the story ideas do your beats as well buy the required book most of the coursework is ap style he cancels class to give students more time to work on the assignments
2727,Fred  Stewart,if you like fred or any of his classes then there is clearly something wrong with you this is the second time had him for a class and i have no complaints just do the work and you will get an easy a make sure you talk to him amount your assignments ask him about anything so he will know you truly care and be part of the east texan
2728,Fred  Stewart,very easy class makes it very interesting only assignments no book quizzes i think but are super easy really even have to come to pass
2729,Fred  Stewart,overall this class is pretty easy his syllabus has most of the words that will be on the quiz and final is optional he assigns two papers at most throughout the whole semester even try to email him he reply one thing i like was that you know what your grade is until the last few weeks no ecollege
2730,Fred  Stewart,fred stewart is one of best professors ever had his class lectures are always interesting and keeps your attention class has easy writing assignments and tests that are easy because they cover vocabulary definitely an easy a if you put in a little effort have to take the final if your grade is high enough would take him again
2731,Fred  Stewart,the class was worth attending so many cool examples that be found anywhere else no textbook no problem two writing assignments are straightforward four quizzes are easy if you take notes and study vocab do well and you can accept your grade without worrying about a final exam
2732,Fred  Stewart,very nice professor who is always clear on his material study the syllabus and take good notes and pass the tests but only can be an easy a if you put some effort in can be an easy f if you never show up or study for the tests
2733,Fred  Stewart,this class is no doubt an easy a you pay attention and do good on the tests your good
2734,Fred  Stewart,cool class very interesting take notes on all of the items in lecture and study the syllabus handout and you will make an a he is a great professor you will really like this class did i mention no book yeah save some money
2735,Fred  Stewart,great teacher laid back helpful and really funny hes a no bs kinda teacher and will give you extra time if you need it
2736,Fred  Stewart,fred is the best i have to disagree with whoever said he give stuff back because i have gotten everything back very quickly in both of the classes i have him for he is very laid back and is always willing to help if you ask easy for sure
2737,Fred  Stewart,you never get anything back from fred so you have no clue if you are doing good or not and he cancels calss more and more as the semester goes on
2738,Fred  Stewart,if you come to class take notes on the items and spend maybe minutes looking over your notes and study guide before the test you will make a a this class is a must take uni studies course and a great gpa booster
2739,Fred  Stewart,going to this class is a joke just stay at home and write articles all the time also you have to write more than what is just on the syllabus that alone get you an a stewart is a great guy but you learn anything about reporting in the class you just have to write on your own
2740,Fred  Stewart,fred is the man take the notes ever thing that he covers on the screen in will be on his test his the best guy that teaches listen and you can get that a due those assignments its only you have a month on each well recommeded
2741,Fred  Stewart,if you go to class and do the easy assignments this is an easy a not a hard class tests are easy strongly recommend
2742,Fred  Stewart,too easy for my liking i suppose this is why our journalism department is so laughable but whom am i to complain it is free credits if you are looking for pure and instant blowoff congrats you have it
2743,Fred  Stewart,is this even a college class i could have made an when i was very easy class a must to take
2744,Fred  Stewart,take jour for one of your university studies courses it is a fun easy class and mr stewart is awesome
2745,Fred  Stewart,mr stewart is so awesome one of the best professors ever taken he cares he helps and very interested in his students wellbeing also fun on tipa trips
2746,David  Gallaher,ochem is a difficult class dr.g focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there although this may not be efficient for most students he really wants you to succeed he makes it possible to earn on at least one of the exams we got lucky for this is huge he wants you to try you slack you fail
2747,David  Gallaher,ochem is a difficult class dr.g focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there although this may not be efficient for most students he really wants you to succeed he makes it possible to earn on at least one of the exams we got lucky for this is huge he wants to do you to try you slack you fail
2748,David  Gallaher,i regretted taken class with him he is just horrible it is very hard to apply what he taught in class on exams not a fair grader coming to his class does not worth with bcos you can not apply what he teaches in class on exams and home work i will never advise anyone to take his class he will mess up your gpa his labs grading are worst
2749,David  Gallaher,dr g has gotten hot over the years and the clicking of the pen is even hotter great you regret it good luck
2750,David  Gallaher,dr gallaher is an unfair grader he will not follow his grading key he will not return assignments from your first semester until your second semester so if you end up with a c you will have no idea why he also has made students feel stupid when they ask him question and has had to apologize it
2751,David  Gallaher,if you can get to him on a good day he can be kind and helpful but on a bad day he is rather condescending and makes you feel like a complete idiot he makes really weird and boarding on inappropriate jokes his tests are really tough and there is never enough time for examples in class he is also a very slow grader when it comes to lab reports
2752,David  Gallaher,gallaher is an awesome professor the course content is not easy but he makes it bearable he is very funny and cracks jokes frequently i really respect him as a professor while you the grading is not the quickest he provides very individualized feedback and it makes the wait worth it if you need help outside of his course he will provide it
2753,David  Gallaher,he teaches organic chemistry it is kind of hard to make organic appealing but he finds a way he has a funny sense of humor the class is hard but it is due to the subject material itself he is always there if you need help his tests are extremely difficult but he tries to be as helpful as possible one of the nicest professor at carlow
2754,David  Gallaher,s great professor who genuinely cares about his students he talks to people who talk to him so that can sometimes be misconstrued as favoritism he teaches organic a difficult subject very well real and does not beat around the bush which is nice
2755,David  Gallaher,first off he is definitely not hot ew secondly he is a decent teacher but he picks favorites and makes it blatantly obvious who those individuals are his criticisms on are harsh rude and not helpful in one word arrogant
2756,David  Gallaher,he is very helpful in class but he will grade your labs very strict he will also leave rude comments on everything he grades
2757,David  Gallaher,he is the best
2758,David  Gallaher,he wants people to learn but it can be difficult to learn what to do
2759,David  Gallaher,he is very smart and knows what he is talking about ochem was something i knew nothing about but i left loving it his only downside is that he chooses favorites and is very arrogant he was also very unorganized in handing back if you can deal with that it is very worth your time to take his course
2760,David  Gallaher,he is an amazing professor with great people skills if you are confused about anything he can clear it up for you within minutes of his office hours take him if you are a chem major it will also help in the long run he is full of very informative advice
2761,David  Gallaher,no comments
2762,David  Gallaher,he is a great instructor i suck at the class though and it is mad hard and sometimes makes me want to kill myself and everytime there is a test i get sick i think it is because of the ulcer i got from being stressed but i am getting through it and getting the extra help i need
2763,David  Gallaher,wonderful man too bad getting married
2764,David  Gallaher,yes his class is hard but he teaches the material very well it is a difficult course to keep up with but if you slack off too much and ask for help when you need it be fine
2765,David  Gallaher,hard as hell but i learned a lot
2766,Roberta  Nye,she really teach mostly watching movies on the chapters and the movies are boring she grades really easily the assignments are easy
2767,Roberta  Nye,horrible zero effort in teaching the class stupid movie after stupid movie
2768,Roberta  Nye,there are a total of grades she grades easy because she care the tests are true or false if you want an easy a take this class if not you learn anything of importance in this class
2769,Roberta  Nye,this class was pretty fun and she graded so easily really nice professor by the way
2770,Roberta  Nye,no comments
2771,Roberta  Nye,this is the biggest farce of a class that i have ever seen and how can it even be considered a class if always cancelled nice prof but not a good one
2772,Kenny  Peters,an awesome professor if you pay attention and copy all his class notes you can easily get an a in his class we had a quiz every friday about questions and tests in total he does assign homework but just so you can get extra practice and he even grade it i will definitely take him again
2773,Kenny  Peters,the worst class i have ever taken attend tutoring twice a week in addition to seeking outside help very condescending after asking to go over a homework question during the allotted time he responded by saying i believe you asked to go over that overall rude and not helpful at all
2774,Kenny  Peters,his exams are way harder than his quizzes and the homework he assigns i got and on all his quizzes i went to tutoring a week and to peer study sessions once a week i went to him for help and was told that he expect much from his students and he understand why struggling i attended every lecture
2775,Kenny  Peters,this was the hardest most stressful class i have ever had
2776,Kenny  Peters,i took cc102 with mr peters honestly the only reason why i passed is because the class is basically common sense he is knowledgeable and excited about the subject but he talks more than teaches his notes always align with the book his logic grading is confusing he talks fast and lacks enough patience to teach a class avoid him
2777,Kenny  Peters,i thought i would be taking precalclus but apparently i am taking middle school math i am not in any way prepared to move onto calculus i next semester we spent more than half of this semester completing basic review and he even commented in class that we have spent three times the amount of time on review than the book recommended
2778,Kenny  Peters,extremely picky grader he takes points off for lack of punctuation on math problems he is easily agitated and has no problem talking down to people and making nasty or passiveaggressive remarks the worst part is that the material he teaches leaves you completely unprepared for the courses you need to take after avoid him
2779,Kenny  Peters,horrible teacher he was confusing and boring he graded weird really was not considerate if you did not understand dont take him
2780,Kenny  Peters,doctor peters is a fabulous math teacher although he is a ridiculously picky grader as long as you follow his format on the board and make sure to copy it directly in your notes so that you can mimick it for you should be okay funny too
2781,Kenny  Peters,i thought this class was easy but i am amazing at math but even if you good at math he makes sure that everyone understands going on
2782,Kenny  Peters,he can come off a bit arrogant but he is always willing to go the extra mile and help you as long as respectful work with you
2783,Kenny  Peters,the worst professor ever had.i went into his class expecting a lot because other students raved about him what a mistake arrogant and napoleanic
2784,Kenny  Peters,tests are pretty easy but he can be stingy with points he so boring though
2785,Kenny  Peters,intelligent organized has a contageous enthusiasm somehow makes difficult or boring concepts approachable interesting will review concepts right before quizzes when students are confused straightforward testing but a bit of a stickler on studentfriendly grading points system
2786,Kenny  Peters,made statistics easy and understandable if you are not math literate i would suggest you take him
2787,Kenny  Peters,dr peters is a fabulous professor anyone that can make calculus understandable deserves a gold star he has a lot of enthusiam for the subject matter he is a very nice person and always willing to help if needed clearly this is a very intelligent man i love dr peters
2788,Kenny  Peters,mr peters is a good guy he is really enthusiastic about quanitative reasoning and gives really good and as many as you need examples i was never good at any math and i dreaded taking this at but telling you take mr peters if you a math person it will make your semester easier
2789,Kenny  Peters,no comments
2790,Kenny  Peters,dr peters is a nice guy and his classes are pretty easy i learn much but each class was a new adventure
2791,Kenny  Peters,ken was the best math teacher i have ever had he makes math so much easier and makes learning fun thanks ken
2792,Jj  Wilson,jj made you work hard but she was so knowledgeable i learned a lot she cared about whether her students were doing well even though she seemed strict and tough to talk with she was pretty easy to talk to once you initiated it and she would bring scones for am classes and snacks and tea for pm classes
2793,Jj  Wilson,no comments
2794,Jj  Wilson,i love jj i took her for every class that i could she was like a grandmother she brought tea and snacks to class and allowed you to really be able to sit back and enjoy english and literature without having to stress out about your next paper
2795,Jj  Wilson,one of the greatest teachers at ssu extrememly knowledgeable and pushed students to their potential also quirky and fun bring juice and scones to am classes and tea and cookies to pm classes
2796,Jj  Wilson,lots of writing but a nice lady who loves teaching and is definitely spunky
2797,Jj  Wilson,she seemed really laid back in class but if you visited her in her office she made you feel stupid and inept encouraged passion in her class had some spunk
2798,Jj  Wilson,no comments
2799,Jj  Wilson,no comments
2800,Laura  Colbert,i dreaded speech class and laura made it fun as long as you follow her grade sheet which is very clearly laid out on what she wants get an a you do need to know your speech a wonderful teacher i miss her class even though speech is my number one fear
2801,Laura  Colbert,took this as an week class two chapters a week and two quizzes a week pretty straight forward and you do have to do the reading if you want to do well on the the written portions of the quizzes there is one long paper do by the end of the class and i suggest you do not procrastinate on it like i did it takes a long time
2802,Laura  Colbert,she is a very friendly and enthusiastic teacher really easy class just had to give four speeches and take two online tests easy grader cancels class or ends early a lot so it would be good to take her last in the day an issue some people might have is she talks about your speech right after you do it in front of the class
2803,Laura  Colbert,took this online as an weeker relatively easy class keep up with the work and you will be fine teacher seemed nice via emails had no other contact with her final project takes a while so get started early interesting course i enjoyed it
2804,Laura  Colbert,great teacher who definitely does not get enough credit for er efforts to teach students
2805,Laura  Colbert,treats students more like friends than pupils i needed a teacher and not a friend at times hard to follow take with caution
2806,Laura  Colbert,a giant critic teaches the class as if she is constantly getting high on her powers to critique and judge rather than teaching the students to learn she teaches the students to memorize and judges based on how well the instructions are memorized may be describe as cool but as far as a teacher goes i recommend
2807,Laura  Colbert,everybody has to take speech aarggh thankfully i got a great teacher she was very encouraging and got the class to encourage each gotta do the work but she helps you and always keeps on top of reminding you when due which helps a bit scatterbrained sometimes
2808,Laura  Colbert,took an online speech class with her need to read the whole book but the material was easy to read she is readily available for questions awesome teacher
2809,Laura  Colbert,this teacher rocks i had zero interest in going to this class but i learned much with her stage material outlines she is very supportive of everyone and tries to get you to be a good speaker one of the best teachers i have had and i would take this class again in a second i have used her outlines for other classes for presentations
2810,Laura  Colbert,i took this class over the summer cuz i heard you have to do less speeches and you do only i was so scared going into it but it really wasnt that bad like i said speeches and tests right out of the book she can be pretty harsh but she still gives you a good grade as long as you have the written wrok done how she wants it easy class
2811,Laura  Colbert,cool teacher funny and you may actually learn something in her class if you play attention and participate i got a grade from her yet so my fingers are still crossed
2812,Laura  Colbert,i had her for class and at first she was cool but then i had to miss class for health reasons and she went bullistic i would not suggest her unless you think u can turn in every assignment be on time to every class and never ever miss a class
2813,Laura  Colbert,she is very fun teacher can be a little tough but nothing we deal with speaches are not too hard good advice choose the topicks you care about otherwise she gets upset i would recommend to take her class she also lets you out of the classroom earlier
2814,Laura  Colbert,speech assigments are pretty basic however i do not like being graded in front of other students i would prefer a basic thank you and sit down she goes on and on about all of the negative things about the speech she was more interested in theatre then speech take this class unless you have thick skin
2815,Laura  Colbert,she is an egomaniac and she is crazy unclear never holds office hours never seems to know where she is going when she teaches i suggest avoiding her
2816,Laura  Colbert,a very nice teacher and i have a lot of the same views on life and the fine arts as she does she may be really tough at times but only because she wants to make you the best you possibly can be
2817,Laura  Colbert,no comments
2818,Laura  Colbert,no comments
2819,Laura  Colbert,she is really selfcentered care about her students at all and talks negitively about them in class she gives bad grades to people who do the work and work hard and others who care about the class she gives them excellent grades take her be making the biggest mistake
2820,Paul  Nacozy,his lectures are boring and just talk does hand out notes his test are amazing not easy but well made you can reason out questions and he will accept them if your reasoning is sound not a my way or the high way teacher as long as you prove your answer learn the fundamentals of physics by heart and you will pass his class
2821,Paul  Nacozy,expect very poor comprehension in this course grading is very rough
2822,Paul  Nacozy,his notes help you on exams
2823,Paul  Nacozy,kinda rude if you ask him for help and not sympathetic at all
2824,Paul  Nacozy,took this class in summer i cannot recommend anyone to submit themselves to the hellish confusion and utter futility that pervade this classroom
2825,Paul  Nacozy,the good he gives you the notes and the sample problems the bad is that the lectures are dull and less exciting than just reading the book he has a particular way that you have to work problems on test but does not use that method when showing problems all of your points lost will be format errors not cause you understand the subject
2826,Paul  Nacozy,hard to stay awake and pay attention too much material to go through to prepare for tests would not take him again unless you absolutely have to or if this is the only class taking take him
2827,Paul  Nacozy,our class signed a petition against the way he teaches to give to the school board it was a challenge to pay attention for more than minutes i had to repeat my question to him times once until i was almost screaming
2828,Paul  Nacozy,i found myself more worried about following his way then actually learning the material the problems that he works out on the board would be counted wrong in his exams he avoids doing problems his way because its a waste of time but yet still expects you to do it his way the class is fine just chose a different instructor
2829,Paul  Nacozy,omg there was of us to start and its weeks into the semester and theres only of us left lets see how many will be left at the end of sem my bet is
2830,Paul  Nacozy,so many problems know how to teach cant hear the student asking questions takes whole class to do problem forces us to solve the long and hard way if not done like how he done it minus i took phys soph high school and i have gpa so no im not stupid his class is just horrible acc needs to fire him immediately
2831,Paul  Nacozy,prepare to do a lot of outside study to learn anything in this class all lectures are just powerpoint slides and frequently have mistakes in them he takes off points on hw tests for things like not showing work on basic math and not using the exact format he uses on formulas he also has a hard time understanding any questions people ask
2832,Paul  Nacozy,take this class to fail
2833,Paul  Nacozy,the professor teaches in a boring approach its all powerpoints he wants your work to be done exactly how he does it i like physics but im not learning despite the hours spent studying there are only students left in class he gives out a lot of handouts which he revises constantly i do not advice anyone to take him
2834,Paul  Nacozy,homework may be miss of one question lose points.not even wrong just show your work or work a different way than what was shown.spends the class doing problems only to almost from the class tells him what he did wrong and he starts over.more than the class dropped before the test
2835,Paul  Nacozy,i am a junior from tsu and he is beyond a doubt the worst prof i have ever heard thinks that he must teach at the mit level takes his responsibility way to seriously and truely just doesnt know how to explain the subject i mistakingly thought i could just teach my self and go to the tutoring you have to be a master to pass
2836,Paul  Nacozy,the class was fine you are allowed to take notes into the exams so long as you put in the hours to prepare there is no problem
2837,Paul  Nacozy,the worst teacher i have every had i took him for engineering physic spends to much time going over the note that he did not even write himself and do no help does not explain himself well his test are super hard no one got higher then there were students when the semester started and only people were left when the semester ended
2838,Paul  Nacozy,dont take him
2839,Paul  Nacozy,it would take him the whole class time to work one problem seen him target the folks that may seem trouble makers he grabbed this girl by the arm and took her outside he thought she was being disrubtive but she was asking her neighbor a question.one a good note he will let you make up his labs and sometimes get away homework
2840,Vic  Timmer,a great really blame him for doing so poorly on the final exam i agree with the previous comment you really need to know your stuff for the midterm exams as he does not tell you anything at all still one of the better had very energetic lectures making soil seem somewhat interesting goodluck if you have him
2841,Vic  Timmer,timmer is very nice and seems to know a lot although his lectures contain much actual information one reservation i had though was that he gave us a practise test for the final and it have been any more different from the actual final why even bother
2842,Vic  Timmer,i dropped this class timmer a terrible professor and a nice passionate guy but his expectations are unclear if you take one of his classes know everything from the textbook even if he says otherwise his test questions are very specific
2843,John  Curran,great teacher very clear and super intelligent kind and cute i learned a lot
2844,John  Curran,awesome teacher no textbook no written assignments no tests speeches outlines and you r done take him for your speech classes
2845,John  Curran,easy grader but make sure if he says full pages that it is full pages you must see plays during the semester and write a small review lots of notes like pages a class period he gives study guides and take attendance great teacher
2846,John  Curran,very passionaite and understanding teacher extemely fair
2847,John  Curran,he is an awesome teacher no homework except for outlines and outside reports he teach you stuff u need to know you get out of class early a lot of times to prepare for speeches he is very helpful in explaining how to become a better speaker
2848,John  Curran,great guy knows what hes talking about easy going easy a if you come to class but needs to lose beatnik style
2849,John  Curran,sometimes he very understanding of certain situations but as a teacher he was awesome very clear and very supportive
2850,John  Curran,very cool guy really easy going and teach you stuff you need to know for the class
2851,John  Curran,no comments
2852,Craig  Stettner,craig is such an awesome teacher the content isnt easy to begin with but he makes it better he cares about his students that is for sure kind of nerdy but in the best way take him you wont regret it
2853,Craig  Stettner,zoology was the best course taken so far across different colleges it difficult to pass at all was extremely interesting the classroom is loaded with specimens craig is an amazing professor and just a pleasant person to be around in general dress for the weather as you should be prepared for outdoor excursions at any time
2854,Craig  Stettner,i love craig his zoology class was really interesting and so adorable in a sweet nerdy way honestly my favorite teacher ever had i just love his personality however his class was extremely hard for me i ended up getting a c and they was a miracle the tests where you had to identify species by their scientific names were horrid
2855,Craig  Stettner,professor stettner has a wide variety of knowledge about species from fish plants animals etc he takes the time to explain important concepts and is approachable by office hours or email if you have issues if you are not the best at science or not a good student there is more than enough extra credit to keep your grade in good standing
2856,Craig  Stettner,craig is amazing at first find him quirky and different but he grows on you i made the mistake of missing lecture a lot and that really affected my grade because each lecture he grades and gives points for participation he does offer a lot of extra credit and his discussions are outdoor and super hands on we did a lot good experience
2857,Craig  Stettner,i loved class such a nice teacher and you can really learn a lot if you pay attention plus the outdoor days where great
2858,Craig  Stettner,craig is my absolute favorite teacher of all time i have taken zoology and man environment with him and i am going on his field bio class to costa rica this winter zoology means a lot of memorizing but he gives a ton of extra credit on the tests and in the class in general so it is easy to do well man environment was the easiest class ever
2859,Craig  Stettner,hands down my favorite biology professor would recommend you get a lot of extra credit and its just an overall fun class you go outside for most of your labs craig is so understanding everyone loves the guy
2860,Craig  Stettner,craig really is awesome he gives a ton of extra credit and really does care about what he teaches it is seriously impossible to fail the class if you show up and do some extra credit take this class if you can he really is awesome i am taking one of his classes again next semester
2861,Craig  Stettner,awsome guy very smart and passionate about the world gives a ton of extra credit impossible to fail with all the extra credit
2862,Craig  Stettner,craig is amazing a really cool guy and knows what talking about there are tests total which are hard but he gives over extra credit so like one bad test happen man environment so you do go out almost everyday but i loved it it was so fun and interactive great teacher passionate and cares
2863,Craig  Stettner,i took this class during the summer we went outside almost every single day to walk along the lake in the sometimes to do some very messy activities going to class outside earns you participation pts he is not very good at conveying material in class so you need to read the book to do well on exams there is lots of memorizing
2864,Craig  Stettner,craig is an awesome teacher you can really tell he is passionate about what he teaches also the class is a bit hard exams but there is so much extra credit you can still pass with a good grade you also do go outside a lot but a lot of fun this was my favorite class professor and i wish i could take it again
2865,Craig  Stettner,absolutely in love with his job and studies very enthusiastic about the subject matter and lots of opportunities to get hands on beware of skipping out on lab or classes though tests often cover material that is not in the textbook does give tons of points in the way of inclass activities
2866,Craig  Stettner,me stettnar is a really good teacher his lectures are very understanding
2867,Craig  Stettner,he comes off weird at first but get used to it he knows his stuff and truly so nice he offers a lot of extra credit and chances to do them so he wants you to pass you can do bad on the exam and still pass the class with a b with all the extra credit opportunity he crams a lot of questions on the exams too
2868,Craig  Stettner,craig is an amazing teacher probably my favorite and i do not like science classes quirky and a little weird at first but you will love him by the end hilarious do not take bio if you do not like going outside because that is all you do if you do like going outside an easy a no homework except to read study for tests
2869,Craig  Stettner,craig stettner is awesome i did not want to take a science class at all but he definitely made it worth my while he offers so much extra credit over points i got on tests but still ended with an a in the class every lecture he gives you exercises which are nice grade boosters expect to go outside craig is really nice and helpful
2870,Craig  Stettner,this class was so much fun expect to go outside alot the tests are hard but he gives so much extra credit impossible to fail just a great guy and loves nature
2871,Craig  Stettner,professor sterner is he best he is the nicest man i have ever met he truly cares about his students and only wants them to do well i would take his class again anyway and i am not even smart in science we go outside when its nice out and his extra credit projects are so much fun
2872,Todd  Ballantyne,he is by far my favorite teacher at this school he may seem cold at first but he is so caring and understanding with each student as long as you put in the effort you can pass with an easy a
2873,Todd  Ballantyne,this is a great class to take for people with no previous experience he will help you get through every speech tests are so easy as long as you put in effort and show up youll be fine
2874,Todd  Ballantyne,one of the best professors i have ever had he gives good feedback has an upbeat personality and will help you out with any difficulties he makes his lectures interesting and puts you at ease when presenting a speech which especially helps for the anxious his study guides for tests are terrific and i highly recommend him
2875,Todd  Ballantyne,communications majors this is the one to take you will learn so much he is highly skilled and really cares about making you a better speaker best instructor hands down
2876,Todd  Ballantyne,im terrified of public speaking and after this class i cannot say i am less so but mr.b is a caring prof who really wants you to do well the comments saying to just try wrong an easy grader and i should have gotten a b cause of my exam scores but ended up with an a anyways also happened to a friend of mine just try and pass
2877,Todd  Ballantyne,he has us to a lot of speeches quizzes bought books but only used one is an okay grader would choose someone else
2878,Todd  Ballantyne,i feel like i actually had to work for the a in this class for both the exams and the speech so if you are taking a lot of classes and you want an easy a for speech i suggest you take this class over the summer because you are required to work hard for the a also you have to practice for the speech to get a good grade as well as read the book
2879,Todd  Ballantyne,very approachable professor understands that public speaking can be nervous to many so he harsh when he gives criticism his grading is easy to understand overall practice your speeches ahead of time so that be in a good spot there are a few exams as well so you do have to read some chapters if you want to do well on those
2880,Todd  Ballantyne,he makes you feel at ease and his grading method is clear and precise he is also very approachable i highly recommend him if you have never taken speech and super nervous about it
2881,Todd  Ballantyne,really good professor he cares about his students and always wants them to improve he knows everyone fears of public speaking but he makes the class a friendly environment tests are easy never opened the purple book i used the white one to help me with our speech outlines very kind you have free absence passes if you go over you fail
2882,Todd  Ballantyne,he generously grades speeches even if they are bad and understands public speaking is hard he wants you to succeed and was my first professor in college to see good in me the tests are easy as long as you read the book learned so much in this class so if you take spe101 be sure to take him ask about extra credit i got points added
2883,Todd  Ballantyne,took spe at my home place almost passed but no luck had to repeat it at harper thought the course would be a joke wow i was wrong professor b is the dude to take prof b is dope he makes you learn how to speak publically and then you grow confidence and stuff lot of hands on in front of everyone be prepared you will learn a ton from him
2884,Todd  Ballantyne,overall great teacher make sure to read the book and do the study guides before each test the tests get harder and harder
2885,Todd  Ballantyne,mr b is a very good speech professor he understands most of his students hate public speaking but he just wants you to do your best some of his lectures are painfully boring but listening to someone talk about speaking tactics fun anywhere show up for your speeches on time and do fine
2886,Todd  Ballantyne,mr ballantyne is an amazing teacher you are allowed to miss six classes without it effecting your grade there are to speeches as long as you keep improving and meet the required time get an a or b just do not miss the day of your speech because you can not make it up you will receive a zero very kind and caring wants you to pass
2887,Todd  Ballantyne,mr b is very enthusiastic about speech he loves what he does and it shows hes very easy to talk to and will give you feedback on his thoughts of your speech he creates a comfortable environment in his classroom so when you go up to speak it isnt scary you must show up to his class or you wont pass he keeps track of attendance
2888,Todd  Ballantyne,great professor really helped me out with every little detail of my speech and seem to rest until we both knew it was the best i could do very great professor and a very great man
2889,Todd  Ballantyne,i have extreme anxiety when it come to talking in front of people and it easy but mr b is a very generous grader and just wants you to do your best if someone with anxiety like me can pass this class with an a than anyone can take speech with mr b
2890,Todd  Ballantyne,mr b is the best speech professor anywhere i hate public speaking but mr b made us feel comfortable and laid back he grades on improvement not by expectation meaning if you do poorly on one speech but try harder and do better on the next one he will take that improvement into account and boost your grade he just wants to see you try
2891,Todd  Ballantyne,professor ballantyne was a great first speech teacher to have class was mostly lecture preparing you for speeches then giving speeches and there were tests for the semester on lecture and the book since class was all lecture it was not fun but is speech class fun no you have to show up pay attention and try hard and your best on speechs
2892,Linda  Burns,classes are very boring and she is not very nice if you have to miss her class she was very rude to me and was not understandable at all i would not recommend her
2893,Linda  Burns,dr burns may be unorganized but she really tries to make the material interesting and has a lot of unique knowledge about working class backgrounds she is also very approachable and is interested in different student perspectives the video choices of hers are also great
2894,Linda  Burns,had to take almost all of her classes for my major she is the worst she is late for almost every class unorganized and rude her classes are boring and she knows about what she teaches from books no personal exp she is also a bad advisor
2895,Linda  Burns,very interesting class nobody really participated in class except for a select few she is disorganized do not expect your grades back a week after the due date maybe a month later very easy midterm and assignments easy a
2896,Linda  Burns,if you need organization in a class she will not be the teacher for you she is very disorganized and just rambles on about the material she does not give back assignments on time either i personaly learned nothing in this class
2897,Linda  Burns,take this professor
2898,Linda  Burns,no comments
2899,Linda  Burns,i was unsure at first but this clas tured out to be a lot of fun the professor worked hard at making sure the class got the concepts of teach social studies however if you need a lot of structure and organization in your classes this one for you but if you like to learn in a more relaxed free flowing manner give it a try
2900,Linda  Burns,she was a good teacher but i felt that she forced her feminist views on me a little bit too much i am not sure how she feels about men but i like men so please lay off the guybashing
2901,Richard  Wilkins,narrow students stand his defense of family amid a torrent of moral relativism the mainstream sheep protecting the harder ground arrogant rather delightfully vulnerable
2902,Richard  Wilkins,if you get him for con law or any class really be prepared to learn everything yourself as his lecture adds nothing really irritating man
2903,Richard  Wilkins,prof wilkins is an intelligent man he constantly expresses his conservative views even when it was not relevant to the class discussion will gave grade boosts to students he recognizes would recommend going to office
2904,Richard  Wilkins,other comments posted are bunk although he is conservative he is very respectful of students who offer opposing views since con law is convoluted inconsistent and contradictory wilkins presents it as clearly it is
2905,Richard  Wilkins,arrogant narrowminded selfloathing closeted gentleman who thinks the smartest guy ever born women count for anything except babies and casserole and is on a mission to prove it to every one of his students
2906,Richard  Wilkins,articulate and capable but has a very narrow conservative point of view it is his way or nothing legend has it that he has the highest gpa in the law history and plans to keep it that way
2907,Richard  Wilkins,theatrical entertaining style but is not open to real discussion of views that counter his john birchlike constitutional theories i have to read outside class to learn real constituation law
2908,Tressa  Crehan,she is one of the best dance teachers i have ever had very clear and very helpful
2909,Tressa  Crehan,tressa is the kindest teacher in the department an easy grader and is very patient with people who struggle she is also just adorable in general such a kindhearted person
2910,Tressa  Crehan,patient and concise
2911,Tressa  Crehan,i love tressa she has brought out the dancer in me that has been dying to come out she is very helpful and encouraging i wish the dance department offered nonmajors class on a regular basis
2912,Tressa  Crehan,fun fun fun fun
2913,Tressa  Crehan,tressa is a lot of fun to work with very encouraging which is a good thing if falling behind in the class made the class bearable
2914,Tressa  Crehan,gotta love tressa the best
2915,Tressa  Crehan,not the best tries
2916,Richard  Burns,he is a great teacher i love him
2917,Richard  Burns,i love this teacher i took three semesters with him if i have any math class i will take with him with pleasure
2918,Richard  Burns,great teacher and person
2919,Richard  Burns,he was amazingg
2920,Richard  Burns,one of the best math professors there are
2921,Richard  Burns,i took professor burns for calc ii this professor really knows his stuff he is very funny and is willing to explain to you until you understands the material he give practice test before exam and it goes over if you study the practice test you will pass the exam recorded his lecture posted on youtube any time you could access and review
2922,Richard  Burns,prof burns absolutely loves to help students with math he will spend as much time as you need to help you understand it he offers multiple ways of solving a problem lets you decide what works for you he always makes you feel good about learning something keeps you interested during the class does not call on you if you dont want to be
2923,Richard  Burns,awesome professor
2924,Richard  Burns,burns is amazing if all people learned math from burns from start to finish we would all be math wizards give you the shirt off his back to help you out great guy and great professor i wish i could take more classes with him tests are easier than the homework labs help with understanding and boost your grade a great experience
2925,Richard  Burns,awesome professor really knows his stuff
2926,Richard  Burns,great teacher math is one of those subjects i hate the most but prof burns helped me understand it in matters of minutes made it much more simpler thanks professor burns we need more professors like you
2927,Richard  Burns,an awesome teacher best math teacher ever had
2928,Richard  Burns,so i just want to say that burns is an awesome teacher no doubt about it his love of math makes the class interesting you know he enjoys what he does from the way he acts he is always smiling and is very easy going he has solved difficult problems in front of the class very impressive side note he is an avid player of chess pretty cool
2929,Richard  Burns,best teacher every makes sure everyone understands before moving on he the only math teacher i have had that made math seem fun
2930,Richard  Burns,great prof helped me through one of my toughest subjects math his explaining was alot better then the book he gave us
2931,Richard  Burns,this professor is the best i have seen yet he cares so much about you passing the class that he will stop teaching just to make sure you get the problem correct he makes mathematics simple and fun there is no way you can leave this class confused or angry he always puts a smile on your face professors should learn his style of teaching
2932,Richard  Burns,he is an amazing teacher i always struggled with math and thought i hated it he makes me excited about math and it is now my favorite subject he is one of those teachers you want to stay connected with the best
2933,Richard  Burns,he is an awesome professor i ever have
2934,Richard  Burns,best teacher everr
2935,Richard  Burns,prof burns is honestly the best teacher ever come across at stcc amazing and helps you out as much as he can he understands the students and is very flexible i recommend everyone takes him
2936,Jeffrey  Sawyer,awesome professor his class are tough be expected to read and analyze the material because the questions on mid terms and final exams are not going to directly jump out at you unless you actually read read the material he is a honest person and he is understandable unlike some professors so just be honest with him and you will do fine
2937,Jeffrey  Sawyer,awesome professor i loved his approach to teaching we did have a surprise group project which was not on the syllabus but i liked that he graded on individual contributions because some people were just terrible he was great wit answering questions and clarifying topics and he participated in the forums along with the students take him
2938,Jeffrey  Sawyer,took him back in the early for english legal history courses and one other i forget at the time loved the classes at the time got some of my best undergrad work out of me then again his courses inspired my illfated and short lived law school career so not sure if i should recommend him or not
2939,Jeffrey  Sawyer,smart helpful and fair professor expect to be entertained but those are some tough subjects to make interesting
2940,Jeffrey  Sawyer,his class is boring but how can anyone make english law interesting especially during the and class his test are diffcult so are his papers but he does give you a clear direction of where to go
2941,Jeffrey  Sawyer,would contemplate slitting my wrists during his class just for entertainment to keep me awake so boring
2942,Jeffrey  Sawyer,sawyer taught some and had us in study groups some he was very lax about attendance grading seemed fair we had papers but no tests in history of english law from to
2943,Jeffrey  Sawyer,professor sawyer was a great and enthusiastic teacher very helpful in guiding you in the right direction
2944,Jeffrey  Sawyer,great professor enjoyed his class i felt he was very fair about grading
2945,Jeffrey  Sawyer,very knowledgeable but all over the place it help that he wrote the book the only real study group i had in undergrad and that was so we could teach the material to ourselves smart but i feel like he can convey the material his tests are also difficult but fair
2946,Jeffrey  Sawyer,the class i took with him was christian history and dr sawyer did a great job of hitting the main points and keeping class discussion on track there was a fair bit of reading a few short papers one big paper and no tests a cool guy very knowledgeable and a thinker he does talk quietly so ask him to repeat if you hear
2947,Jeffrey  Sawyer,nice guy class was boring i took it for a filler not a law student might have been the problem very helpful and candid with his students course was just boring mostly reading ye olde english lawe records like shakespeare without the drama very dry cool guy though
2948,Jeffrey  Sawyer,no comments
2949,Jeffrey  Sawyer,very intelligent and knowledgable about his topic but somewhat confusing could have been the content of the course
2950,Rhoda  Jost,there was a major lack of communication with this professor she did not return emails and seemed very confused about grading i would not recommend her if you can find another professor for this class go with it she takes weeks to grade and is very last minute about it i paid for her class and yet was never able to communicate with her
2951,Rhoda  Jost,not a bad prof but recommend she messed with bb grades and entered wrong grades was a pain due to doing it at end of sem easy b gotta work a lil for the a
2952,Rhoda  Jost,she will keep you busy but it help you on the test
2953,Rhoda  Jost,i took the week course online pro.jost gives a test review for midterm and final you look up answers on your own this only covers of exam expect a lack of communication and late grading
2954,Rhoda  Jost,med term online easy course prof jost is completely hands off she does not respond to phone calls or email takes several weeks to grade assignments
2955,Rhoda  Jost,professor jost is awesome this is a difficult class but not hard if you apply yourself and do the work my only criticism is that this could really be an online class you come to class open blackboard on projector read powerpoint from blackboard verbatim go home north campus the most conveniently located
2956,Rhoda  Jost,mrs self proclaimed medical terminology wizard needs to attend a course on common courtesy she comes off as arrogant and will not return calls i think she even makes up some of the acronyms used if you are already pretty fluent in med term and need a somewhat easy class then take this class if not look elsewhere
2957,Rhoda  Jost,in order to be successful you have to be able to do the work on your own her test material come from all over the place and are unpredictable her study guides are useless because she do not test what is on them she is hard to get a hold of and never returns calls or emails hybrid course tests are in testing center outside of classtime
2958,Rhoda  Jost,this class was absolutely horrible took her over the summer as a hybrid class no one could ever get ahold of her not even our lab teacher when the tests were actually graded they were graded by her assistant and graded incorrectly im still waiting on my final grade to be posted which was due yesterday by noon
2959,Rhoda  Jost,she was a great teacher and would help anyone on her own time
2960,Rhoda  Jost,this teacher is usless if you are trying to learn she is very smart i giver her that but as a teacher useless her lectures were nothing to do with the test most of the time the notes she handed out were very confusing and useless you never knew what was going to be on the test basically she just is not teacher material
2961,Rhoda  Jost,this professor is useless had her for the online portion of micro and it was hell you know whats going to be on the test and it an online class but you do all the test in labs lab test and she put your grades up on blackboard after the test take her run
2962,Rhoda  Jost,ms jost helpful at all as a matter of fact still waiting on grades promised earlier stay away
2963,Rhoda  Jost,very frustrating teacher had a hybrid with her and she respond to email no phone calls back we only got our grades after ms thompson got on to her for not grading tests not sure what it is doing behind the scenes but she needs to use better time management or work less teaching avoid her ms thompson rocks
2964,Rhoda  Jost,i would not take her again she taught the online portion for the hybrid class but not the lab this makes it difficult because like different classes she never responds to emails and doesnt answer her phone you never know what is going to be on the test so you have to study everything since you cannot get ahold of her to find out
2965,Rhoda  Jost,this is a hybrid class she will email you within days of you sending it.tests are multiply choice and given at the beginning of class and then you will take the lab quiz the reference materials are too numberous making it difficult to gauge what might be on the test absorb as much as you can or be sorry on test day
2966,Rhoda  Jost,had her for online mcb2010c she will not reply to your email so get used to that her tests come from three different sources so prepare to study
2967,Rhoda  Jost,she is a very interesting teacher a little on the nutty side buy very inteligent she has a habit of geting off subject but she grades and test fairly expect alot of reading and homework time to get an a in her class though
2968,Rhoda  Jost,i made an a in the class but i had some med term experience before i took this class she is a good teacher she give practice tests which are similar to the midterm and final but there is alot of memorization so if you do not like to study take this course
2969,Rhoda  Jost,very understanding helpful and eager to teach many classes were cancelled this term due to various issues getting both her programs reaccredited and an unfortunate situation with her loved one no big deal read your chapters and be fine she simplifies everything if you pass this class you pass anyone
2970,Brandie  Siegfried,one of the most enriching classes i have taken during my undergrad dr siegfried cares not only about her students but about their academic achievement and challenges you to become a better writer thinker and human her expectations are incredibly high and getting an a is a challenge so get ready to read and write but the work is well worth it
2971,Brandie  Siegfried,hardest grader in the byu english department and you have to get a to get an a basically means that getting an a is impossible though a is achievable for the work of an in a different english class learned a ton but worked a ton for it as well dont regret taking the class but probably wouldnt take again
2972,Brandie  Siegfried,brandie has the highest expectations of any prof had at byu she makes you earn every single point on tests papers and participation getting an a from her is a real challenge but the best prof had i learned so much from her and will take every class i can from her in the future if you really care about your edu take brandie
2973,Brandie  Siegfried,prof siegfried teaches her subject so well and in such depth you actually learn truths about life and not just forgettable test garbage she will invest in you prof siegfried has written me quality letters of recommendation first job law school app and after dont be afraid of getting a and learning from the best english prof at byu
2974,Brandie  Siegfried,take this class if you care about your grades i got high on everything including second test and the final except for a b on the first test and a on one paper and i got a b in the class you are required to comment multiple times each period have to keep a time consuming journal this class is absolutely not worth the effort
2975,Brandie  Siegfried,professor siegfried believes that her students are capable and intelligent so she pushes your limits more than any professor ever had however the work is worth it taking two classes from professor siegfried shakespeare and film and feminist literary theory have challenged and changed my world view every ounce of work is worth it
2976,Brandie  Siegfried,brandie is one of the best professors at byu she makes you work for it but you cannot help but be completely engaged in her class and come away totally psyched about what you learned she is a hard grader with a lot of assignments but if not lazy taking her class will be one of the best academic experiences ever have
2977,Brandie  Siegfried,take this class unless already obsessed with shakespeare or a glutton for punishment dr siegfried is kind and brilliant but the course load is ridiculous the midterm takehome takes hours the reading is very heavy and she expects heavy annotation for each reading assignment
2978,Brandie  Siegfried,dr siegfried is the bomb her class goes beyond the text still using principles she taught me a year later and i always will a load of work but worth it read listen participate and get a good grade
2979,Brandie  Siegfried,this was by far one of the most incredible classes i took at byu dr siegfried is brilliant and a little bit strange but she had a way of evoking such great thinking from us during discussions and in papers fascinating teacher and very helpful when it came to our capstone paper
2980,Brandie  Siegfried,this was by the far the hardest class taken at byu expectations are extremely high but i learned so much and am grateful i had her as a teacher because every other class will probably seem extremely simple compared to hers a lot of work reading writing but she really knows her stuff and helps you whenever you need it
2981,Brandie  Siegfried,best senior course out there there is a lot required of you reading watching films etc but none of it is wasted time the midterm and final projects are difficult but nothing you expect she is open and willing to help you with your writing and become a better writer from taking her class amazing professor beautiful class
2982,Brandie  Siegfried,i took dr class duing my junior year a year senior now getting ready to graduate and i can say that she has been the most influential professor i have had at byu the principles she taught stuck even if or especially because i had to work for them
2983,Brandie  Siegfried,i took a class from professor siegfriend about a year ago and i still find myself thinking about the thinks she taught us she has high expectations graduating soon and realizing that she was probably one of the most influential professors had changed the way i look at the world highly recommended
2984,Brandie  Siegfried,this class was so awesome if trying to decide between professors i would definitely choose her she made us work hard but she believed in our ability so i never felt like it was impossible her lectures were inspiring and i always learned something really cool about her class is the applications it has to other areas of life
2985,Brandie  Siegfried,such a great class her class lectures totally blew my mind and i learned tons of useful analytical techniques that i applied to other classes i especially appreciated the time professor siegfried took to conference with every student in regards to how to improve their writing highly recommend
2986,Brandie  Siegfried,she is so amazing she really pushed everyone to think and act like scholars and not just students she is way encouraging and super friendly this class was the highlight of my educational career i could write novels about how much i like prof siegfried
2987,Brandie  Siegfried,i remember reading all the postings before the semester started and promised myself i would not let her scare me off after the day what everyone is saying is right she is the best professor at byu never been pushed this hard academically i usually average low high i just got a b on the midterm if i can do it anyone can
2988,Brandie  Siegfried,insanely hard professor i tried to meet with her about certain aspects of my grade and she seemed extremely hard to get in contact with as well as unresponsive to emails and inquiries i would not recommend her if you care about your grades at all
2989,Brandie  Siegfried,a very hard professor and she expects a lot out of you the amount of reading is rather obnoxious and she expects that reach a whole new level of learning just from being in her class sometimes funny and she seems nice but i think she expects far too much for a survey class
2990,Klaas  Kraay,great lectures and articulates the concepts very well course materials are very well organized he provides slides that are fillintheblank so you pay attention and not hard to with this teacher he also records his lectures along with the slides which is a big bonus
2991,Klaas  Kraay,kraay was great lectures were amazing and he used so many examples if you understand the concepts if you go to lecture then you do well i use the textbook much but it would have helped good class
2992,Klaas  Kraay,the course itself is really hard but if anyone was to teach it right him clear taught this course for a while because he is so good at explaining concepts that are really tough it takes time to understand but he makes it a lot easier and cares about his students get the textbook its worth it
2993,Klaas  Kraay,the lectures were clear concise and they made sense prof kraay was well spoken and always knew what he was talking about he could answer any question the students asked him about the material
2994,Klaas  Kraay,i freakin love this man best professor i have ever had his lectures are so clear and concise he knows exactly how to speak so that everyone paying attention really understands he also records his lectures and posts them so that students who miss class can easily catch up his tests are very fair and true to the content i loved him and his work
2995,Klaas  Kraay,such an easy course if your at least somewhat smart
2996,Klaas  Kraay,tests are way too hard for a first year mandatory class almost failing by second quiz so unnecessary to make this course so hard ya he cares but doesnt make it easy so whats the point
2997,Klaas  Kraay,pretty easy as long as u have him just write what he emphasizes in class and you are golden dont ever try to write in ur own words just write down to highest degree what he says in class and lecture notes
2998,Klaas  Kraay,nice guy and cares about his students but really tough course for first year and really hard tests ridiculously hard must go to class
2999,Klaas  Kraay,exams are based on things discussed in lecture so you need to go to class papers are graded exceptionally tough he bell curve but the average always tended around a c even if you make the improvements based on his comments it mean get a better grade because of how subjectively he marks
3000,Klaas  Kraay,this class is an easy a kraay makes the content easy to grasp with tons of examples and his lectures are great would take his course again
3001,Klaas  Kraay,klaas is a great prof i highly recommend if you have to take ssh105 make sure your prof you can tell he really cares about his students i have nothing but respect for the guy make sure you attend lectures and do textbook exercises emphasis on textbook exercises a pretty fair marker and will let you know exactly what he wants
3002,Klaas  Kraay,amazing prof one of the best i have had in a long time tries to connect everything to the students and encourages discussions in class really need the textbook because he posts all the topics in his ppt slides which is great readings are dry but if you go to the lectures you have to do the readings which is great
3003,Klaas  Kraay,kraay is an amazing lecturer phl110 was a really interesting course i actually learned something from him however you really cannot skip class he post full ppts and he is a very tough grader even with my interest in the course i found it really hard to balance such a demanding elective
3004,Klaas  Kraay,if you go to class you wont pass at all you cannot miss one class he leaves blanks in his powerpoints and you are only able to find the answers in class at the end of the class he does not repost the powerpoints with the missing words so you are unable to study off of them if you miss a class and there is no textbook to look at dont
3005,Klaas  Kraay,i was nervous because many reviews i read said the course gets difficult i find that it was difficult at all and not really a student that keeps up with work i never even opened my textbook and i always left class minutes early for my next one across campus you can tell he enjoys the topic and care about his students
3006,Klaas  Kraay,this class probably gave me the most anxiety i was literally shaking before each evaluation this class is composed of quizzes final is prof kraay is definitely one of the best profs at ryerson my anxiety probably had to do with the fact that i was a year student at that time but it also did not help having the lecture friday evenings
3007,Klaas  Kraay,amazing prof take ssh with him and golden
3008,Klaas  Kraay,a great prof and person overall tests are always reasonable and to the point lectures were always interesting and he even uploads the audio of his lectures which is a great help to auditory listeners
3009,Klaas  Kraay,klaas was a great prof critical thinking is an incredibly boring and slow course but you could tell he was passionate about it and really knew the material well pretty sure he played a role in writing the curriculum he posts the audio and powerpoint slides for every lecture on d2l so you have to go to class overall a great class
3010,Shahinda  Hafeez,profesor hafeez is an okay math professor she knows the material pretty well the only reason you need to attend class is because of the poppers if you get something you can always ask her questions
3011,Shahinda  Hafeez,not a very good teacher lectures are long and you walk away learning nothing take her i respect her origins but she has a heavy accent and quite hard to understand her sometimes also she is bad at math makes many mistakes and often confuses the entire class stay away from her if taking her in a big lecture
3012,Shahinda  Hafeez,i am currently in online with professor hafeez the class layout is very clear email response was ok at times response were short unclear more importantly this was an easy a if you do the homework take every quiz and remember the poppers there are several opportunities to do well i have never been a math person and i did very well
3013,Shahinda  Hafeez,her class was an easy a the only thing you really need to do is just study her test and good she sometimes messes up but overall a great professor
3014,Shahinda  Hafeez,took this class for winter mini i recommend her in terms of her notes since her notes are disorganize and lectures are pointless to attend if you plan on taking mini be prepare to work hard since this class test is like the practice exam so do it try your best to do well on the first exams since exams get harder there was no final
3015,Shahinda  Hafeez,this online class has lectures twice a week there are pop quizzes poppers in every lecture practice exams mimic the real exams and your grade on the practice gives you extra credit toward the exams you have attempts to get on your quizzes and practice exams you have the option to opt out of the final if you maintain a b or above
3016,Shahinda  Hafeez,this course is very heavy on online hw and quizzes there is four exams and the reviews tend to be helpful
3017,Shahinda  Hafeez,i am not good at math and she made it very easy to understand i took this class online and her lectures are posted if you cant log on when shes on there is homework quizzes and poppers due every week but relatively easy if you follow along exams are taken at casa and easy as long as you study and do your work for the class
3018,Shahinda  Hafeez,she can be a mess her online lectures are everywhere sometimes she forgets to record half the time and if not watching it live then good luck but the material was easy stuff you learned in high school so it a problem
3019,Shahinda  Hafeez,there is a slight communication barrier with her speech which is manageable but her email etiquette is not very good she read your questions fully and answers only half of your questions if she even responds her lectures can be confusing because she gets lost her syllabus was very unorganized including the calendar
3020,Shahinda  Hafeez,she makes a lot of mistakes when she does problems on the board so you have to correct her a lot it is also difficult to understand her the good thing is she does the math problems then posts them on her website so you can look over them later quizzes due every days even on saturdays and homework due every week poppers are a big thing
3021,Shahinda  Hafeez,this class is really what you put into it the homework really helped if you at least try to do it before going to class it was a usual math class she would solve math problems with everyone and she will answer any question we had the class can be easy if you really do the homework
3022,Shahinda  Hafeez,ms hafeez a bad professor but not going to spoon feed you if good in math and have good study habits i would say take her if not best to take someone else she goes pretty fast so it can be hard to understand going on i passed with an a but i studied my butt off her reviews help a ton for tests
3023,Shahinda  Hafeez,she tends to be unorganized messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we as the students try to correct her it was to the point where i actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me all in all i got an a by selfstudy and teaching
3024,Shahinda  Hafeez,took this class as winter mini lectures were all over the place which made it difficult to follow overall do not take her an online class
3025,Shahinda  Hafeez,currently in her class and so easy just pay attention to her notes do the practice tests poppers and quizzes and you should be of your grade from your practice test is added to the exam grade also if happy with your grade after the exams you have to take the final she is very sassy and sarcastic but i find it funny
3026,Shahinda  Hafeez,ms hafeez seemed illprepared for class and normally just winged her teaching still as long as you do the homework quizzes and inclass poppers dailywork that she uses to check attendance than be fine this class is easy to pass as long as you do the necessary work
3027,Shahinda  Hafeez,this is a review for her winter mini sesh stats first of all very engaging in her live lectures she cares a lot about her students often offering to meet us at uh to help since this course is only a month long reasonable that she goes at fast pace so pay attention or self study a little tests quizzes and poppers
3028,Shahinda  Hafeez,hafeez is extremely sarcastic and a bit stubborn but overall a good teacher and is willing to answer any questions you may have poppers every class session but are easy homework and emcf due every week tests and an optional final to replace lowest test grade
3029,Shahinda  Hafeez,i took her course online and although i like the online aspect i truly loved her teaching she is very funny and caring of her students she will stay after class hours and help those who need it i selected lecture heavy because all online so it is lol watch her lectures do her work the test will be very easy an a is possible
3030,Camilla  Griggers,took women and creativity and feminist philosophy with camilla the concepts that are taught are very abstract and i would recommend waiting until jr or sr year to take her classes
3031,Camilla  Griggers,i took camilla twice i loved her the first class was women and creativity there was a lot of reading group presentations and stuff but if your intrested in womens studies its worth it i bought some of the books and read majority of the information payed attention in clas and got an a b
3032,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy was a great professor read many negative reviews about him but those must have been the students who were expecting hand outs and did not show for class dr hardy is fair you must comply when he tells you to show up for class and turn in assignments on time he helped with test prep and gave extra credit he was awesome say
3033,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy is extremely rude he will laugh in your face about questions you ask at one point he told me he wasnt talking to me anymore also he is not willing to work with you when you have a issue our online system calculates grades wrong i received a d but if you calculate it it adds up to a b he still fix it saying it his issue
3034,Larry  Hardy,understood him since day this was one of the hardest things ever done he explain the problem or how to do it just writes it straight out of the book and expects you to know it hope this helps you decide to not take this class
3035,Larry  Hardy,very helpful and wants you to succeed bring your text book and a calculator come to class do not be late study study study you will pass his class and the compass if your listen and do what he tells you to do dr hardy wants you to pass and he is there for you thanks to mr hardy i am out of math and well on my way
3036,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy is a wonderful teacher that knows what he is talking about a math wiz come to class be on time he seems tough but he is preparing you for the compass exit exam and wants you to understand the material he is very helpful come prepared bring your book and listen in class i passed math compass exit exam thank you dr hardy
3037,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy has been the worse math teacher i have ever does not explain the information well at all if you wanna actually pass this course do not take him he has no remorse for any student although unless your black he also does not explain th infomation well at all along to go with that he tends to mumble
3038,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy expects you to listen and pay attention in his class at all times he offers extra credit and sometimes give you take home test yay he really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do so up to the student what grade he or she will make
3039,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy expects you to listen and pay attention in his class at all times he offers extra credit and sometimes give you take home test yay he really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do so up to the student what grade he or she will make
3040,Larry  Hardy,this class is not for beginners or for those of you returning to school.you need to have a very good understanding of algebra to take his classes his classes are very hard if you have no understanding or are new to algebra and you must come everyday or you will fall behind.he does give chances for extra credit sometimes.do not take his class
3041,Larry  Hardy,hardy always came to class late sometime even over minutes he was always poorly prepared and we rarely covered things on the test glad i am good at math and already knew the stuff he was trying to teach because if not i would have been screwed i only needed the class for the credit
3042,Larry  Hardy,i got on all assignments and ended up with a c in the class.he will not change a grade even when wrong attendance is mandatory i thought the class was extremely easy even if you work everything in on time or never miss a class he use that in your favor the final had things we never learned or talked about in class
3043,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy is horrible at teaching he need to improve in his teaching skills attending class everyday is a must or you will be left behind he will give you extra credit to help your grade sorta fair when he feels like it go to the tutoring lab because they will help you i recommend his class to people who have a hard time in math
3044,Larry  Hardy,i really stuggle at math and he made me even more aware of the fact that i have a hard time i cried everyday that i was in that class because he was so hard and i could never understand what he was teaching he does not explain the material well at all i had to withdraw it was a horrible experience
3045,Larry  Hardy,i agree with the other comment that he for the faint of heart i was ready to drop the day but i found him to be fair have a sense of humor give many opportunities to improve your grade need support from the lab since very short on explanations but in the end i enjoyed being in his class passed the compass made an a
3046,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy is the worst teacher i have ever had my entire life i recommend him to my enemy i went to his office to ask him for help and he laughed in my faced i had a math class in years and he was not willing to help the slightest bit i withdrew so i fail
3047,Larry  Hardy,dr.hardy is the most incompetent teacher i have ever had the displeasure of knowing had i not known math before i started his class i would be failing he is very rude and is completely disinterested in his students if you black he doesnt care about you so if you are going to take his class white people you better get a tan
3048,Larry  Hardy,he is the worst teacher possible no matter what you do you can please him he will not help and if you ask questions he talks to you like your dumb when he grades he does not make sense and when he teaches its like reading off a teleprompter i have never seen him be nice or fai
3049,Larry  Hardy,dr.hardy is a very fair teacher you must do your never know when it might count as your test math was never easy for me but i made an a in his class you will need to go to the study lab but it pays off
3050,Larry  Hardy,dr hardy is not for the faintatheart immature or lazy he expects you to catch on quickly and is not going to baby anyone if you do the work you should pass also not very helpful so be ready to spend time in the tutoring lab
3051,Larry  Hardy,most days he is minutes late to class then he sits down and reads off a powerpoint pay attention and take notes because this is a class where you do have to teach yourself most of it it uncommon for him to laugh at your questions and simply tell you easy and he already showed how even so class is passable with effort
3052,Beth  Hilburn,oh my god i made a c on with shelton and an a in her class she got me interested in history awsome teacher the best too bad she will no longer teach at san jac srping08 was her last sem to teach
3053,Beth  Hilburn,she was a great teacher i took her in a mini over christmas break she was good i would suggest her to anyone
3054,Beth  Hilburn,a great teacher print out notes from a website and you fill in the blank in class teaches off overhead tests and assignments not a hard class at all not a history person but i enjoyed it
3055,Beth  Hilburn,very nice teacher her class is easy sit there and dont even have to take you will pass quizzes are extremely easy as well i would take her for all my other classes as well if i could

3064,Beth  Hilburn,hilburn was really nice easy and simple everything is spoonfed elementary knowledge i hate history and have therefore never retained anything from a history course till now
3065,Beth  Hilburn,reviews at the beginning of each class multiple choice tests easy paper no book required print notes off of a website easy to get a hold of amazing and funny woman would definitly recommend her if you make it in this hist class then wow beth
3066,Beth  Hilburn,great teacher and she makes history extremely interesting everyone in the class really liked her
3067,Beth  Hilburn,i highly recommend taking history with ms hilburn she makes learning history fun and interesting even if you like history she is very nice and funny during lecture and the tests are multiple choice what more could you want i wish i had taken her for as well
3068,Beth  Hilburn,this was a fun and interesting class
3069,Beth  Hilburn,she is awesome i love history and she makes it all the more fun to learn no book needed time saver
3070,Beth  Hilburn,i love her so cool took her makes history very interesting all round if your not good in history take her you will love it save money because you need a book print notes off bb and go to class and fill in the blanks tests quizzes are straight off the notes going to miss you ms.hilburn
3071,Beth  Hilburn,wow class is soo easy if you want an a take her no book needed she does reviws class b4 test which are basically the answers mult chice no essays taking as summer class now
3072,Brian  George,very nice guy he comes off very quiet at first but he really does love his students you do have to try he will push you for assignments and projects but only because he wants to see everyone do their best
3073,Brian  George,dr george is an excellent professor if you do the work and go to class you will do fine he is also very willing to help any students who ask
3074,Brian  George,goes really fast and acts like you already know everything about fabric usually tests are hard he even told us before the first test that half of us would drop and he laughed also verry boring
3075,Brian  George,george is a pretty good teacher gives a quiz one day a week and its only questions there are tests make sure you study the class is a joke if you study and take notes power point every day he goes kinda fast so i suggest using a computer for notes he isnt really into teaching this class hes engineering so hes pretty lenient
3076,Brian  George,hes a great teacher he gives alot of information just pass his tests and quizes and do great in his class you dont need to buy the txt book
3077,Brian  George,he really gets down to buisness class always got out a few minutes early and he always got everything in hes very helpful if you need help just go to him the only thing that can be a downside is he went very fast but if you ever missed something in the notes he was willing to give it to you after take all the notes and you have no problems
3078,Brian  George,gives a lott of notes on the board and projector take good notes because the tests are kinda hard and you need all that information to answer the specific questions on the test doesnt really give hw
3079,Brian  George,does he know his stuff i dont think so ask him a question and he does not know about it just keeps giving stupid assignments and thinks he is doing a great job if you want to learn something forget ths man if u just want to pass take him
3080,Brian  George,what a fungi
3081,Brian  George,no comments
3082,Brian  George,easy class makes the class interesting i would recommend taking him
3083,Brian  George,prof george gives hard tests a lot of the time asking specific questions he is very knowledgable about the subject and even though he doesnt take attendance showing up on days when everyone else doesnt results in bonus points on exams which are needed
3084,Brian  George,he expects a lot from students but if you go to class he is very helpful
3085,Brian  George,he goes really fast but you learn alot
3086,Philip  Burge,he is an awful teacher cancelled class so many times in the semester with short notice without approving it through the department assigns essays which are very subjective and unclear grading recommend him
3087,Philip  Burge,this class was just him trying to prove to the students that he was a good parent he is very arrogant and self consumed he provided no help and did not even bother to learn our names he also cancelled class way to many times and we probably did not cover half of the material we were supposed to if you want to learn do not take him
3088,Philip  Burge,he cancled class too often and the material half was intropsyc and the other half was his life story this teacher is concieted and self righteous rarely alowing students to explain themselves when a question is asked instead he opts to hear himself speak easy enough if you can memorize and regurgitate take if you actualy want to learn
3089,Philip  Burge,he is ok page essays exams exams are a bit tricky but not impossible if you study he canceled class a total of times nice guy he is alright
3090,Philip  Burge,professor burge absolutely knows his stuff he is passionate about child development and mentions his grandson and basketball team every class only take exam and the final or bb assignments and observations of kids under i would definitely take him again
3091,Philip  Burge,professor burge is one of the nicest and most interesting teachers that had so far at towson he is extremely interesting and his class is a piece of cake you do have to study for his tests and memorize quite a bit for the essays but other than that worth taking his class if i had the chance i would take another one of his classes
3092,Philip  Burge,tu is lucky to have him as a prof one of the best teachers that ever had very entertaining and straight forward gives great examples about what he is lecturing on take good notes review them before the exams no text needed wait to take him again
3093,Philip  Burge,such a good professor his tests are straight from the notes and he pretty much tells you whats going to be on them makes class very interesting because he talks about his experiences as opposed to lecturing from notes highly recommend and buy the book
3094,Philip  Burge,really enjoyed this class do not buy text all info provided in notes and exams are from his notes he has very interesting examples from his experience pay ateention study notes you will do well i looked forward to this class and am taking a class with him next semester because of this sometimes he comes off a little sharp but he is nice
3095,Philip  Burge,very nice guy laid back and makes class interesting he knows what hes talking about and very knowledgeable doesnt require the use of a textbook tests are straightforward page paper on a disability you take on for a day would definately recommend to others
3096,Philip  Burge,very nice guy laid back and makes class interesting he knows what hes talking about and very knowledgeable doesnt require the use of a textbook tests are straightforward page paper on a disability you take on for a day would definately recommend to others
3097,Philip  Burge,amazing teacher knows his material very entertaining makes going to class fun would take him a million times more no textbook and is very straight forward about the exams
3098,Philip  Burge,professor burge was a good teacher and makes it clear what is going to be on each test there are a few out of class assignments that take a lot of effort to complete make sure you work hard in this class because professor burge has very high standards
3099,Philip  Burge,great class with lots of discussion there is no textbook prof is funny and has tons of experience in the field would highly recommend this class no exams but lots of papers to write
3100,Philip  Burge,pretty laid back class no use of textbook and we pretty much ran through test material because we got off topic so much always got out min early and always told us what would be on the test mult choice and lots of short answers also there are observation papers that he grades harder than you would expect interesting guy
3101,Philip  Burge,burge is the man loved taking this class with him there is no assigned textbook for this class so all material is straight from lectures has a tendency to wonder at times during discussions but overall very pleased two exams two observation papers one final project his expectations can be somewhat vague but great guy overall take him
3102,Philip  Burge,fun teacher lots of discussion no reading definitely knows the subject well as he has had a lot of jobs in the field
3103,Philip  Burge,class was okay i guess if you like a class with stated guidelines do not take i was often unclear about what he expected from me on the work because he never stated what he wanted exactly but if you do bad on the work he does let you do it over again test are easy if you study lots of stories about his son he is over all a nice man
3104,Philip  Burge,he is extremely in to teaching and has a very good way of getting points across however you really need to study for his tests not necessarily the multiple choice but the essays he is very down to earth and funny but expect an a unless you put forth some effort get ready to hear funny stories mostly about his son great guy
3105,Philip  Burge,buy the book he never uses it if you like listening about his son great because all you are going to do it was an easy class but i care for him because all he talks about is himself and not on the test an easy class though
3106,Jeffrey  Nielsen,some instructors insist their students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts like dates or names good instructors make sure that the ideas seep in and focus on useless details jeffrey is a good instructor i feel like i genuinely learned and i feel like my perspective on ethics have made a change for the better after finishing his class
3107,Jeffrey  Nielsen,like they say easy class but what i liked most was the fact that he pushed us to be better people and actually apply what we learned into our life take if you want a challenge but take if you want to be a better person
3108,Jeffrey  Nielsen,prof nielsen while a good person did not teach well we hardly learned anything in class he seemed to not care about the class or what he taught it was not challenging at all despite the fact that it was an honors course i recommend him if you want an easy a but not if you want education
3109,Jeffrey  Nielsen,prof nielson is way awesome his class is easy and always willing to help you so lenient when it comes to grades and when you turn things in awesome
3110,Jeffrey  Nielsen,great class it was easy but i learned a ton
3111,Jeffrey  Nielsen,class was great assingments too hard and had very clear due dates the class atmosphere was laid back knowledge of the subject is pretty vast and he makes it easy for one to learn a lot
3112,Jeffrey  Nielsen,no comments
3113,Jeffrey  Nielsen,class is too easy but i guess why its nielsen is a good professor seems very widely read and educated and was fascinating to discuss serious questions with
3114,Richard  Fallon,incredible professor and human being if you get a chance to take a class of his while at the college do it you regret it
3115,Richard  Fallon,this class was real easy the guys knows what he is talking about
3116,Richard  Fallon,makes an impossibly difficult subject at least mildly comprehensible moves very fast so be careful assigns more reading than necessary but lectures very clearly a nice guy grill you in class the class would be great if we have to move so fast should really be a class
3117,Richard  Fallon,brilliant and open to nontraditional approaches fiction plays whatever to the third year paper
3118,Richard  Fallon,turned me off law school
3119,Richard  Fallon,one of the best at hls it is con law so it easy but he does a great job of explaining difficult and complex topics not the most famous con law prof at hls but far more engaged in teaching than tribe take this for a solid base then tribe for advanced con law
3120,Richard  Fallon,clarifies a lot of tough law but the class is still hard
3121,Richard  Fallon,awfully dodgy character if you ask me i never like his guess what thinking tests especially the essays really understand the usefulness of the tennis quizzes either i guess i have a lot to learn
3122,Richard  Fallon,
3123,Donna  Woolard,all her test are online stress they can be taken more than once
3124,Donna  Woolard,great professor every test is online and you can take them unlimited times only essay for this class very easy class
3125,Donna  Woolard,i absolutely love dr woolard a kind soul and she genuinely cares about her students and wants to help them succeed the class is not difficult though i did experience some technical difficulties with my computer which she was always willing to work through with me she believe in making a subject harder than it needs to be
3126,Donna  Woolard,awesome class with awesome professor will use these skills for the rest of my life thouroughly enjoyed this class with woolard
3127,Donna  Woolard,this class is very easy i recommend taking it during the summer sessions if you want to avoid the boring lectures i took it during the summer and we didnt have to attend class very often just did the the online tests and worksheets which are very book based ask very personal health ace this class no problem as i did
3128,Donna  Woolard,literally made me into the person i am today would not be where i am without her
3129,Donna  Woolard,awsome teacher and her class is a complete waste of time as far as learning is concerned but she could tell you eveerything you need to build your schedule and complete your major and is just very passionate about sports i recommend her highly
3130,Donna  Woolard,fun loving teacher great job
3131,Donna  Woolard,easiest class taken but also the biggest waste of time learn anything we met most days and just watched her search on google she was not prepared she has an open door policy so she will always help you good at giving advice but bad teacher
3132,Donna  Woolard,easy class but she gets off subject bad she spends most of the time taking about what to do if your going to be a teacher which has nothing to do with the class all the test are online but you have to look up every question because she goes over none of it in class
3133,Donna  Woolard,easy easy easy tests are online and you can retake them as many times as you need if you need an elective take this class
3134,Donna  Woolard,love love love her the only professor at campbell that has never shut me down when i have ask for help she is very helpful and inspiring wish she taught more classes
3135,Donna  Woolard,she is extremely easy she cancelled class at least times in one semester because she had other obligations all quizzes are online even have to buy the book because the labs are online
3136,Donna  Woolard,very best professor dr woolard is a true college professor and she really cares about your grade and you
3137,Donna  Woolard,best teacher at campbell truly cares
3138,Donna  Woolard,doc is the best campbell has to offer so down to earth an easy take her you want regret it
3139,Donna  Woolard,the best at campbell
3140,Donna  Woolard,man if u dont like this teacher you like no one incredubliy easy and an so down to earth take her
3141,Donna  Woolard,doc is the best teacher anyone could ask for she rocks she is willing to do anything to help you and such a nice person if you make less then an a in any of her classes you need to drop out of school you dont need to be here
3142,Donna  Woolard,dr woolard is a good is more than fair she goes out of her way to help the student she will help your gpa i have never made less than an a in any of her classes
3143,Phil  Matheson,i practically have to do the entire lab before class if i want to finish but he gives full credit regardless of how much you turn in quizzes are difficult
3144,Phil  Matheson,it was a lab class so mostly homework done in class he was very good at explaining the information though and was willing to help you as long as you tick him off with stupid questions be respectful and inquisitive and do fine
3145,Phil  Matheson,his assignments are easy go to class and listen you can sleep if you like review his lectures not posted online never follows schedule tests are impossible literally but he curves test like none other for example a on one test was an a so just study at the last minute for the tests and beat your classmates
3146,Phil  Matheson,i first took this class with robert ridge both professors are good and give good demonstrations but matheson did more demonstrations and his slides had more images as a visual learner that was very valuable to me i understood much more in his class tests are in class i recommend him to students who are single parents due to his flexibility
3147,Phil  Matheson,he may be smart and know his stuff but he is a horrible professor and i love physics he constantly talks down to the class and acts like he is revolutionizing your world view or like you have never thought about the universe before he rushes over formulas and never does them with you he just shows a slide of how he did them
3148,Phil  Matheson,one of the best ever had matheson is the bomb and very considerate of the students teaching take some time over weekends to watch physics movies online grabbing the conceptual picture will help tons
3149,Phil  Matheson,extremely unorganized lectures nearly impossible to take notes from rarely has a physics demo actually work
3150,Phil  Matheson,he expects a lot from his student you will need to work however he will help you if needed he usually grades on a curve and a very kind one at that friendly and will gladly have a chat about physics and how it works especially if it helps your understanding in the class
3151,Phil  Matheson,professor matheson is a very smart and nice guy he is more than willing to explain any question you have until you understand the concept he gives difficult homework and test but grades it very graciously if you do the work you will get an a in his class
3152,Phil  Matheson,professor matheson is an extremely nice man but makes no sense whatsoever because his lectures were so hard to follow most of the class was left reading the textbook going to the physics lab and studying in large groups for hours upon hours
3153,Phil  Matheson,adorably dorky but not a great teacher what he teaches in class you understand but his assignments which make most of your grade you understand if you must take this class from him be sure to come together as a class and start a study group only way i have survived the semester
3154,Phil  Matheson,easy going nice guy but class was really boring he lectures the whole time and its hard to stay interested plus the subject is very difficult lots of homework reading and test reccomend for a general requirement class
3155,Phil  Matheson,fairly easy and grades on a curve a pretty mellow and nice guy even though you to go to class much i think it helps because he does a good job at explaining concepts in the book
3156,Phil  Matheson,there are quizzes every other day and assignments every other week the questions are ridiculous he asks things that make any sense this class is boring however he lets you take the tests in class and lets you talk to students in the class avoid this class at all costs i learn anything
3157,Phil  Matheson,a nice man that knows what it is that he is teaching i understand the class at all but it is enjoyable at times the textbook explain things well although we use it a lot an expensive class maybe not a first choice class
3158,Phil  Matheson,he is a great teacher cool thing was is he has actually been out in the feild before teaching you will learn a lot if you come with the right attitude i am not interested in astronomy but he is so it makes it more interesting take him if you fall asleep easy i like his class but go to class and he like people who ask questions
3159,Phil  Matheson,awesome teacherone of the best he actually has a degree in physicsunlike some other physics teachers at uvhigh uvsc he explaines things very clearly i would highly recommend him
3160,Phil  Matheson,i found him very confusing the text book is huge and he explain the concepts very well if you can avoid him do
3161,Phil  Matheson,he very clear as a teacher and his tests are hard but he is very helpful he is very generous grading as well he fail anybody that tries
3162,Phil  Matheson,he is a great professor i have learned so much in his class he makes class fun and very interesting he shows how physics applies in our life he is very knowledgeable about the subject and i would highly recommend him as a physics teacher
3163,Susan  Murray,prof murray is very knowledgable and her lectures are really interesting heavier on readings but as long as you read them before the tests be fine very fair grading
3164,Susan  Murray,knowledgeable professor the material lends itself to dryness because much of it is a repeat of material studied in several other mcc classes not a demanding course if you stay on top of the materials and screenings i enjoyed the class her structuring of the class and her dry wit
3165,Susan  Murray,i took television history and form with professor murray this semester she is a good professor very clear a bit boring at times but overall a good class grading is done in a very straight forward manner and if you go to class and do most of the you will get a good grade
3166,Susan  Murray,she is a very fair grader and all assignments are fair she is also very nice and helpful it was her first time teaching amateur media she knew a lot but often her knowledge was around photography the class was kind of boring and the articles and lectures were often common sense or dull the class was more history based then i thought
3167,Susan  Murray,one of the best had at nyu
3168,Susan  Murray,i thought this would be an fun class but quite a hard ass tons of reading i thought the focus would be more on the cultural impact but all technical and about rules and regulations of tv i kind of hate this class
3169,Susan  Murray,great teacher a fun subject and she is organized and clear about what she requires the midterm and final are extremely straightforward just do the readings at some point the research paper is work but the fact the subject matter is interesting so it goes by fast i would definitely recommend this professor and class
3170,Susan  Murray,very nice and she knows what talking about make sure to take good notes bc the tests rele come from paying attention to what she says in class a lot of rdgs pretty lecture based but with very fun enjoyable tv clips cool
3171,Susan  Murray,awesome very knowledgeable has a clear plan of where she wants to go with the class concentrates a lot on radio in the beginning so expect a lot of historical readings very good about answering questions and clarifying when you are confused highly recommended
3172,Susan  Murray,
3173,Susan  Murray,very interesting professor very nice helpful willing to work with you available to students not a difficult professor fair normal work load
3174,Susan  Murray,really really easy nice
3175,Susan  Murray,no comments
3176,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,show up review a bit pass that easy with such a brilliant professor as bvb no reading required just a cd that is optional if you need help reviewing before the tests a visual analysis paper that should not be an issue if you spend some time on it there might be a lot of material to memorize but bvb curves a lot
3177,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,one of the best professors had she not only wants you to pass but actually do well she allows you extra credit if she sees you put in effort her lectures are very interesting she is extremely it is so different from your other classes just by content very refreshing you will need the cd which is a bit expensive
3178,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,my favorite art history professor super sweet is a practical professor she make you remember dates which is awesome if you know art history classes clear on her requirements and always accessible
3179,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,professor von barghahncalvetti or as she prefers is easy to like because she clearly enjoys her work lectures are extremely wellresearched if looking for an easy a with little work go elsewhere she expects a lot of research for papers presentations still she is always available for feedback is generous with grading
3180,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,for the sake of your sanity do not take this class unless you have a painful passion for memorizing paintings and their artists for inclass exams extra credit is generous but staying awake in lectures is grueling as a finance major there was nothing interesting about the class and i recommend it for analytical people
3181,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,i have trouble understanding why all of the other reviews are so positive she was an easy grader but we had to do excessive research for oral presentations also she made many political comments that were unrelated to the course regarding feminism the aca the iraqi war etc her comments were unprofessional at best do not recommend
3182,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,bvb is the best absolutely lifechanging and one of the leading experts in her field so so brilliant such a wonderful person who truly wants her students to do well is willing to go above beyond to help tests are hard so you need to put in the work and skip class textbook is usually a cd of images that you will use
3183,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,bvb is great really passionate about her field and her knowledge and research is impressive she wants you to be as passionate about the information as she is clear about assignments and will gladly clarify that being said there is so much information to memorize for exams and her tests cover a lot of material
3184,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,bvb is one of the best professors at gw she has a love for renaissance art which is infectious her lectures are fascinating and clear and she is a pretty easy grader she really cares about her students so it pays to get to know her i have taken many classes with her and hope to take more she is everything a student could ask for
3185,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,very long winded lectures seemed angry when asked questions claimed tests would not be too hard but required absurd amounts of information memorized
3186,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,great engaging professor but the only reference for the class is a cd that only works on pcs which is really annoying
3187,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,the one bad part is an expensive cd but we could drop of quizzes bring in a few pictures of work into the tests email for notes if we miss class and do lots of extra credit no readings and class prepares you for tests
3188,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,bvb is a lot of fun and truly understands the hard parts of being a student i make you do readings i used to hate that she has extensive knowledge though i wish she would focus a little more on the art and less on the politics and royal affairs if you take northern be ready to study many french chateaus and royal portraits
3189,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,you have to know art pieces for both the midterm and the final as a result you remember much from the course but she does give alot of extra credit and she seems to want people to enjoy the course her spanish art one course was the best because you really get to look at art from a perspective it is easy to dote on her
3190,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,bvb is a great teacher she tells you a lot of information in each lecture but she will repeat things that are likely to be on the exam take notes and remember more famous works extremely nice take her classes
3191,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,this woman is so amazing and nice very friendly and will even email you notes or extend deadlines even if your excuse is because you woke up late or are too lazy to do it on time the class however is so boring and depressing exams are easy if you study the notes and memorize the slide names and artists
3192,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,she is a very good teacher very knowledgeable about art history her lectures are very thorough and you have to able to take good notes her exams are hard but she curves and there is extra credit so its not too bad
3193,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,an amazing teacher and a great human being knows a lot of the subject matter exams are challenging but great art historians have to take al least one of her classes you will be able to keep waht you have learned for teh rest of your life great class
3194,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,wonderful she talks fast but you can always ask her questions very easy to talk to she is cute and a sweet heart you forget her take her if you are interested in art
3195,Barbara  Von Barghahn-Calvetti,i took two courses with her in the same semesteri loved it i have been more excited to wake up at am her teaching method is to tell a story sometimes making implications its like going to listen to your favorite aunt and have her show you pictures and tell you stories about them great professor fair grader
3196,Joseph  Fruscione,terrible teacher avoid
3197,Joseph  Fruscione,nice person not a nice professor
3198,Joseph  Fruscione,this was the worst professor ever had at gw seriously avoid him mean overly critical to students and just plain down rude if he like you he seriously scared me he was just that bad of a professor take another class because most likely you get an a or even a b in his class
3199,Joseph  Fruscione,this professor is hands down terrible he is condescending critical and extremely rude to your face his grading is unfair and harsh and he offers no help or extra assistance that is of any use do not take this class
3200,Joseph  Fruscione,i really enjoyed this prof he has high expectations and helps a lot too attendance is mandatory as well as participation i learned a lot in his class and have lots of respect towards his knowledge
3201,Joseph  Fruscione,igreat professor you can tell passionate about the subject and clearly expresses his expectations also very helpful with papers and assignments you really need to read the books because of the films as long as you participate in discussions and get on his good side which be hard if you go to class do fine
3202,Joseph  Fruscione,forget tough but fair not fair and his toughness is artificial if you fail to make the arguments he wants you to make in the way he wants you to make them the grade you receive will not reflect your work
3203,Joseph  Fruscione,professor fruscione was incredibly condescending he clearly picked favorites and if he like you your grade would reflect that
3204,Joseph  Fruscione,i took the shakespeare uw with this prof and a little harsh he teaches you what you need to know and i loved watching the movies he grades really strictly make sure you develop all arguments participate in class
3205,Joseph  Fruscione,great teacher not so great of a person i actually did better in this class than i thought i would attendance is mandatory you get after that your head and participation is key i would highly recommend taking a different uw if you can i really learn anything after this course either fail
3206,Joseph  Fruscione,i took the class because i thought it sounded interesting a really nice guy but grades kinda harshly you are allowed to miss classes but after that it hurts your final grade there are papers are pages is you will definitely be able to better analyze both literature and film after this class a great teacher
3207,Joseph  Fruscione,ehh
3208,Joseph  Fruscione,is a tough grader will get really snippy if tardy more than once will get snippy if you are absent more than twice will get irritable if not enough people participate during class even with all his moodiness he was very good at critiquing papers and always wanted his students to progress you have to do the work and come to class
3209,Joseph  Fruscione,okay fruscione seems like a good guy definitely not an easy or generous grader his moods seem to change frequently sometimes really friendly other times he essentially will tell you have no concept of the english language whatsoever this class was a lot of work for uw
3210,Joseph  Fruscione,class was extremely boring at some times the papers about or were a hassle but manageable easy grader
3211,Joseph  Fruscione,he is very nice and helpful always available for office hours and answers emails very quickly i really enjoyed the topic and he made the class fun he picks good and the papers that hard there are about papers total and all about pages the final paper is totally your choice on topic
3212,Joseph  Fruscione,prof fruscione is a great teacher really fun and simple class read books and watch the film adaptations and write a paper about it you can pick your own topic for the page paper at the end and always open for questions even though we can miss class i went to most of them because we always had good discussion highly recommended
3213,Joseph  Fruscione,avoid
3214,Joseph  Fruscione,this class was fairly simple and engaging for those who wanted to get something out of it the teacher is a fun guy who is sometimes a little too lenient with the less bright people in the class but having us listen to chris walken perform the raven was awesome
3215,Joseph  Fruscione,professor joe is a nice guy and is genuinely interested in his students getting something out of his class this class is all about group discussion and hios film choices are overall really good and interesting he is a fair grader who tends to give you the benefit of the doubt i would recommend this class and professor to any student
3216,Linda  Shelton,i had some health issues this semesters and she was very caring and willing to help class was a little boring mostly just grading your grammar worksheets together i almost wish it had been a little bit more challenging careful though she was a much tougher grader than i expected for the big projects
3217,Linda  Shelton,professor shelton was by far the best english professor i have ever had she works with each student personally in order for them to be as successful as possible she also has you work on one subject all semester long so all of the work you do is helping you develop your final paper she is super compassionate and loving to all
3218,Linda  Shelton,professor shelton was one of the best had my entire academic career she helps you understand the why behind the papers she gives she is very clear on her expectations and is very enthusiastic on what she teaches she uses the book pretty exclusively so google will not save you
3219,Linda  Shelton,i loved linda she was so fun even though there was a lot of homework she made it worth it because she would help you through it we did a lot of group assignments and group talking i would take her class again
3220,Linda  Shelton,she is like the little grandma that everyone wishes they had she wants her students to pass and will help them make that possible if she sees your effort she will work with you the whole semester was spent on writing the final paper by building it piece by piece funny and really helpful
3221,Linda  Shelton,linda is a fantastic english teacher she explains things clearly and openly she will be the first to tell you that the assignment is odd or might not seem worth while but she explains the why behind it she is open and honest when she gives feedback and really gives you keys to succeed
3222,Linda  Shelton,she was a good english professor there were times in her class where she loved talking about political and controversial things which too relevant to english but overall she stayed on track her grading for papers is very fair and she gives great feedback on how you can improve i would take her class again
3223,Linda  Shelton,i loved taking this class from linda she is great she was very understanding about everything i turned in a few assignments late and she mark me down for it all she really cares is that it is completed and that we did out best there are a lot of papers but she is willing to help you and accommodate
3224,Linda  Shelton,she is literally the best she wants her students to succeed and wants you to get the best grade possible in her class she does one on one conferences when it comes to midterms and your final paper and she do a finals test your last research paper is your final and you finish the class a week early definitely has been my favorite
3225,Linda  Shelton,professor shelton is not a teacher for the lazy or for the procrastinator she is willing to work with you and will talk to you about grades if you want to know why you got a certain score you will generally be writing a paper every week but as long as you keep up with homework you get bogged down
3226,Linda  Shelton,professor shelton was one of the best professors i have had she is always there for you when you need help during office hours after class and she is invested in success
3227,Linda  Shelton,linda is the kind of professor that makes you love the subject grammar is tolerable at its best but linda made it interesting and fun she is a very skilled instructor and she knows her subject matter i believe attendance is key for receiving an a but i never wanted to miss her class so this a problem
3228,Linda  Shelton,if you take this class be prepared to write a lot linda is a harsh grader with the major assignments most of the assignments were a waste of time she is not helpful and her instructions are unclear she told me i had a good topic to write about and my summaries of articles were good but then tore apart my final paper take this class
3229,Linda  Shelton,linda is awesome this is the most interesting most fun and most relevant grammar class ever taken the best part about linda is that she thinks grammar is stupid so while she is teaching it she admits it has flaws and encourages discussion about it.she brings in readings that challenge the idea of traditional grammar take this class
3230,Linda  Shelton,linda is so nice and so much fun this class really prepares you for all of your other college classes she will help you with anything and she is way funny too
3231,Linda  Shelton,took this class as a hybrid then needed to drop the class a few weeks in due to some schedule changes she is a great professor generates good discussion interesting and fun however as far as a course goes there is a lot of writing way more than other professors for several page papers due almost every week along with assignments
3232,Linda  Shelton,shes wonderful and considering i hated the subject thats saying something learning about research papers is tedious on a good day but shes fun and smart and thought provoking and i never dreaded going to class it certainly is work but never more than can be handled you may not like the subject but you walk out with skill
3233,Linda  Shelton,she is the best professor i have ever had she makes things incredibly clear and she teaches the simplicity of things without making you feel stupid she is so helpful if you understand something and she is very approachable i highly recommend this professor incredible
3234,Linda  Shelton,very unclear does not know what she actually wants your papers to be about you get to choose your topics but she is very particular grades harshly
3235,Linda  Shelton,she is awesome funny and makes class entertaining by telling jokes and stories that relate and help us understand the subject she made grammar fun not too many tests multiple choice done on a scantron and a paper or two definitely recommend taking her like a spunky young funny version of my grandma
3236,Aurora  Wallace,aurora is fantastic really cares about our projects and makes an effort to support us towards creating a fantastic final work
3237,Aurora  Wallace,aurora is a really great lecturer the class was interesting and a delved into a variety of topics regarding modern media you have to do the readings though and show up to lecture most of the material on the quiz is stuff she lectures on do all the grading as another review said overall would take her again
3238,Aurora  Wallace,great professor and amazing lecturer class consisted mainly of quizzes and papers do most of the grading
3239,Aurora  Wallace,took her for crime media violence very charismatic and interesting funny dorky jokes propel the otherwise dull lectures very hard grader really tell you what you did to write on not the best not the worst
3240,Aurora  Wallace,she was a great lecturer and engaging particularly considering it is a large lecture environment
3241,Aurora  Wallace,talks way too much about herself makes unfunny side of which have anything to do with the course which is actually despite her very interesting if you want eyecandy there are other places to look not hot not funny just not
3242,Aurora  Wallace,i had her for two classes in one semester advertising society and media history of ny definitely knows her stuff about advertising and increased my knowledge and interest in the subject but she is a tough grader
3243,Aurora  Wallace,had her for advertising and society extremely clear knows what talking about class was straight forward so there was no need to go to her to ask questions definitely need to study for but easily comprehensible material
3244,Aurora  Wallace,worst professor ever had refused to read my paper or answer my questions when i went to office hours and instead sent me to her ta absolutely thinks god and takes herself way too seriously cold hearted and only cares about herself i think she got pissed no one came to her lectures and failed everyone for the final out of spite
3245,Aurora  Wallace,awful teacher incredibly boring would teach lectures and no one would show up she would make sassy comments at people who did come very hard grader not a lot learned you can take a lot better classes than this at nyu do not do it
3246,Aurora  Wallace,definately not the best at nyu but she knows her material yet she is so nerdy and laughs so much at her own dull jokes that her class is not really what you would call fun her quick facts are cool though
3247,Aurora  Wallace,i have prof wallace for advertising and society and i love her she obviously knows a lot about the subject and has a lot of interesting educated opinions although she object to discussion she has a lot of visuals necessary for this kind of class and plus just adorable but she so give her any
3248,Aurora  Wallace,if you can take this course with someone else do so she takes herself too seriously the lectures are dry and boring
3249,Aurora  Wallace,boring class boring material monotonous lectures and cold atmosphere rather be giving blood i highly do not recommend this professor to anyone definitely take another professor even if it conflicts with your schedule be very thankful trust me
3250,Aurora  Wallace,professor wallace clearly knows what she is talking about and she always tries to make the class interesting i highly recommend her as a professor for any subject within communications
3251,Aurora  Wallace,most boring class ever if the material coma enducing enough her monotonous voice should just about do it
3252,Aurora  Wallace,aurora is the best professor nyu has to offer
3253,Aurora  Wallace,great professor great class interesting subject matter pick a good ta or the recitation is worthless but aurora does a great job on her own the people that complain are lazy
3254,Aurora  Wallace,wallace is a pretty good professor.her lectures were a bit dull esp at the material is easy enough and as long as you read most of the txt and attend most of the lectures and rct you have any trouble.the hardest part about the class was finding the motivation to actually attend
3255,Aurora  Wallace,her class is really interesting and its sucks that its early in the morning because its easy to fall asleep but her class is interesting and shes really funny her tests that difficult if you keep up with your work
3256,Ted  Magder,ted is definitely a great teacher truly intelligent and influential in the communication field sometimes name drops i had a really bad ta so it made the experience difficult however class was thought provoking and readingintensive
3257,Ted  Magder,very knowledgeable prof in mcc dpt widely covered issues and morethaninteresting lecture that makes legal issues interesting and inspiring although course work is a little bit heavy not a big deal if you can handle intro to media study well do need research and final paper
3258,Ted  Magder,really interesting class very knowledgable few quizzes no textbook simple and easy papers magder is great
3259,Ted  Magder,ted is incredibly knowledgable and wellprepared his lectures are very fast paced you need to take notes on a lot of what he says and not just rely on the powerpoints he posts on nyu classes he is not always clear but is willing to help
3260,Ted  Magder,hands down one of my favorite professors at nyu extremely accessible knowledgable and wellconnected every lecture may not always be of interest to you since multiple sectors are covered but you can tell very prepared and interested in what students have to say work was fairly demanding but manageable highly recommend
3261,Ted  Magder,ted is a great professor he is at the top of his field and has clearly refined his curriculum the class is split up into coherent well organized units and he presents the material clearly and concisely makes the broad subject engaging with pop culture references and video clips definitely take ims with magder
3262,Ted  Magder,first ignore the steve jobs comparisons black turtlenecks with black jeans are the only things the two have in common i have had him twice now and really enjoyed his business class he can be a bit selfabsorbed and loves to namedrop nevertheless great professor who cares about his students and the university highly recommended
3263,Ted  Magder,ted is a great teacher and you really learn a lot in his class his tests require a lot of studying but they too bad he gives many assignments but they are mostly interesting overall lectures were usually interesting sometimes they were quite boring
3264,Ted  Magder,i had him for business of media i learned a lot in the class but he really teach everything was mostly selftaught due to the weekly blog posts he was interesting and had cool speakers and the workload was pretty heavy a lot of writing but i do see the advantages of taking this class as it is very applicable to the real world
3265,Ted  Magder,i really enjoyed ted magder his lectures were interesting and relevant i appreciated his interest in his students opinions on current events and his humorous approach to teaching also he hardcore reminds me of steve jobs
3266,Ted  Magder,nothing against him the course material was not for me.you pick a media sector either games or music read the trades and blog then write a pg research paper this class has no critical and you hear stories about his famous friends and his soccer fanaticism.he has a soothing voice
3267,Ted  Magder,meh overrated material is interesting though
3268,Ted  Magder,great professor very interesting guy def take this class if you take good notes and skim the text book the tests too bad.explains everything well warm person
3269,Ted  Magder,intro to media studies great class lectures online take attendance but go to recitations because they do help with understanding some of the more complex articles
3270,Ted  Magder,magder is the best are far from mandatory in fact you could miss every single one and nobody would notice but helpful to attend and his lecturing is engaging the workload too much but it definitely a breeze either mc was tricky but luckily he reformatted the final quiz to only one essay
3271,Ted  Magder,attendance is not necessary going to recitation will probably be enough for the quizzes multiple choice questions can be very tricky so beware be nice to your ta will boost your mark
3272,Ted  Magder,he reminds me of dr house expert in his field and very knowledgeable and engaging in class difficult for me though to figure out what he wants on some assignments gotten everything from a b to an so a bit confused because i feel like i did anything different but a good professor lots of reading
3273,Ted  Magder,took his intro class and when he offered business of media i jumped to take another class he taught even though it was on a friday an amazing teacher and really supportive if you reach out to him need to use the text book much and he was a pretty easy grader if you generally participated and did your blog entries
3274,Ted  Magder,this is a larger class that feels small because ted allows students to take control of their own learning he brings in great speakers from his contacts and the blogs longform sector analysis projects are useful to show future employers
3275,Ted  Magder,attendance not taken at lecture but necessary to attend to include lecture notes in essays multiple choice can be tricky class was quite enjoyable overall
3276,Darren  Hynes,thank goodness for his ta who mark the papers very hard dr.hynes knows a lot but he teach clearly the lectures structured impossible to take notes not the hardest prof on planet earth but nothing special
3277,Darren  Hynes,hmm he was alright knows a lot about what talking about and the topics were interesting but no good notes provided at all and way too much time spent on how to write an essay as opposed to the actual course material i learned most from the textbooks and got away with skipping class he yells at the class sometimes for stupid reasons
3278,Darren  Hynes,way too man unfair ratings he is kind helpful knowledgeable and a great person
3279,Darren  Hynes,darren hynes although whilst not always the most organized is very passionate about the material he teaches and is always willing to help his students worth taking a class or two with him
3280,Darren  Hynes,dr hynes is a nice professor but his classes seem unprepared and disorganized however he is very clear and sets his expectations the material is not hard but some of it has to be selftaught this class would have been much more engaging if he prepared his lectures but overall it is not a difficult course and is very interesting
3281,Darren  Hynes,hard to make history of witchcraft uninteresting but this prof does not seem to even know what talking about half the time he does not respond to students questions effectively and does not prepare lectures well he usually just ends up reading out of a book or showing us useless movie clips easy to get extensions on papers though
3282,Darren  Hynes,a nice guy but his lectures much beyond average if you have an interest in the subject he can be a really helpful guy but to the uninitiated his lectures seem a bit dull
3283,Darren  Hynes,a really nice guy but awful at lecturing he could put you to sleep his lectures were unorganized and make sense help with the way to much reading and dead boring texts not clear on what exams were based on his notes never make sense fair marker dead boring but kind and lenient
3284,Darren  Hynes,i found dr hynes very helpful he had a thorough knowledge of the course material and an overly hard marker he tended to lean towards the philosophical side of c european history which my area of interest but it too difficult he could stand to be a bit more exciting but i found him to be a really good prof
3285,Darren  Hynes,pretty useless enjoys walking around the class and rambling he do the actual marking but his teaching assistant marks fairly though slowly give notes and hard to tell what you should write down since he includes so much irrelevant content in his lectures take philosophy with flynn instead if you want
3286,Darren  Hynes,if you are intreseted in history take another class spent most of the time talking about essays and very little on actual subject no structure to lectures impossible to take notes
3287,Darren  Hynes,well i dont have much to say about this guy but i will say hes a easy marker but u have to study on your own cuz he doesnt give notes or slides but its ok course if u dont know nothing about philsophy then stay away or at least away from him
3288,Darren  Hynes,darren hynes is a horrible prof he makes going to class useless because he just stands up front and rambles incoherently theres no notes or structure and when asked to explain something he does so by responding with something else that you cannot understnad if you have to take this course do so with a different prof
3289,Darren  Hynes,i found this prof great very laid back and engages the class in his discussions eager to hear students thoughts especially in the area of morals and ethics he is a fair marker and very approachable to be honest i barely made it to class but had interest in the material and came out with an in the course
3290,Darren  Hynes,clearly out of his element with history no notes were given used often but gave little idea of all aspects in the course term definition midterm and a cheat sheet for the final that included definition terms and essay questions his ta was the only reason i did so well in this course he was useless
3291,Darren  Hynes,though a highly intelligent man with a kind heart darren is far from a great teacher his lectures are unengaging and often straight from the textbook and he gives poor guidance on assignments he does leave excellent feedback on papers but the fact remains that he simply cannot communicate the material meant to be teaching
3292,Darren  Hynes,i was a tad bit disappointed in this course he is all over the place with his work which gets a bit tedious though he is a nice guy and an easy marker i help but think that it is not his class to teach
3293,Darren  Hynes,i found darren hynes to be very approachable knowledgeable and efficient overall i will admit that i was bored in his lectures and found that he did little to make the course interesting but he marked students fairly and simply took all of the material straight from the book he my favourite but his course was relatively romper
3294,Darren  Hynes,although very unclear a great prof his lectures go all over the place but he relies on the texts so if you bring those to class understand his lectures willing to help and wants people to do well in his class he has a great knowledge of the subject matter but can be a little vague about what he wants in assignments
3295,Darren  Hynes,dr hynes is approachable and is extremely knowledgeable in his field his lectures can be funny but are usually dry however i found him to be a little too laid back and even vague at times i found his course to be neither good nor bad mediocre
3296,Rachelle  Sussman,this was my first mcc class i took and i loved every second she is the nicest person and always listens to what you have to say she is extremely clear and knowledgeable of the subject there is a lot of work but the essays are fun topics and if you do the work you should be fine
3297,Rachelle  Sussman,professor sussman is my favorite instructor at nyu thus far i was nervous at first because i like speaking out in class but she makes everyone feel comfortable and i feel like i have learned immense amounts in this course she is always friendly and although she gives a lot of work it is worth it especially if you plan on being an mcc major
3298,Rachelle  Sussman,best professor had thus far hands down she genuinely cares about her students and is an overall awesome person the class is very discussion based so very lively and student driven all of the things she expects you to know are in her presentations so honestly no need to read the stuff she assigns but most is cool take her
3299,Rachelle  Sussman,the discussion setup of humancomm makes the class a fair teacher always wants to hear what every student has to say and will never shut anyone down extremely nice and the class is fairly easy if you do your work a lot of reading and a few over the semester readings are helpful but only sometimes necessary around half the time
3300,Rachelle  Sussman,she gives the most work out of all the other professors who teach the same course
3301,Rachelle  Sussman,i had prof sussman for intro to media criticism her classes are very interesting and she knows what talking about really easy to get a good grade in the class as long as you listen to what she has to say the tests are a lot of writing but she prepares you really well
3302,Rachelle  Sussman,no comments
3303,Rachelle  Sussman,no comments
3304,Dion  Wiseman,doesnt understand students nowadays he expects too much he gave us our first exam the end of october and expected us to do well on chapters of studying
3305,Dion  Wiseman,tough but fair and willing to help but you gotta ask
3306,Dion  Wiseman,dr wiseman is an awesome professor he expects students to work for their marks which is the way it should be he uses great examples and has a great sense of humor i would definitely take more courses with him he is passionate about the topic and makes it easy to attend class overall i would rate him an professor
3307,Dion  Wiseman,year classes are easy upper year classes require a lot more investment in time a great guy and prof i went through some tough times and he helped me out more than most he knows his stuff cold
3308,Dion  Wiseman,marks easy in first year courses but in second and third year such as cart and geomorph he expects a great deal more although if you go to class and study high marks are quite possible
3309,Dion  Wiseman,wiseman seems to really know what talking about always willing to help even if he seems a bit aloof only complaint is that he has a tendency to assume his students know the materials as well as he does good attendance is reccommended but his tests are never very difficult
3310,Dion  Wiseman,he is a good prof who tries to ensure he is making each point with clear he is hard to approach however as he always seems busy make sure you have questions prepared prior to speaking to him or treat you like your stupid
3311,Dion  Wiseman,dr wiseman is very strict and has no patience for students that have families he does not make try and meet the needs of a student that is going through a hard time and also as well he does not narrow down what to study before an exam
3312,Dion  Wiseman,super class nice guy helpful easy to understand
3313,Dion  Wiseman,expectations are too high but he marks easy and is fair
3314,Dion  Wiseman,he has high expectations for his students but this only helps you to learn how to do it the right way once you get through his first years class his other classes are a breeze he just likes to weed out the dumb people
3315,Dion  Wiseman,a really cool prof young and has kids so he knows what like to have a life outside of classes the textbook is useful but most of the testing materials come from the lectures he also tells you what is going to be on each test which are not cumulative
3316,Dion  Wiseman,every moment spent in his classes was like staring directly into the face of god and having him stare back and say you are my most wonderous creation
3317,Dion  Wiseman,stop talking while writing i have no idea what you just said because i am trying to figure out what you are saying from the projector great teacher i must say but geez man better have a good outline for what you are specifically looking for on the exam unless you give us a day to write it name my next pet fish after you
3318,Dion  Wiseman,smart man only if he knew this is not a year course i give him an a on what he knows and a z for thinking that know as much as he does at the end of the course your laptop is garbage i sit there wishing he would just ease on his marking right vs wrong people get nervous too man not that cool
3319,Dion  Wiseman,chauvinistic favoritism can be a problem a good guy once he gets to know you
3320,Dion  Wiseman,there is no help here when needed cocky and you are never right
3321,Dion  Wiseman,easy to understand but could anyone be more cocky
3322,Dion  Wiseman,get past the rough exterior and a great prof shines through
3323,Dion  Wiseman,knows his stuff and will prove it
3324,Sue  Collins,if you are interested in successful professional and academic work in the notsodistant future this is a realistic professor to take a class with you can decide how much you can read and handle from an assignment standpoint professor collins is an excellent teacher who challenges her students to be the best they can be you ask for more
3325,Sue  Collins,beautiful woman she will challenge your mind until you ache from thinking but she is a genuine interesting and brilliant scholar she treats you like an adult meaning she is totally on your level but expects nothing less than professional work and vigorous discussion she is amazing and really disappointed that nyu is losing her
3326,Sue  Collins,i had sue for language thought and culture it was at in the morning and her great energy made it a lot of fun the class literally changed the way i view the world and role in absolutely everything it also was why i decided to go abroad
3327,Sue  Collins,i regret not dropping this class from the start there is just so much reading for this class almost unbelievable a really nice lady but i physically cannot keep up with the readings stay away if possible
3328,Sue  Collins,although she may be intimidating i can honestly say i learned more from her than any other professor if lazy then search elsewhere sue is a lively force she pushes you to produce your best work and gives you the education every student should hope for definitely a professor dedicated to her students and their educational well being
3329,Sue  Collins,i have never been so simultaneously entertained and intellectually stimulated by a professor until i took media crit taught by sue collins sure the class was challenging but never painful everything we learned was of critical importance to understanding the backbone our society sue learning enlightenment and great comedy
3330,Sue  Collins,i know what nyu students who complain about the difficulty of a given class expect from their education one thing to recognize a challenge but quite another to characterize such rigor as a shortcoming of the professor sue collins is an excellent prof who fairly challenges her students lazy individualsplease spare us your thoughts
3331,Sue  Collins,i had to drop this class she assigned literally three times more reading than the other professors for the same class also there is an incomprehensive quiz at the beginning of the class which asks random and trick quesitons almost half of the original class was gone within the first three classes
3332,Sue  Collins,collins taught two of my core classes ad and crit and was enthusiastic and extremely knowledgeable of the subject in both some longer assignments provided a chance to document and research historical advertising materials others included semiotic readings of various media very rewarding and foundational for myself
3333,Sue  Collins,sue is probably the best professor had probably gained more from her classes than from any other her enthusiasm about teaching was present in every single class i imagine people not liking her unless they want to do the work and learn i only wish all of my professors cared as much as she did
3334,Sue  Collins,if you will take this class you will feel as you are in the militery
3335,Sue  Collins,no comments
3336,Sue  Collins,her assignments and teaching styles were very unfocused while the reading was interesting the discussions following lacked insight and direction she refused to entertain viewpoints other than her own rigid ones which greatly inhibited the ability to learn
3337,Sue  Collins,no comments
3338,Sue  Collins,sue was a fun prof to have although the class was a bit vague and it was sometimes hard to tell what she wanted she was willing to help but sometimes stuff still make sense overall not a hard class for me but it was for some people
3339,Sue  Collins,sue is a very nice person but sometimes it feels as if the only right way is her way she can definitely be a very hard prof and she makes you work although she puts a lot of emphasis on class participation which is nice
3340,Sue  Collins,no comments
3341,Catherine  Chen,this class is pretty challenging consists of group project completed in class tests and many homework assignments chen is a great professor but the topic is hard to grasp you must put effort and time in this class to do well show up to class read chapters and ask questions and you should do okay confusing class but it is manageable
3342,Catherine  Chen,this class is really hard if you let it be you just have to pay attention in class do all the homework and class activities get on the tests and you will do fine dr chen is a cool lady and really relaxed she teaches really boring classes but does her best to help you learn the material
3343,Catherine  Chen,she is a great professor that will go out of her way to help you class is interesting however there are some concepts that are hard to grasp there really much homework at all other than reading the chapters from the book there are quizzes and a final but the final is just questions from the quizzes read go to class and take notes
3344,Catherine  Chen,a really great professor she knows her stuff you need to pay attention in class and seek help outside of class or you will fail the exams midterm and finals were both hands on final project used concepts from the entire semester the textbook is only used for studying so if you can borrow someones do that attendance is mandatory
3345,Catherine  Chen,the class is really tough due to lack of introductory material it jumps you right into the nitty gritty her tests are really hard but if you do well on the assignments and projects you are sure to get at least a b
3346,Catherine  Chen,i have had the honor of knowing dr chen she has been my throughout college she is one of the nicest most caring professors ever had she truly cares about each student and for their success she gives great homework feedback and is always willing to help we all call her our mom at school great professor
3347,Catherine  Chen,dr chen is an excellent professor she cares deeply about the success of her students and she is always willing to help pay attention during her lectures take notes and ask questions she is the best professor i have had a ball state
3348,Catherine  Chen,most instruction takes place with videos and through practical applications she is always quick to respond to questions and willing to help
3349,Catherine  Chen,she is a good teacher and the material in book are helpful for exam i think it is not a difficult class to pass if you do homework carefully
3350,Catherine  Chen,deffinatly my favorite isom professor she gets students engaged in class and connects with you oneonone available for help and if you understand something ask and clear things up and bring it to a level thats relatable to you you have to work for a good grade loved the class though
3351,Catherine  Chen,she thinks a good professor but her lectures are utterly pointless confusing and goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the class material i would probably look for a different professor in retrospect because although i received an a it was a stressful level class and i learned nothing
3352,Catherine  Chen,tests are almost impossible her grading is extreme and so hard to understand avoid at all costs
3353,Catherine  Chen,horrible avoid at all costs her tests are impossible and this class is very intense for a level class
3354,Catherine  Chen,easily the best isom professor i too have had her for semesters straight and her classes have been extremely rewarding serious in course work so expect to work hard for your grade while building useful skills for your first job she goes out of her way to make sure you succeed put forth the effort and return it tenfold
3355,Catherine  Chen,one of hardest working professors at ball state always very helpful with questions you may have and grades assignments very fast she makes an active effort to get her students interested in is and the course always responds to emails very quickly attendance is mandatory but every student should have her as a prof before graduation
3356,Catherine  Chen,great professor you get to know in the isom program takes a vested interest in students and makes a huge effort to assist in any way possible labs were engaging and better than powerpoint lectures stay on her good side and get to know her had her times now for my info sys major she is very knowledgeable and a great professor to take
3357,Catherine  Chen,dr chen is great she really tries to help you understand this material also available outside of class for extra help her tests can be complicated but if you study be fine a great prof and looking forward to future classes with her
3358,Catherine  Chen,professor chen generally knows what she is talking about but sometimes she is learning how to use programs as you are be patient and she will make sure you understand what you are doing do the case studys and you should get the a
3359,Catherine  Chen,very knowledgeable of the material and extremely helpful she will go out of her way to make sure that you succeed in her class
3360,Catherine  Chen,i had her and loved her she was so nice and helpful that it made the class interesting a lot of common sense but you still have to do all the work and study to do well just stay on top of things and you should come out of class with an a
3361,Terry  Moran,do not take this class you will hate your life and contemplate dropping out of college
3362,Terry  Moran,literally so unclear grades papers harshly take his class going to regret your life if you take his class
3363,Terry  Moran,obvious that moran is very intelligent in this field but this is by far the worst class that i have taken at nyu he makes you write three page papers that are worth of your grade and participation is worth it is basically impossible to get an a he leaves rude comments that make you feel horrible terrible teacher and class
3364,Terry  Moran,please for the love of god do not take this man he is rude comes up with outlandish course guidelines and is extremely condescending expect nice comments or constructive feedback just make sure to inhale as much breath as you can every day before class since his ego takes up most of the room look closely and not even smart
3365,Terry  Moran,he is by far the worst professor i had at nyu he does not elaborate on what he actually wants to see on the paper and if you follow the protocol you get anything higher than a b or c i went to see him outside of class for the second paper and everything he told me to put on the paper was wrong when he returned it
3366,Terry  Moran,worst professor i had at nyu by far always confused in class papers are absolute nightmares based on his crazy model they have no thesis and cause you to repeat yourself incessantly and then come to no conclusion his markings are very rude and his grading harsh impossible to meet with and gives days to write page papers awful
3367,Terry  Moran,five weeks into the semester and never regretted taking a class more the comments he leaves on ungraded homework assignments are hurtful and upsetting they make me feel stupid do not take this class i listen to past reviewers do not make the same mistake i made unless you want to cry regularly beyond rude and terrible
3368,Terry  Moran,lectures are a complete waste of time unfortunately he takes attendance so you have to go or get someone to sign you in are easy if you study and have a good ta the key to enjoying this class is having a good ta that being said professor moran is sweet and very understanding i recommend you take him you learn a lot
3369,Terry  Moran,moran is the worst professor i have ever had at nyu extremely unreasonable grading and no clear direction was provided unreasonable grader uninteresting class uninsightful marker rude human being and just a pain to be around do not take his class ever you have been warned
3370,Terry  Moran,i genuinely loved class very insightful he had a lot to share in great material and also personal experience highly recommended
3371,Terry  Moran,i am a senior at nyu and he remains the worst teacher i have ever had at nyu horrible avoid at all costs history of media and comm with moran is a class that makes the quality of education at nyu look pathetic
3372,Terry  Moran,worst teacher i have had at nyu ridiculous paper guidelines and horrible grading tactics the point of this class is not to learn the point of this class is to try to guess what he wants you to write and write about that you are required to attend class and my grade was actually dropped a grade because i missed two classes more than allotted
3373,Terry  Moran,are silly ridiculous structure not cohesive and fails to resemble an academic paper follow his instructions and avoid using any original thought or creative exploration his lectures are repetitive and antidotal and often adress the subject no possibility of a shared learning experience because he already knows everything
3374,Terry  Moran,had him for history of comm last semester work load hard but was tedious had to write essays on every few chapters of his book for lectures he basically recited his book that he wrote so no one went to class easy grade
3375,Terry  Moran,professor moran is the most adorable man he is extremely helpful and down to earth follow instructions to his essays perfectly and you will get an easy a he is not looking to trick anyone just trying to get you to follow his lectures if you show up to class you might also make a letter grade difference he respects students who respect him
3376,Terry  Moran,his lectures may be entertaining because he is so knowledgeable and incorporates many anecdotes but i have not had good experiences with him in person he has been extremely rude to me and i have witnessed him be rude to other students it ruined my experience to say the least
3377,Terry  Moran,really have a book or lessons plan mostly anecdotal lectures not really any work to do besides one final long paper
3378,Terry  Moran,mostly irrelevant anecdotal lectures but overall a nice guy weird essay assignments but easy once you get the hang of them the way i found was to number the questions and then write the numbers in the book by info that will be helpful in answering that question then your essay is mostly quotes
3379,Terry  Moran,i had him for history of comm and he was so knowledgeable his essays are really particular but as long as you follow directions get a good grade what he talks about in lectures is good info for his essays overall a fairly interesting class
3380,Terry  Moran,i had terry for mass persuasion and propaganda and absolutely loved him and the class i definitely recommend it
3381,William  Stoever,this man is a genius he was by far the best professor i had at western his lectures were insightful meticulous and often times hilarious best of all he tactfully and efficiently poke fun of idiots i.e his grammar lectures after an essay test
3382,William  Stoever,great lecturer if you can get past and provides good indepth examples and great summaries you can study for tests from them and is always available to help he expects you to read the material prior to class and loves relevant questions read come to lectures daily and get an easy a
3383,William  Stoever,i counted the number of and and there were in minutes i found i was so distracted by his speech impediment that i focus on the words in between the a stubborn old man who grades unfairly his tests are long and hard the reading was difficult to keep up with as well this class was a gpa killer
3384,William  Stoever,knows his stuff and expects you too as well he called out some kid in class because the kid made a dumb comment i like that lots of reading tests are hard going to class is essential use pencils
3385,William  Stoever,long lecture feels even longer because of his lecturing style difficult to understand his lecture but plentiful class notes make up for it difficult to prepare for the examines since there is no study guide whatsoever too much reading and even the reading materials are boring he even changed the exam format a week before the final
3386,William  Stoever,it was difficult to stay awake during the lectures and pay attention i the reading tended to be more interesting than class the information is interested but stoever deliver it well to say the least not a hard class but i recommend it
3387,William  Stoever,very boring likes to walk as he talks and his facial expessions are histerical good info but hard to hear what he says
3388,William  Stoever,this was the most boring class i have ever taken at western i got the worst grade in this class i have ever gotten in college he has an interesting sense of humor but i think he is rude and it is very impossible to follow his lectures without falling asleep because is voice is monotone i go to class without falling asleep stay away
3389,William  Stoever,one of my favorite profs has a very dry sophisticated sense of humor an awesome lecturer each hour is well planned and information efficiently delivered he does make some funny grammar comments when handing tests else the brahmin priest offers a sacrifice on the altar the vet alters the puppy dog all in good fun
3390,William  Stoever,most boring professor i have ever had very monotonous very difficult to follow at times assigned too much reading for fulltime students
3391,William  Stoever,interesting but the reading is very dry prof is very particular about grammer and spelling on essay tests he is a little dry but the material is interesting
3392,William  Stoever,he is a brilliant man one of the best lectures i have had very concise take a lot of notes very interesting if you do most of the reading and have an understanding of the basic concepts you will do fine
3393,William  Stoever,stoever is overflowing with knowledge and he has that sketchy genius personality that i dig in a prof probably one of the most influential professors had to date
3394,William  Stoever,finally a professor who made me feel like i was in college i loved stoever and the class incredibly intelligent and has a a pretty funny sense of humor that you have to kind of catch take really good notes study hard and watch your grammar on the exams and do great highly recommende
3395,William  Stoever,smartest prof ever he and dr stoops are literally the smartest people i have ever met all his classes are great be sure to take very good notes people claim hard but he really just take crap from dumb people great experience highly reccommended
3396,William  Stoever,very hard material very knowledgable
3397,William  Stoever,brilliant has a sense of humor you get exactly what you put into it work hard and be one of the best classes take
3398,William  Stoever,dr stoever is the best professor ever had at western he is brilliant interesting and truly passionate about the subject i recommend him to everyone he is however very very tough take this class if you prepared to read and listen lots but totally worth it
3399,William  Stoever,oh my god a professor that actually challenges his students more than a high school teacher and covers the material in depth as fits the job lets all get online and write bad reviews because somebody assumed that we were actually intelligent enough to handle being taught like adults
3400,William  Stoever,lectures are interesting but not always clear the reading load and tests are very reasonable it is important to read the material for clarification he also pays close attention to grammar and spelling on tests
3401,Paul  Sparks,paul was the voice that i needed when i was just coming into my own as an artist and photographer he made me concentrate on mediums outside of my comfort zone and was critical but encouraging i be where i am without him
3402,Paul  Sparks,im a little sad to see so few reviews for sparks he is great alot of people hate him with good reason hes an antagonizer he has no idea how to do anything other than make you feel something hes not a a old man sharing all that he knows and it may or not be alot but he gets under skin better than a sliver he does name drop he d
3403,Paul  Sparks,definitely the best professor i had while attending evergreen and art school incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the art world and a fun professor i feel he really helped my work grow and pushed me as a woman i find him to be anti at all his retirement is a huge loss to the evergreen students
3404,Paul  Sparks,picks favorites biased made creepy jokes around me when i was alone with a girl uses the same slides for lectures over over i like him at all
3405,Paul  Sparks,a name dropper what more do i have to say anyone who takes his advice to heart is a fool
3406,Paul  Sparks,paul picks favorites paul has his own agenda paul has his own agenda for what you should do with yourself be careful especially if you end up being a favorite some say he lives vicariously through the work of his students all gonna say is that he has an agenda for you and for your work
3407,Paul  Sparks,take his class if a not if a woman why not transcend to substance not out to judge anyone personally art can not just because got no talent personal working process style has to been criticized to improve selfinvolved catharcism is why no one gives about art we have to take drastic steps towards art that actually rocks paul has crystalized this vision that may never be seen again if been seen before come this unstuffy
3408,Paul  Sparks,a horrible lecturer and a poor class planner but honest when it comes to the art world outside the classroom his teaching style antiwoman but definitely antifeminist
3409,Paul  Sparks,overall good guy and fun to talk to however his art knowledge is primarily based in the late and says all art is cyclical and therefor has no need to go to see any new art because he has already seen something like it years ago he claims to retire every year for the last yrs and it shows so get it over with and hire fresh
3410,Paul  Sparks,amazing teacher really liked him brilliant artistically highly recommended him a treasure
3411,Paul  Sparks,paul is very knowledgeable and very reasonable he wants you to participate in your own education i am a woman and i had no problem with him
3412,Paul  Sparks,no comments
3413,Paul  Sparks,no comments
3414,Paul  Sparks,no comments
3415,Paul  Sparks,stay away if a woman
3416,Paul  Sparks,paul is oldschool evergreen and close to retirement take his class before gone practical and nononsense and has a great sense of humor he also happens to know many of the prominent american photographers from the last years
3417,Jon  Brotherton,dr b is pretty legit super easy going and there is no possible way to fail his class people have legit sat in class and listened to music during his lectures and still make on tests
3418,Jon  Brotherton,very kind and approachable never made me feel uncomfortable because not a music major
3419,Jon  Brotherton,he is a mellow guy never had a prob with him very easy style of teaching
3420,Jon  Brotherton,no comments
3421,Jon  Brotherton,the best
3422,Clyde  Matthews,very nice guy his class is just made up of attendance and take home quizzes that are questions for each chapter just do the quizzes during the lecture and show up very very very easy a
3423,Clyde  Matthews,this class is the easiest i have ever taken he is a little boring and rambules a lot but he gives all take home quizes and all the questions for the midterm and final are from the quizes.he is a sweet older guy
3424,Clyde  Matthews,horrible i stand sitting through his pointless lectures that even pertain to the material being covered he mumbles on and on and he gives out too many take home quizes that are extremely time consuming
3425,Clyde  Matthews,when i took him last semester he was cool this semester is differnt he isnt very helpful anymore bcuz people took advantage of him im a strait a student and i failed the midterm bcuz he wont help on the chapters any more which sucks he does give extra credit though beware he changes dont know what he will be like next semester
3426,Clyde  Matthews,very slow and rambles on about things that pertain to the lesson boring is the word
3427,Clyde  Matthews,he does babble on in class about useless kids and but hes an awesome guy you have to maintain a all assignments and not miss more than the amount of absences and you dont have to take the was a huge stess relief at exam week.but just in case u do have to take the exam refer to your quiz book and b
3428,Clyde  Matthews,quiz book needs revision lots of work but very easy
3429,Clyde  Matthews,if you have to give the class a revised textbook how about a revised quizbook cons boring opinionated mumbling subjectchanging.pros very knowlegable nice guy
3430,Clyde  Matthews,an extremely easy a if you mind listening to the ramblings of an older prof whose lectures are too much useless opinion and not enough substance
3431,Clyde  Matthews,very easy a hes not to good of a teacher but if youre looking for an easy a that is the teacher for you
3432,Clyde  Matthews,he lectured on alot of history around the he never covered much material after that although we still had to take quizzes on it a nice person but became mundane after a while
3433,Clyde  Matthews,as an older professor he has good insights in the history classes very flexible and the assignment are very easy take this course to get a pretty easy a
3434,Clyde  Matthews,i had mr matthews and i thought he was very nice and his class was easy anyone looking for a easy a take this class
3435,Clyde  Matthews,stop giving your own opinion on every single topic and let the class interact every once in a while
3436,Rogers,best bio professor ever he gives great feedback everyone should take his classes i know i will continue to take his classes
3437,Rogers,if you have to take this class please do not take it with this teacher because he is extremely hard i took him for basic bio and currently taken his anatomy class on line and man does he make the questions hard to find i passed his bio class with an and now trying to pass his anatomy class on line with at least an take him
3438,Rogers,is a very dull instructor has practice questions on blackboard which are actually on the tests lets you use a card with notes for each test which helps alot most of the questions come from lecture notes also on blackboard i would not recommend him unless you have no choice he does take attendance via sign in sheet
3439,Rogers,really nice the class is easy but make sure you study from the book
3440,Rogers,i would not recommend this teacher to my worse enemy.he is very boring and to me he does not know what he is talking about.if you ask for tells you that he went over it already and that the notes were on the board.he will totally put you to sleep.if you have to take this class please do not take this guy
3441,Rogers,i am sure he is a nice guy but he does not know how to teach he graded one of our lab tests and then i noticed that he had graded unfairly on my test that was the beginning of him being on my bad side he is not prepared whatsoever he would say something and then do another do not hold him to his word drop his not take it from him
3442,Rogers,doesnt really seem to know what hes talking about he is very nice but the class is unorganized you never know what the test is going to be like you even know what to study you never use the book and he gets off topic and starts talking about his life frequently
3443,Rogers,i took his health class online it is so easy pretty interesting too you do need the book to answer the biweekly which are easy only a couple of questions and open book u dont need to read the book the discussions are based on your own opinions the only projects are diet analysis and one paper on any health subjec
3444,Rogers,he really does know what talking about and a really nice guy but he really know how to teach he goes through a lot of slide shows that pretty much copy paste what the book says you must work hard in this class because you get too much from the lectures just too boring take him if not interested
3445,Rogers,took week summer class with jerry nice man just goes on very long tangents we do over half the labs and never had a lab quiz attendance and labs were worth of our grade so you pretty much had to attend very easy but did not feel i got my moneys worth
3446,Rogers,i took him for an online class and have any issues there is a lot of reading assignments but the class was interesting and kept me focused assignments were pretty straightforward except for the diet log which some of the instructions were a little unclear he is a fair teacher and made my first online class a breeze
3447,Rogers,a really decent professor not too dynamic but very fair and friendly easy to get along with
3448,Rogers,he gets off track from time to time but otherwise is interesting he certainly is not a bad teacher and you will learn something from his class
3449,Rogers,all you haters must have been morons rogers is the best science dept teacher there is i enjoyed coming to class and learning the enviornment is laid back and everyone is friendly and participates along with the teacher i learned the most from this class believe the negative comments
3450,Rogers,aww i read some negative feedback about mr rogers but not true a good teacher and kinda lets things slide just smoke around him because he says smoking destroys cilia but we all know it paralyzes it keep up the good work he is good teacher
3451,Rogers,i think much of him when i first started classes but awesome if you ever have a question or are a bit behind he helps give him a chance your education dollars are well spent
3452,Rogers,if you are looking for a class where you learn nothing and everybody fails then this class is for you the longest managed to stay awake was to count how many times he said um he avereage ums per mins but good class for insomniacs smells funny like a old shoe
3453,Rogers,drop he never gets to the point he never knows what teaching he fails everyone you teach yourself the work and besides he does not write his test or grade them so he does not teach you whats on the test good class to skip and sleep threw
3454,Rogers,boring he rambles without ever getting to the point his tests seem to be difficult but it might be because he never gets to the point recommend him unless you need to catch up on some sleep
3455,Rogers,he didnt even know what he was doing us students helped him too much its good he is only part time but he shouldnt even be a teacher i did get a he didnt even take attendance and i didnt even go to lab
3456,Therese  Saliba,worked with her on contract and found her to be extremely knowledgable she opened my eyes to the atrocities happening in todays world and helped me find new ways to reach my students she is a wonderful woman and a joy to work with
3457,Therese  Saliba,really good for an introduction to me studies weak as far as covering different sides of an argument but does use a broad arrangement of texts
3458,Therese  Saliba,unfortunately she is just not qualified to teach about the middle east rather than providing students with knowledge they need to engage and combat the paradigms in question she attempts to train them as activists perhaps this is because her knowledge base is in english literature and is seriously lacking in history and politics of the region
3459,Therese  Saliba,awesome
3460,Therese  Saliba,therese deals in the study of marginalized voicesthe views and experiences not heard in popular education i think she is amazing and one of the best professors ever had she was always encouraging never dominated in seminar and has vast knowledge of feminist studies and the middle east she is awesome
3461,Therese  Saliba,no comments
3462,Therese  Saliba,therese is a hard professor who expects a lot from her students but is fair and supportive her lectures are well organized engaging and intelligent a brillant woman who knows what teaching she gives a lot of feed back on papers with helpful comments i urge anyone to take a class from therese before they graduate
3463,Therese  Saliba,therese is the best i highly recommend her to everyone as far as her being biased towards palestinians she presents a balanced view of middle eastern issues often exploring elements our traditional media ignores she is not the easiest but you will learn alot from her if you open your mind and think critically about the material presented
3464,Therese  Saliba,people say she is biased towards palestinians but are you kidding me thank goodness cause i see a lot of folks pulling for palestine in the in other regards a valient professor who keeps and open mind towards other views
3465,Therese  Saliba,exteremly biased against israel even though she claims to keep an open mind she presented one side of the struggle in the middle east and provided little voice for the other side to make its case this class does not present a fair academic look at this complicated situation
3466,Therese  Saliba,her middle eastern studies class was slanted towards palestinians but not by very far not nearly as bad as the slant towards israel that you see on the news every day she assigned a book a week for a credit week class the roots of terrorism class been called roots of arab terrorism because all we covered it was basically a modern history class oh and we watched really informative and entertaining videos
3467,Therese  Saliba,she is very passionate and involved with her subject she will help direct you towards your own passion within the subject of middle east studies
3468,Therese  Saliba,no comments
3469,Therese  Saliba,she promised a tough academic environment but lost many papers and let seminar turn into personal stories i asked if we could talk about the books she said i was being argumentative and i should keep my opinions to myself my classmates exhibited more maturity than she did
3470,Therese  Saliba,super awesome at everything concerning literature feminism or the middle east great at explaining assignments in multiple ways if you hare having trouble understanding what she is looking for excellent feedback on all writing all around great
3471,Therese  Saliba,therese is the best professor had at evergreen she is very knowledgeable and wellread but not arrogant she is great at running seminars which is so important at tesc i hope i can take more credits from her in the future
3472,Eva  Sadowski,i like how she asks for feedback during the course
3473,Eva  Sadowski,condescending her way or the highway
3474,Eva  Sadowski,do your readings or suffer her wrath

3480,Hwan  Kim,thick accent hard to understand but straight forward follows the book his tests are not very hard and he is very liberal with his grading
3481,Hwan  Kim,he follows the text book and refers to many of the diagrams he calls them examples most classes are lecture for first half then a computer lab which usually involves some web browsing and answering some questions tests are an

3489,Robert  Burton,this man is the absolute worst professor ever had the displeasure of interacting with arrogant begin to describe him weekly blog articles that are short essay length vague grading rubric he will not give you an a unless you stroke his oversized ego turn things in well before the due date or he will mark you down take it
3490,Robert  Burton,has around blogs and group presentations allows the blogs to be revised for higher grade grades fairly and offers extra credit be prepared to read a lot and participate in class discussions blogs make up a large of grade
3491,Robert  Burton,weekly blog posts are long boring and graded very harshly he also does not give feedback would not recommend to other students
3492,Robert  Burton,i said so many papers because the weekly blog posts have to be minimum words given a chance to make them up he uses an emoji grading system on the blog posts so i constantly had to look at the syllabus to see whether i got a or or whatever do the blog posts every week they are a huge part of your final grade real make or break
3493,Robert  Burton,tough at grading but makes it clear that he wants you to write wellwritten blogs that look and prove that read the texts and have thought critically about them british so his humor is rather dry and sarcastici loved it very nice as long as you are respectful
3494,Robert  Burton,take no respect for students or their opinions super sarcastic and rude reading is heavy and the only aspect of the class i enjoyed that had nothing to do with him he grades writing assignments in emojis winky face glasses is an a while frowny face smile is a c upset i wasted my limited time and money on a course like this
3495,Robert  Burton,dr burton requires his students to write weekly a lot work if you miss class it will hurt grade even if you complete all the work i take him again
3496,Robert  Burton,he is the worst teacher ever had he is very rude and care about the students
3497,Robert  Burton,rob burton while a very interesting instructor who is at times thoughtprovoking to listen to i will not take again he has a very weird grading scale reading specific blogs which are the primary source of our grades in this class are graded not with letter grades or percentages but rather smileyfaces he is also quite sarcastic
3498,Robert  Burton,the guy is a complete ass he is rude to his students if you come in late need to use the bathroom or ask a question he makes a scene but it is an easy class he wont tell you your grade tho you should just know it
3499,Robert  Burton,he grades really weird but there is enough opportunity for extra credit
3500,Robert  Burton,week summer study abroad class in chiang mai thailand not an easy class but was doable by completing the reading and finishing the required weekly blogs and hours of community service one of the best experiences of my life tony waters combo rob burton was great at the end of classes you will end up being sadder but wiseer got
3501,Robert  Burton,took this for my theme class tons of writing and reading but hey its english cultural events were actually very interesting and enjoyable i did a few extras of those class time is just book discussion and i hope the soccer book is never used again and most people in the class feel the same way he was very upset when he found this out
3502,Robert  Burton,class is more like a book club class was huge about people call you out for talking or leaving early so dont do it actually stop class until you contribute you learn a lot from the cultural events you attend its hard to get into the grove of writing pages a week in blogs because he wants them done a very certain way
3503,Robert  Burton,great class
3504,Robert  Burton,rob is a good teacher i loved this class because there were very few student and we just talked about multicultural lit and pedagogical standpoints i enjoyed most of the books and the blogs were a good medium for homework i would take another of class
3505,Robert  Burton,this class was pointless no more than a book club learn a thing online blogs were a joke as a teacher he was good not the most patient gets a little frustrated when his point getting across but always means well he cares about your grade and will work with you very helpful in office hours take him in another class
3506,Robert  Burton,rob burton has his flaws but grow on you his class is great he always assigns great texts leads interesting discussions and the use of informal blogs for homework is fun and engaging he can be irritable from time to time but i take it personally not such a cold fish oneonone as he seems in class recommended
3507,Robert  Burton,is really passionate about his job for an english class it was a piece of cake i would recommend it to anyone he is very easy going and cares i felt bad not going to his classes he assign much but when he does make sure to do the work he expects that and will call you out great class
3508,Robert  Burton,engl353 was one of the easiest classes i took at chico state for those who complain they must have been really lazy i skimmed chapters and wrote blogs those are his assignments and got an a rob is easy going guy and shows a lot of videos in class open to different opinions
3509,Patricia  Mancini,very nice and helpful very enthusiastic about microorganisms and infectious diseases allowed me an extension on my paper
3510,Patricia  Mancini,this is the best professor to take if you are not a biology major she understands that the class is not made up of majors and presents the material a way that is easily understandable the class is sometimes boring but attendance is not mandatory i would highly reccommend the professor for biology class
3511,Patricia  Mancini,shes a good teacher but you have to study a lot to do well on the tests shes very helpful tho and will answer questions and give extra credit
3512,Patricia  Mancini,shes nice some of the time other times shes can be really mean and nasty wont answer questions degrades you if shes in a bad mood and asks if you know how to read id advise not to ask her questions during lab but do everything possible to find the answer yourself not bad of a grader she knows what she is talking about
3513,Patricia  Mancini,really good professor science my best subject but i did pretty well in this class she understands that many of her students bio majors and teaches the material in a way easy to understand there are tests and a final exam mostly multiple choice with or essays questions i definitely recommend her
3514,Patricia  Mancini,really nice and understanding professor go see her if you ever need any help
3515,Patricia  Mancini,nice professor pretty lenient gives extra credit tests are pretty easy very knowledgeablejust ask her questions
3516,Patricia  Mancini,great professor makes subhjects as interesting as they could be and gets the points of class along very well she moves pretty quick but if you can keep up its all good difficult class but if you keep up with it you can get an a extra credit was also offered
3517,Patricia  Mancini,nice lady but kind of stand offish i found that she doesnt seem to like to answer questions she says to read the packet quizzes are pretty easy def read the lab packet before class because she goes through the explanations pretty fast
3518,Patricia  Mancini,enjoyed her class
3519,Patricia  Mancini,horrible mundane and teaches by reading directly off her powerpoints not to mention you understand her powerpoints does not care if students are interested in material and does not try to make it interesting would not recommend
3520,Patricia  Mancini,very good at what she does she knows her stuff great course am taking her for more classes
3521,Patricia  Mancini,she sucks answers all questions with read the book subject is boring as hell already and she makes biology worse think that was possible
3522,Patricia  Mancini,good teacher
3523,Patricia  Mancini,very wild and hyperactive goes pretty quick nice lady but certainly not the best bio teacher out there
3524,Patricia  Mancini,no comments
3525,Patricia  Mancini,loved her if she teaching about deadly bacteria she could fit in just as well baking cookies a real grandma type there is no such thing as a min conversation her love the powerpoints
3526,Patricia  Mancini,very helpful tries to make sure all students understand the material very willing to spend extra time and effort for extra help just go to class and try to participate
3527,Patricia  Mancini,mancini is nice though she seems like in a hurry all the time you will learn the material but necessarily have fun doing it

3530,Karlene  Ferrante,if i wanted to be talk to like a kid id go to a day care this woman talk to her students like we are years old
3531,Karlene  Ferrante,very invested in her students will do anything to help them succeed
3532,Karlene  Ferrante,this prof talks to you like you are a child of not an adult of a joke been in something so juvenile since grade insulting learn a thing from her good thing students do her job for her she seem to respect students enough to talk to them as adults i pay thousands to be treated like avoid
3533,Karlene  Ferrante,grades work against each other not against a rubric has student groups teach subjects for her and the highlight of the course class only covers the easiest theories that learn better in other comm classes super easy workload and be fine this course is about pleasing her so just play her game
3534,Karlene  Ferrante,students actually teach the class most of the time with group presentations ferrante has no problem with interrupting a presentation to put in her two cents but her comments are always helpful very easy class
3535,Karlene  Ferrante,very friendly helpful and responds to questions outside of class quickly complete assignments and speeches the exact way she lays out she is sort of my way or the highway but lays out the requirements clearly do exactly what she says and get an a or b no problem she grades attendance and missing class causes major points off
3536,Karlene  Ferrante,at first when attending class it seemed like it would be a ton of work this turned out to be one of the best classes ever taken she works with students and the students present on the theories in class a great way to learn we did activities and got to know everyone in the class honestly one of the best professors ever had
3537,Karlene  Ferrante,the class that bad but she the best professor the whole class is having groups teach a chapter this is fine but she interrupts a lot during presentations and let the group complete what they were saying
3538,Karlene  Ferrante,we were supposed to learn how to write a literature review what the difference between a research question and a hypothesis is how to write acedemic papers at the graduate level instead we wrote undergrad level papers about our feelings no instruction from her on how to find previous research had no idea how to write a lit review epic fail
3539,Karlene  Ferrante,maps were a pain and graded subjectively the essay exams and group presentations were no different professor is not very yielding in any manner
3540,Karlene  Ferrante,this professor was very hard but actually did a really good job teaching the content at first the concept maps were a pain but they actually were the best learning tool ever no studying involved in this class just homework and groupwork
3541,Karlene  Ferrante,this class was really easy the workload high at all i think some people are just too lazy to do a minute assignment before class a very easy grader and even gives you opportunities to miss assignments without a penalty you teach the class twice with a group and also easy it take much planning at all easy
3542,Karlene  Ferrante,this was one of my favorite classes that i have taken she is a great lady and the class not only learn from her and the book but from eachother and life experiences i loved how she approached the material i would definately take it and whoever claims the workload is high its a daily concept map that you get to use on the test
3543,Karlene  Ferrante,pretty good
3544,Karlene  Ferrante,she puts too much of a workload on her students and she even teach she has groups present and teach straight from the book hello who is the professor not to mention her grading scale is very steep you have to be a perfectionist to get an a you have no idea how she grades exams and what she looks for so good luck
3545,Karlene  Ferrante,a very nice and pleasant woman and easy to talk to her class can get a little boring at times too many group presentations it gets old fast and daily homework assignments but the subject was actually pretty interesting think comm theory would be boring but it is so applicable to real life that interesting to study
3546,Karlene  Ferrante,the class really difficult but she assigns a lot of homework and two group presentations throughout the semester which require a lot of work you can use your notes on tests all essay but she really tell you what looking for so grades can be hit and miss her grading scale is tougher than most an a is and above
3547,Karlene  Ferrante,this is my favorite class i have taken ever prof style is very different and she requires us to give two teaching presentations but the atmosphere of the classroom is very comfortable and the topics are interesting i highly reccomend taking her classes
3548,Karlene  Ferrante,i had this class years ago and i have to say she was a great professor for comunications speeches suck and can be scary but it wasnt bad in her class very good learning environment she was one of my favorite teachers at uwsp
3549,Karlene  Ferrante,solid professor she teaches with a great deal of enthusiasm which is great and extrememly understanding and helpful
3550,Elizabeth  Spievak,she allows you to use notes on the tests but her questions on the tests are so out of the blue she has you read and write down questions regarding the text before almost every class and if thorough it could take around two hours her lectures are not posted online and they mostly consist of confusing charts or pointless stock photos worst
3551,Elizabeth  Spievak,professor spievak is super knowledgeable and cognitive psych is so interesting this class is definitely not for you if you dont enjoy reading articles writing essays or taking lecture notes without a powerpoint i personally did really well and liked her a lot as a person would take a class with her again
3552,Elizabeth  Spievak,the way she structures her class is meaningful and makes sense with the subject you are expected to take the time to read all the materials she provides and take notes on everything for psych majors this class is important she is kind and funny and participating in class is easy to do and can be fun she expects you to do the work
3553,Elizabeth  Spievak,one of the best professors ever had definitely not easy but learn a lot if you do the work
3554,Elizabeth  Spievak,dr spievak is a nice person but as a professor i would never take a class with her again cognitive psych was a nightmare she assigns long dry readings for every single class and you not have a quiz on every single reading or class period no powerpoints just speaks what you need to know very hard grader never satisfied
3555,Elizabeth  Spievak,very professional and focused on her work keeps students best interests at heart and pushes them beyond their comfort zone in order to better then
3556,Elizabeth  Spievak,dr spievak is an outstanding instructor she is an expert in her field as long as you put in the work and dedication she will ensure that you do great she genuinely cares and your work in her class can without a doubt take you far beyond the class itself she prepares you for grad school do not take if you willing to work for it
3557,Elizabeth  Spievak,i will never take her ever again you guys say no text book is a plus but with cognitive psychology you need a textbook and also the fact that she do actual power points with notes she expects u to read a bunch of articles but heaven help you if you miss one day of reading i will say she tries to make it fun as possible
3558,Elizabeth  Spievak,the reviews about this professor below regarding what type of course work is expected during this class are accurate however if you want to work with somebody that wishes to challenge you into becoming a better student i suggest this professor tough but she cares and if you put in the necessary effort and work hard you will see that
3559,Elizabeth  Spievak,grades with check check plus etc like in kindergarten very tough at grading too many readings the are timed and you are expected to write full essays during the talks too quickly attendance is mandatory quizzes at beginning and end of class horrible know how i passed
3560,Elizabeth  Spievak,she is all over the place quizzes time you meet she expects that you can write a perfect essay in minutes these are her quizzes tons of reading to do along with participation essays at the end of the class which is timed graded as well as the quizzes she is extremely picky when she grades get a b if you lucky
3561,Elizabeth  Spievak,she definitely has a way of making a room silent when she walks in she keeps order in the class and demands respect to visitors i enjoyed this class not much to it just show up and listen mainly others doing presentations she wont let you show up sign in and leave very observant i recommend this class if you are serious about psyc
3562,Elizabeth  Spievak,i am an older student who takes her classes seriously and this was the worst class i have ever taken do not take unless last resort very hard and confusing barely keeping afloat
3563,Elizabeth  Spievak,she has the ability to walk into a room and bring silence she terrifies me but at the same time i think awesome i have no doubt she could be mean to some students but because she has really high standards and expects you to work very hard to live up to them underneath her exterior she actually does care about students a lot
3564,Elizabeth  Spievak,well i came into this class with a high expectation of this professor since friends of mine really enjoyed her class i found her extraordinarily difficult she has you write numerous papers that have questions that are very difficult she expects masters level work out of a undergraduate class take her unless you have lots of time
3565,Elizabeth  Spievak,such a great topic with an obnoxious arrogant and hateful lady come and see the way she often embarrass people in the class she is too uptight and the course materials has nothing to do with the course itself looks like what she googled off the web i regret taking this class
3566,Elizabeth  Spievak,i should have waited till i had taken more psyc classes before because her quizzes are essay format and maybe this would help but if go to every class pay notes you will do awesome and enjoy it of all the classes taken now psyc classes i use what learned here the most in school and at home highly recommend
3567,Elizabeth  Spievak,she talks relentlessly and cuts no slack for anyone she like to answer questions or clarify what she means on assignments her tests are hard and she seems really excited about her material too bad she completely kills the fun out of it
3568,Elizabeth  Spievak,took her special topics class she is a brilliant woman and very excited about the material as others said her class will be your life for the semester and she is tough but you will learn a lot do not take for an easy a or if you just want to skate by if willing to work hard you will learn tons
3569,Elizabeth  Spievak,great professor everyone who does well in her class loves her if you understand her style of teaching you should do well if you are a bad notetaker you will not do well she is excellent and i have taken classes now with her and a lab each better than the first
3570,William  Goldstein,class has both lecture and discussion hear him in lecutre which was often not relevant he often went way over on time not a classskipper but did several times with this one though discussion was mandatory his paper assignment was impossible and he was little help
3571,William  Goldstein,nice guy and very intelligent class can sometimes get boring but usually when the dumb student talk too much arjun is a great ta and helped me more than anyone get into a top grad school
3572,William  Goldstein,awesome psych made fun very comprehensive really makes you want to be a psych major great class loved it loved it loved it
3573,William  Goldstein,knows a lot but is not very engaging in his communication of that knowledge socially awkward not good as stimulating class discussion but is really nice
3574,William  Goldstein,vey interesting topic though lecture is dry professor is very nice and knows a lot ta also teaches very well and is very cute
3575,John  Everitt,he is a great prof very helpful and dylan also keeps him going lectures are boring tests are ridiculous but not hard his classes are all the same also he reminds me of the sloth off of ice age
3576,John  Everitt,awesome professor best that i have had yet
3577,John  Everitt,it was an interesting course and i am glad i took it you learn alot of neat things about culture geography and how everything interacts really cool tests are equal yet really test your knowledge study
3578,John  Everitt,interesting course and easy to follow
3579,John  Everitt,re class size do you seriously think it is the fault that the class is so large and for those of you who complain about his by the book style would prefer he not touch on the books in class but test you on it anyways anyways this guy is a great prof
3580,John  Everitt,one of the worst profs ever had lectures were a joke most question that he tests you with are questions that really that dont have anything to do with the concepts studied in his sellout it seems he just wants to know if read it not if you understand it thumbs down
3581,John  Everitt,the class gets extremely boring but he change the material although he could make the class more lively a funny man and i really enjoy his classes when i fallen asleep
3582,John  Everitt,what a horrible prof why do you even go to can learn all you need to know in his sell out and the book his tests are posted so you really need to go to class his quizzes are dumb and are on useless crap u would usually skip over nvr take him
3583,John  Everitt,the idea of paying for classes is to have something contributed by the lecture he does not really say anything you cannot read in the well prepared reader and text so no point of going to class aside from seeing slides the class size was large so no discussion or questions a reader
3584,John  Everitt,he is awesome
3585,John  Everitt,all who says that he is hard should not be in university
3586,John  Everitt,one of the best teachers ever had i doubt forget him anytime soon
3587,John  Everitt,nice but impossible
3588,John  Everitt,lectures tend to get boring after a lot of listening is a lot of reading for the course is easy class if put in the time
3589,John  Everitt,needs to organize better funny and fairly interesting
3590,John  Everitt,not too hard but can get boring after a while focuses mostly on what he knows
3591,John  Everitt,like sitting in on family vacation slides but his vacations insted of relatives
3592,C  Wolfe,an excellent professor extremely strict and the majority of his testes are extremely challenging take him only if serious about biology
3593,C  Wolfe,terrible teacher dont recommend to anyone
3594,C  Wolfe,knows his stuff i think anybody can argue with that but i really enjoy his class lectures were fine but i really do believe the tests were very poorly written and failed to really capture how well a student knew the material take him again if at all possible
3595,C  Wolfe,this guy sucks i know biology and i got a d am currently retaking it with flores and i got an a on the first test i recommend taking it with flores straight forward supposedly we are getting a new bio prof wolfe was let go who knows how they will be though they could suck just as much as wolfe if not worse
3596,C  Wolfe,not a very good professor here are the high points lazy often used old outdated powerpoints tests frustrating at best i studied hours for one made a b studied three hours for another and made an a his exams do not test the concepts taught in lecture and the book one of the worst professors i have had science or otherwise
3597,C  Wolfe,a great biology teacher his notes are helpful if you actually study them this is college not highschool so supposed to put in effort to get a good grade i only went over his notes read the chapters and did the online quizzes and made a great grade in the class if you like studying or reading i suggest you switch majors
3598,C  Wolfe,dr wolfe basically read word for word from his notes most of the learning had to be done on your own attendance was mandatory considering you are the one paying for your class it should not be up to him if you show up or not the only person affected is you i showed the entire semester but it did not help me
3599,C  Wolfe,great teacher i care what anyone says his exams are hard when came straight from high school where everyone is spoonfed not hard when you take a couple hours to read and understand the material that what supposed to be doing anyway if majoring in biology
3600,C  Wolfe,this class is very hard the professor just makes a power point from the book and reads it to the class the lecture is very broad and the test are very specific i would not recommend anyone to take his biology class it is worthless to do good in the class you have to read and understand every word in the book
3601,C  Wolfe,the way that he teaches really does not help the students at all the only thing that he did was make a power point of the chapter in the book then read it off the screen there was really no explaining of the material that actually helped he hardly ever interacted with students either i could have learned as much by only looking at the book
3602,C  Wolfe,maybe dr wolfe has changed this semester but i think incredibly clear in his lectures and his test are easy as long as you study hard for them taking credit hours this semester and i still managed to get a on his first exam take him learn a lot
3603,C  Wolfe,umm for the comment below this one i think you have the wroong teacher buddy nice try though
3604,C  Wolfe,yeah he is hot but he is a fresh college grad and thinks he is the stuff and thinks he knows everything and thinks we are graduate students or something to hard and to fast
3605,C  Wolfe,worse professor i have had yet just reads the slides if you ask for explanation only makes you more confused and than spends half class talking about mushrooms tests are completely irrelevant to notes know how he comes up with some wuestions but he has a nice personality
3606,C  Wolfe,all these young bio students complaining about basic general bio haha poor kids wait til you have to take the real bio classes if you cant handle it now i suggest switching majors it get any easier and neither do the teachers
3607,C  Wolfe,not a good professor at all yah it is college but just ridiculous test are irrelevant to half the stuff he talks about in lecture he know how to teach at all take someone else
3608,C  Wolfe,if this is college then quit about having to study you babies
3609,C  Wolfe,every nerd who says this is college blah blah blah talking about the teacher everyone knows college is hard so stick to the point wolfe the best
3610,C  Wolfe,this is my third biology class with dr wolfe with an a in all three classes i think he is an excellent teacher very straightforward and willing to answer any questions you have even outside of class of course you have to study and pay attention welcome to the real world this is college not grade
3611,C  Wolfe,not as bad as below that was too harsh needs a new approch for the class though i had a tough schedule last semester and he was my only c grade
3612,Jessica  Hartos,she reminds me of chris rock her crude humor will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what she will say next this class is everything you wanted your tenth grade health class to be like very easy b if you show up you might not like her if you are easily offended or are uber sensative
3613,Jessica  Hartos,be warned hartos has some very crude raw humor but i personally laughed like crazy every class she taught but the work is boring a tedious and she has a strict absence policy also no curve and half the time she sends her to teach for her but just give a little effort and an a or b is no problem
3614,Jessica  Hartos,very easy take notes and pass funny easy professor
3615,Jessica  Hartos,great class i made a b but i could have made an a if i would have put forth a little more effort shes fun
3616,Jessica  Hartos,easy a if you pay attention crazy professor show up for class half the time assignments are easy all or none credit basically tests can be a little tricky if you read the book but all the extra credit makes up for that overall easy class just weird teacher
3617,Jessica  Hartos,whoever said that she doesnt give extra credit must have been in the wrong class i got a d on the test and still got an easy a there was the chance for over extra easy points troughout the semester she is hilarious and will say just about anything i would definitely recommend taking her
3618,Jessica  Hartos,this woman is a little crazy but in a good way she gives lots of extra credit for group work outlines and jeopardy tests are fair just be sure to read the book as well take her for lbst credit its a pretty easy a
3619,Jessica  Hartos,hard tests but makes class fun cool teacher
3620,Jessica  Hartos,i think she is hilarious and class is never dull if you read the chapters and study you will d fine in her class and if you need help do no hesitate to ask the conceptual questions at the end of the chapters are a big help on the tests
3621,Jessica  Hartos,all we do is take notes she gives no extra credit and tests are very hard you can study all you want but not going to help on the tests take her
3622,Jessica  Hartos,not the fairest grader in the whole world but what professor is she is young always good and has a relatively laid back and sarcastic teaching style which i thoroughly enjoy
3623,Todd  Feil,he is a good professor who is not a difficult grader he wants students to do well in the class and gives tests that reflect the class material sometimes is a little all over the place during lecture but overall pretty clear and easy to undertsand
3624,Todd  Feil,i thought he was a very helpful teacher actually teaches and writes notes in class unlike westmoreland who expects you to learn it all on your own helpful and nice if you go in for extra help if you do the homework and keep up with the work you will do well
3625,Todd  Feil,the thing is he does not grade fairly not a fan of partial credit not shocked anymore to see or on questions where i clearly have a halfdecent grasp on it he is very picky and uncompromising i seriously had the feeling that he often want me to do well with any other prof that b would definitely be a solid a
3626,Todd  Feil,feil is an excellent teacher though his tests are pretty tough he explains problems very clearly
3627,Todd  Feil,good prof helpful
3628,Todd  Feil,good guy taught well decent tests
3629,Todd  Feil,was not very consistent had to write a chapter of logic proof and mine was the only critiqued in front of the entire class not very helpful as an advisor
3630,Todd  Feil,wow is he hard but very good
3631,Matthew  Neal,i hated math until i took dr calc i class then i took his calc ii and he convinced me to be a math major extremely grateful to dr neal for making me feel so confident in myself very caring and notices when something is wrong with a student
3632,Matthew  Neal,hard i had to take it for my major though
3633,Matthew  Neal,dr neal is a very hard very nice teacher he is also one of my favorite people alive he is dedicated to the students and cares about them to the fullest he is always always open to emails meetings of any he is a very tough teacher however and be prepared to be challenged completely
3634,Matthew  Neal,great guy kinda awkward and really hard he is way too smart to be teaching an intro class he cannot connect with normal people
3635,Matthew  Neal,great professor crazy hard
3636,Matthew  Neal,really fun to have a class with but the homework in proof techniques is extremely difficult it balances out in the end if you enjoy a challenge and you already have a firm grasp on calculus take his classes
3637,Matthew  Neal,dr neal reminds me why i love math he makes sure you truly understand the material he has the best nerdy jokes too
3638,Matthew  Neal,great professor hilarious in a nerdy way very hard class but you learn a lot
3639,Matthew  Neal,funny in a very adorable dorky way sometimes random notes can be difficult to follow assigns a ton of homework and while none of ever due i always felt bad knowing i had several hundred no joke calc problems i should be working on tests are hard
3640,Matthew  Neal,i thought he was a good teacher he explains stuff really well and is available to help
3641,Matthew  Neal,the best math teacher ever had he is so good at explaining things really easy to understand what talking about
3642,Matthew  Neal,great guy funny in his own nerdy way extremely awkward but seriously kind you have to work hard for his class not easy has plenty of homework but if you work get what you want
3643,Matthew  Neal,dr neal was very funny he is sorta awkward and nerdy but in a good way i enjoyed his class becasue he was funny to be around but he a very good teacher i had a very strong calc backround and still had no freaking clue what he was ever talking about
3644,Matthew  Neal,humorous makes calc worth going to always willing to help does assign lots of homework but practice makes perfect so just do it
3645,Matthew  Neal,dr neal is a great teacher he gives a lot of homework and does let you out late but he is always willing to help he is very enthusiastic about what he does and is just such an awesome and funny person
3646,Matthew  Neal,agree with previous comments seems cold at first but then he warms up to you and starts joking about things always lets you out of class a few minutes late at times he can be unclear about material but willing to help you understand it
3647,Matthew  Neal,dr neal is so awesome he seems a little cold at first but after a while you warm up to him he is so awesome just sit in the front row and joke around with him he is very personal
3648,Matthew  Neal,not a good teacher and holds you late every freaking class period the man is nice and a little awkward but is only good at teaching one on one he gets too nervous in class to teach
3649,Matthew  Neal,great man and great teacher if you think that he is easy though you probably have only taken calc i with him and not fourier analysisand you suck at math
3650,Matthew  Neal,for a calc class it was very easy if you think hard then just bad at math study a little bit helpful and lenient when need be
3651,Larice  Brown,she is a good prof she def wants to help you if u are willing to try she will do what she can to help you do well her tests are fair and if you do the reading you know what is going on she will like you and appercaites a hard worker
3652,Larice  Brown,no comments
3653,Larice  Brown,lariece is a really smart woman who knows how to relay info to others but she seems a little impersonal tests are kinda hard because all of the questions are openended there really a whole lot of work on syllabus either
3654,Larice  Brown,great professor very willing to help do the reading and you will do fine very fair not a lot of work except for reading a chapter a week and tests tests are hard but fair very nice fair professor also good for nonmajors
3655,Larice  Brown,hard quizzes easy tests easy exam
3656,Larice  Brown,prof brown is really good at what she does thorough always helpful and cheerful def take a class with her
3657,Larice  Brown,shes nice
3658,Larice  Brown,no comments
3659,John  Gallaher,dr gallaher is a fantastic teacher and truly cares about the success of his students he gives amazing examples and uses many anecdotes in class in order to help students understand the material he is most definitely the best english teacher met in my collegiate career and glad i had a chance to take comp with him
3660,John  Gallaher,this class was amazing its not your usual or page writing course he makes things very engaging and different we pretty much never used the book and the writing assignments were super easy also we practically never stayed the whole class time
3661,John  Gallaher,it was a very easy class all we did was write a couple papers and talk about the book yet i still left feeling like i had learned something it was not what i expected for accelerated composition highly recommended
3662,John  Gallaher,take this class and this professor no standards no accountability no guidelines easiest a i ever got only a take the class durin yur hardest term cake
3663,John  Gallaher,i had dr gallaher for creative writing poetry and he is awesome to have as a teacher really laid back and he made the class really fun and i always looked forward to it and went to every class though he care about attendance i liked him so much i even made him my advisor definitely would recommend any of his creative writing courses
3664,John  Gallaher,he is an awesome teacher very easy class and easy to talk to he makes learning fun and an overall great teacher i recommend taking him if you can you only have to right papers all semester with a length of pages
3665,John  Gallaher,a great guy and the tests are very easy willing to help you out alot
3666,John  Gallaher,this guy is crazy fun he is really funny and i look forward to his class every day he seriously cracks me up also a good teacher he presents things in way that makes you think differently at them bring your book just go over the chapters homework is pretty easy lots of in class discussions i love his class you will too
3667,John  Gallaher,yes john is a fun teacher and a great guy to talk to however attendance is a huge issuenot his the class he hold his students accountable for attendance in his upper level classes so a lot of times class is pointless you could attend every day and get the same grade as a person who came the first and last day
3668,John  Gallaher,not a fan the freewilled nature of the professor is liberating and for that i commend however that strength is the seed of his destruction he offers hardly any challenge for the course and is evident he taking it seriously better off with other professors
3669,John  Gallaher,amazing erudite inspirational
3670,John  Gallaher,i had so much fun in this class i looked forward to attending every day he really made the class interesting and funny was also very good about working with the class on due dates and helping with papers great teacher
3671,John  Gallaher,gallaher is my favorite teacher i had my first year at northwest he makes class fun and entertaining with his many jokes
3672,John  Gallaher,john is by far the best professor had at northwest not like all the other english department teachers who bore you with pointless material that you even understand he makes the class fun and worth your time
3673,John  Gallaher,he tries constantly to not make the class boring or like basic book classes he loves hearing student opinons because they give a different outlook to it i recommend it to anyone especially if you like taking boring regular literature classes
3674,John  Gallaher,awsome and entertaining just stick to a certain schedule or course outline he tries to get you understand and likes to hear his students opinion on the literature
3675,John  Gallaher,every northwest student should find a way to take a class with him at least once
3676,John  Gallaher,no comments
3677,John  Gallaher,funny guy take this class too seriously also grade too hard just make sure you put a lot of feeling into your essays the papers are easy all you have to do is write about yourself no research required recommened him definitely
3678,John  Gallaher,pretty cool keeps things to the point mostly wanders around a bit but ok funny take himself too serious
3679,Anthony  Stewart,this class african american lit was my favorite class of my university career he challenged us to think about racially heavy topics this is a very good thing for people to do we ignore race far too often the sentiment usually goes we all know racism is bad so what else do we need to talk about he also chose wonderful texts
3680,Anthony  Stewart,the readings were really interesting and obviously a very smart guy intimidating at times and after taking numerous english classes he is most definately the hardest marker that encountered
3681,Anthony  Stewart,absolutely amazing one of the best teachers had in my lifetime
3682,Anthony  Stewart,i found this class challenging and enlightening dr.stewart is an animated lecturer who is passionate about his work i found him a little intimidating but he was always helpful when i went to see him i loved the readings highly recommended
3683,Anthony  Stewart,found this class irritating everyday he would tell us to read something and then the next day he would make us discuss it exam was hell he wanted you to memorize specific nonimportant quotations it seemed found him arrogant but i doubt he has great analytical skills which i picked up in the class too much content on race issues for me
3684,Anthony  Stewart,very approachable very funny be prepared for a lot of discussions
3685,Anthony  Stewart,no comments
3686,Anthony  Stewart,he is a terrible professor some girls think he is hot while some guys think he is cool however he is a rigid marker a boring lecturer and a cranky person as if he gets off on trying to strike fear into some of his students
3687,Anthony  Stewart,fascinating lectures great material and an incredibly smart man hard as hell but he is generous with extensions beware the final exam
3688,Anthony  Stewart,i found his lectures clear although i found that i could teach the material to myself better this professor took me before the senate on plagiarism charges which i was innocent of and he ignored me as a student after the allegation which was extremely stubborn of him he has a rep for doing watch out i still thought he was a good prof thou
3689,Anthony  Stewart,so glad i got prof stewart for my short story class he was a fun and interesting teacher with a wellstructured class and fantastic lectures not shy about his own opinions but he encourages opposition from his students as well definitely looking up his other classes to take in future
3690,Anthony  Stewart,anthony is one mean shut your mouth about anthony and we can dig it
3691,Anthony  Stewart,very and overal i felt like i learned very little from the course.every class he would let students rant on about how each story related to their lifegroup therapyesque gag i only marginally disliked him until i had medical problems and he accused me of lying to him not being a serious student.seemed like nice guy but an assh
3692,Anthony  Stewart,shortstoryi understand how people think pompus and arrogant but that made me like him even more i found him funny rather than rude made the class more like discussion period rather than just a regular lecture this was one of my fav classes i found him helpful he gave me good direction for my paper exam was more difficult than i expecte
3693,Anthony  Stewart,story also had for brit lit a genuinely fair marker many comments here say but there are definitely harder markers in the engl dept has a superficial semipomposity yes but lectures and demands are clear is generally helpful and encourages student creativity really one of the better english professors
3694,Anthony  Stewart,i hope he reads this one day and knows that straight up the guy almost ruined my first year with all these professors trying to make u feel welcome here is dr stewart and his condescending remarks and attitude not a good person and not a good teacher i tried to tell him i was struggling he have cared less a real egomaniac and jer
3695,Anthony  Stewart,i had dr stewart in an honours seminar a couple of years ago one of the worst professors that i had the misfortune of encountering at dal pompous egotistical inflexible andunfortunatelynot that good that being said if willing to follow his lead and you love critical theory probably be fine
3696,Anthony  Stewart,not only is dr anthony stewart an unreasonable professor but the man is simply put a pompous ass he stalks over his lectures like some intellectual giant when in reality he is just another runofthemill professor who takes himself too seriously his classes are always filled with racial overtones as well and constantly remind you
3697,Anthony  Stewart,best marge simpson impression ever great prof cares about students funny genius
3698,Anthony  Stewart,awesome prof funny smart and kind really hard marker brutal exam but worth it because his lectures are great i skip once
3699,Derek  Eberts,my worst grade for a course so far in university i think the annoying overuse of textbook material that makes the class hard very frustrating when all of your marks come from exams based only on textbook material and there are no assignments or lab work his slideshow notes are terrible they contain only words and no explanations
3700,Derek  Eberts,horrible professor tests are irrelevant to material discussed in class and picks oneliners from the textbook that important would not discuss this course
3701,Derek  Eberts,needs to be more things marked not just tests
3702,Derek  Eberts,worst prof terrible sexist prof makes jokes or comments and then spends mins explaining he mean it to be sexiest or racist lectures suck all he talks about is his life and things from toronto has biased opinions that he will share tests are complete bs puts stuff on there never discussed you have to read every word in text
3703,Derek  Eberts,i was not a fan of human geography however urban geography was my favorite class was very interesting and he used multiple relevant examples i would definitely take another class in the level with dr eberts
3704,Derek  Eberts,worst class i have taken at bu professor not engaging and tests were not relevant to exams most test questions were insignificant facts etc sitting through the minute class is extremely boring hardly worth attending since the lectures barely reflect the tests very disappointing
3705,Derek  Eberts,terrible prof worst class ever had there was no point in attending class as he never talked about anything related to the course loses track of what he is saying and frequently has to read out of textbook or his notes refers too much to toronto area where he went to school tests are b.s noone ever knew what to study students beware
3706,Derek  Eberts,this class was a lot of fun to attend the lecture notes were a little confusing at times overall i would recommend it to anyone
3707,Derek  Eberts,very helpful if you have questions
3708,Derek  Eberts,inredibly boring
3709,Derek  Eberts,unbelievable left class for a dentist appointment and expected us to sit around and wait for over an hour for him to get back
3710,Derek  Eberts,he talks about such b.s sometimes and things that relevent to the class his tests are aweful just make sure you read the textbook
3711,Derek  Eberts,i found dr eberts to a very helpful although at first he may seem hard to approach once you talk to him he is fine his second and third year classes are much better than the first year ones as he is more interested in the subject he is teaching
3712,Derek  Eberts,class lectures somewhat interesting but mostly dull far too much focus on assignments marked hard and often accompanied with comments exams quite difficult and adequately represent material covered
3713,Derek  Eberts,somewhat boring but has his random funny times which you dont expect and hes super nice to talk to you learn a lot in this class and the are really easy good class overall
3714,Derek  Eberts,what a useless man worst classes ever very dry lecture test are impossible plus you have to deal with his snide little comments when you recieve assignments back avoid his classes at all costs
3715,Derek  Eberts,the worst prof rude not helpful arrogant a complete ass
3716,Derek  Eberts,i think eberts is really knowledgeable but not very approachable his tests arent bad but he doesnt really help you out at all with notes since he basically just talks about pictures i also dont like his comments about people leaving his class what if an emergency and why do you care its not your problem if they dont wanna learn
3717,Derek  Eberts,an okay guy with an interesting lecture but on tests he picks the tiniest detail to test you on plus there was a midterm and a final with that
3718,Derek  Eberts,knew his stuff and made the class interesting not very approachable
3719,Ron  Cameron,i love ron cameron i take a class with him every year my favorite professor learned so much from him and i get that idiosyncratic but you will learn from him even if you like him but hilarious and crazy and great
3720,Ron  Cameron,he is the best person ever he is a genius totally energetic and all over the place and totally devoted to teaching also one of the funniest people on campus and definitely has the biggest personality on campus i love him and have taken two classes with him and because of him going to be a religion major learned so much from him
3721,Ron  Cameron,ron cameron is the most amazing professor ever had he is an incredible lecturer and he is one of the leading experts in his field he runs around the room acts things out you can tell extremely passionate about what teaching also hilarious be sure to take a class with hime while at wesleyan
3722,Ron  Cameron,he is one of the smartest proffesors on campus because of the fact he has taught this class for around decades his grading however is ridiculous and i assure you that you will get no higher than a b do not make the mistake i did by taking this class gpa killer
3723,Ron  Cameron,horrible teacher he seems passionate but it is about nothing hard to understand i stand one and a half hours in a class with him worst lecturer ever had he outright said christianity and every faith is beautiful but wrong so derogatory
3724,Ron  Cameron,best teacher had a wesleyan his enthusiasm for the subject was infectious i went into the class thinking i was going to drop it because the first reading seemed dense but he manages it to make it interesting and enjoyable as long as you do the reading and take advantage of office hours when something is unclear be fine
3725,Ron  Cameron,the man really interesting lectures and reading got me interested in studying religion
3726,Ron  Cameron,professor cameron is a really enthusiastic guy he is so well learned and his lectures are never boring he really knows his stuff he is a really tough grader though i would get a on his exam and he told me i did extremely well.i consider a an extremely good grade but he does focus on the topics he emphasized n on the exam
3727,Ron  Cameron,prof enthusiastic interest in teaching and in class materials makes classes enjoyable and fantastic for learning
3728,Ron  Cameron,amazing take his class he is crazy and a hard grader but good for the mind and really teaches a fascinating class
3729,Ron  Cameron,honestly he is one of the most eloquent men i have ever heard speak however it proves to be hard for him to stay on track lectures are extremely hard to follow due to his presentation in other words so smart he needs to hold it back a little bit he is very emphatic about the new testament and extremely stringent with grading
3730,Ron  Cameron,really really awesome so so smart and he presents a very interesting view of the new testament a lot of work but really worth it i learned so much and he teaching method including interesting uses of the word is very engaging
3731,Ron  Cameron,no comments
3732,Ron  Cameron,i took him years ago and my biggest regret was not taking more courses with him yes a funny accent and at times goes on a bit but brilliant passionate and provoking
3733,Ron  Cameron,get past the elmer fudd accent and find one of the best teachers wes has to offer truly loves his subject and communicates his enthusiasm to his students
3734,Ron  Cameron,he rules totally worth it
3735,Ron  Cameron,completely awesome and engaging although sometimes so hopped up on caffine it seems like the only one who has any idea what talking about
3736,Rachel  Hall,dr hall is a professor that you should avoid i went to her for help and constantly wanted to improve in her class but she care and help me she is very smart but not so good at getting the info across take someone else trust me
3737,Rachel  Hall,if looking to take hall for sounding numbers avoid this class yes easy but learned absolutely nothing longest lectures ever and they make no sense she gives quizzes every thursday i personally hated this class because i had no interest in taking a music class you have to read her notes and she gives a crap ton of homework
3738,Rachel  Hall,dr hall is a genuinely nice professor she will let you make up quizzes and homework with some leniency homework and quizzes are assigned bimonthly without the use of a syllabus calendar rachel will say at any rate about times per class very hard to wake up for this class if its at
3739,Rachel  Hall,take symmetry most pointless and confusing class ever taken not a bad professor but the subject is just very confusing and abstract it was a very awkward class she will assign homework that make any sense mainly because the textbook makes no sense i would not recommend anyone taking this class
3740,Rachel  Hall,terrible professor does not know how to teach would not recommend taking her unless math is your strength if taken calculus before its very easy but still rough to sit through
3741,Rachel  Hall,professor hall is very nice and helpful but her class can get boring at times all the homework is on the syllabus and usually due once every other week when homework is due you have a quiz sometimes she gets confusing but as long as you keep up with the work get a b will have to work a little bit for an a
3742,Rachel  Hall,tests too bad gives study guides for every one final was easy as long as you show up and take good notes as well as complete the study guides you will get a good grade in the class
3743,Rachel  Hall,she is such a hard grader and i would never ever want to take a class with her again the tests also rarely make sense and the homework follow the noteslecture at all
3744,Rachel  Hall,she is more interested in her music math classes than in this one for sure but overall is a good teacher if you get something the first time reteach it to you in a different way in office hours works with all types of learners must attend class if want help skip if you want but expect her to help you if stuck
3745,Rachel  Hall,this class was pretty difficult and dr hall was not much help the text book is impossible to understand dr hall is very smart but have any people skills at all even with that if you study hard you can still get a good grade
3746,Rachel  Hall,i was in dr class for two semesters of excursions got into a lot of subject matter you classify as math call it easy but call it hard either although usually one hard test per semester but the quizzes every friday can pull up your grade
3747,Rachel  Hall,great teacher gives an easy quiz every class period that is only or questions and she goes over it directly before you take it gives weeks to complete hw assignments very helpful easy
3748,Rachel  Hall,the class is really boring and she is no help at all i went to her office a few times and that was just a waste of time the final project is kind of interesting tests too bad if you knew your stuff
3749,Rachel  Hall,good teacher like a grownup teenager in a math genius body games almost every week
3750,Rachel  Hall,hard class quizes once a week she is super smart when it comes to math but always know how to teach it well recommend if you did not have calc before
3751,Rachel  Hall,great professor tough material you will get from her class what you put into it as long as you show her effort she will do her best to help you
3752,Rachel  Hall,nice person but perhaps on a different intellectual level at times lectures can be hard to understand she will always help you if you ask and not too hard on due dates can grade hard at times
3753,Rachel  Hall,she is one of the best profs at sju
3754,Rachel  Hall,shes nice and tried to make class fun sometimes but pretty much didnt teach anything although she tried she knows what shes talking about but didnt know how to teach it we pretty much had to teach ourselves calc i wouldnt recommend
3755,Rachel  Hall,just say no she is horrible
3756,Lorelle  Semley,worst class my first semester of freshman year she is very disorganized her lectures are all over the place so it is hard to take notes which also makes it hard to study for her exams her grading criteria and prompts are unclear leaving you with little to no idea on how to do for tests do not recommend
3757,Lorelle  Semley,she assigns a lot of readings but you can get by without doing them as long as you take notes in class harsh grader on papers she give many guidelines then corrects aspects that she did not say were necessary very disorganized lost our midterms and did not handle it well i do not recommend taking this class
3758,Lorelle  Semley,i had her for african history which was good but if you can get her for a smaller seminar she is fantastic laid back extremely intelligent and very responsive and really tries to help if you have questions not always easy but fair great prof
3759,Lorelle  Semley,
3760,Lorelle  Semley,the class itself was difficult and the i had a hard time in trying to understand what the professor wanted to convey
3761,Lorelle  Semley,her class was interesting and well structured but is covering a very difficult subject matter so it was understandably difficult at times extremely nice and knowledgeable woman
3762,Lorelle  Semley,nice lady lectures are dull and pretty repetitive it hard to keep track of terms because she doesnt go in chronological order she grades pretty hard and points out very trivial mistakes but gives flexibility with paper writing
3763,Lorelle  Semley,lorelle semley is incredible and extremely knowledgeable very engaging the class was very enjoyable and a hell of a learning experience very harsh grader though take her classes when she returns from sabbatical in the fall of
3764,Lorelle  Semley,the class was terribly boring only other students and it was a seminar so poorly run with no guidance from the professor it was a pretty bad class especially considering i was so excited to take it
3765,Lorelle  Semley,no comments
3766,Lorelle  Semley,this class has all the potential to be interesting but it her lectures come right from the reading assignments and very engaging sometimes it feels like she know her stuff
3767,Theodore  Zeman,man can he talk i would often find myself zoning out he mostly just reads directly from the book for the entire class period without showing any visuals or anything interesting one redeeming quality is that he is extremely funny and injects his humor throughout your entire grade is dependent on the two tests midterm and final grades
3768,Theodore  Zeman,he is an excellent professor he knows the material he is teaching i enjoyed his class because he tried to connect the past and the current events he does his best to make the class interesting and also is very kind and tries always to help his students i only had midterm papers and final take him he is a very nice professor
3769,Theodore  Zeman,he gives a lot of papers and is vague on the material for the midterm and final he gives you six essay topics to memorize but only two are on the test extremely stressful
3770,Theodore  Zeman,this guy loves to hear himself talk from the time class starts until the very end talking everything he says comes right from the book the tests are outrageous and the papers are incredibly hard a nice enough guy but a horrible instructor
3771,Theodore  Zeman,a nice guy but his teaching style is extremely boring this class was one night a week three hours and he give any breaks which be so bad if he mixed things up a bit the three papers we had for the class were on topics that only got touched on the week before the due date tough grader take a class with him again
3772,Theodore  Zeman,like his teaching style no powerpoint straight from the book not specific of what he wants in a paper lectures are long and mundane makes you wanna go to sleep gets distracted easily
3773,Theodore  Zeman,class is not an easy a but its not horrible theres weekly papers two tests and a final exam the tests consist of mc and essay he hands out potential essay questions a week in advance mc choice questions are difficult but writing a decent essay is enough to make up for that overall he is a really nice prof even though the class is hard
3774,Theodore  Zeman,do not take him papers every single friday on what we talked about in class you have to fit every reading in the paper somewhere and theres at least readings its awful at least reading for each class gives no help even if you ask tests are impossible find a different teacher if you are taking this class
3775,Theodore  Zeman,never take this man paper every friday tests are impossible class averages about a each test curve grades the papers unfairly and is very unclear as to what will be on the test
3776,Theodore  Zeman,take this class so much reading assigned for each class and a paper due every friday a few tests with mc on very minute details and an essay on each test
3777,Theodore  Zeman,the class itself is easy considering that there are only two tests and dr zeman gives you study guides although they are long that lay out wordforword exactly what you have to know are absolutely mandatory but zeman is super friendly and lays out everything clearly and is very receptive to questions
3778,Theodore  Zeman,very interesting class tests were challenging but if you study hard do fine only drawback is that there were six required books for american military and war either way take it again
3779,Theodore  Zeman,a good teacher class is somewhat boring just listening to his notes but the class is easy we only had one paper three exams the exams are kind of hard but he makes it very clear what you need to know im taking him again next semester because i really liked the class
3780,Theodore  Zeman,funny guy he really knows his stuff if you read the textbook you will be fine for the tests make flash cards and do the essays before hand and see him during office hours he will give you answers and help for the tests very laid back wait to take him again
3781,Theodore  Zeman,he is a super nice guy and loves history but class is very hard used to be that he had quizzes once a week which were a pain but the tests were impossible so at least you could count on them to help you got rid of quizzes so now just the impossible tests very hard for a ger i would recommend someone else
3782,Theodore  Zeman,a good guy genuinely no more quizzes and really difficult exams but he wants you to do well so if you see him he is an extraordinary resource he will go out of his way to make sure you are doing well if you just show you care you dont have to read the book but it does help a lot he goes over everything in class id take him again
3783,Theodore  Zeman,to everyone considering taking him heres a warning.hes totally changed his style no more quizzes or matching on the tests the tests are all fillin and he gives no specificity on who to concentrate on so u have to know who over people are for a test on top of at least essays which he grades hard cool dude but be cautious
3784,Theodore  Zeman,very hard class was average score on tests give quizes anymore and you have to know all the people from the text nice teacher though
3785,Theodore  Zeman,zeman is the man take him tests make up percent of your grade and the questions on the test are directly off the quizzes plus he gives you the essays ahead of time the bad quiz a wk is a major pain only of avg tho paper is nearly impossible to write but he grades it easily lowest grade was a youll prob get a b

3808,Julie  Giles,easy she was hyped on coffee all year but was extremely easy she related everything to students
3809,Julie  Giles,if you do well in her class is because you missed too many a great professor
3810,Julie  Giles,she is a really nice teacher she is very devoted and explains everything clearly
3811,Julie  Giles,she is one of the best professors at devry she is helpful and very clear go to all classes and do all homework she covers a lot of material in one day also be afraid to ask questions
3812,Julie  Giles,no no no at all
3813,Julie  Giles,if you attend class and do homework all comes easy except the final that was hard
3814,Julie  Giles,no comments
3815,Julie  Giles,good teacher if you need this class and want to succeed take her as your teacher
3816,Julie  Giles,she is a very nice professor if you do not understand a concept all you have to do is ask and she will go over it until you grasp the concept i wish she taught more courses than she does i would recommend her to anyone
3817,Julie  Giles,this woman does not allow extenuating circumstances to occur during the term she does not help one bit in fact i was never led to believe i was doing poorly in the class i found out when i recieved an f on my report card she is an ice q
3818,Tom  Sill,keep up on the textbook reading if you keep up with the reading and make the weekly note sheets for the exams you will ace this class if you procrastinate and try to do all the reading the weekend before the exam you will be screwed
3819,Tom  Sill,you will have homework every day and his tests are extremely hard but he curves grades generously and is very clear about what you need to do to get an a good class learn a lot and probably end up with an okay grade
3820,Tom  Sill,great guy not such a great class if you are not good at math you are screwed this is a teacher who knows his stuff so when it comes to teaching there is not a lot of variety in explanations can be hard to follow
3821,Tom  Sill,amazing teacher if you are willing to put in the time he goes out of his way to make sure every student understands can be extremely creative in his teaching methods student needs to be responsible or he will not keep up
3822,Tom  Sill,he definitely has a passion for the spiritual side but totally lacks teaching skills i took him for computer application and he teach anything took him for nonprofit and the students taught the class he gets paid well for not teaching much
3823,Tom  Sill,has a greater passion for outreach than finance
3824,Craig  Estep,he is a great guy and wonderful with glee however his conducting leaves more to be desired
3825,Craig  Estep,omg wonderful prof eveyone sould take glee club even if they sing coach will help you discover your inner voice and he will help you make it beautiful
3826,Craig  Estep,awesome i love coach so much i you dont like to sing after this class you will love it so wonderful
3827,Craig  Estep,wonderful prof well actually called coach but who cares the class is easy if you work on the music and we get to go to new york and sing in carnegie hall too

3836,Roderick  McGinn,terrible teacher he sells you his book for more than it is worth then his lectures and notes are not adequate for his exams his tests are harder than the material he gives he is arrogant and insulting thinks he is the greatest gift to the field of geography
3837,Roderick  McGinn,took classes from him year people piss around and then get mad when they fail you have to show up and you have to pay attention the notes are all there but people use them his and year classes are amazing glacial geomorphology river mechanics and n.american weather systems are all fantastic classes
3838,Roderick  McGinn,what a mess i was injured while i was taking the class where i sit and asked for an exam deferal he told me to stand and write the exam rude avoid this guy
3839,Roderick  McGinn,he only seems like a very scary man as long as you attend lectures and make notes in your book his classes are a breeze a great prof once you get through his first year class
3840,Roderick  McGinn,interesting class yet so hard to learn because of the teaching methods probably the worst prof ever had although he may think his models are simplifications of reality they are just plain confusing can be quite ignorant as well i would suggest to avoid this class at all costs if mcginn is still the prof
3841,Roderick  McGinn,great
3842,Roderick  McGinn,thumbs down make sure you buy his textbook that he makes and sells himself or be prepared for a lousy mark
3843,Roderick  McGinn,no comments
3844,Roderick  McGinn,wow hard course to begin with but the lecture diagrams make it any easier
3845,Roderick  McGinn,no comments
3846,Roderick  McGinn,not for slackers gives you all the information that you need and expects you to learn it one of the craziest senses of humor on the faculty take his class but be prepared to pull your weight
3847,Roderick  McGinn,the guy know anything unless the text is right in front of him hardest class ever taken weird since an intro class
3848,Roderick  McGinn,mcginn is a very fair prof the course material is not the easiest but if you remember his dumb jokes it will help you at test time go to the tutorials if you want to make the grade
3849,Roderick  McGinn,makes geography simple
3850,Roderick  McGinn,loved it made tedious details in course very interesting and applicable good professor humorous
3851,Roderick  McGinn,impossible course no help just slides and lecture is very rude annoying and arrogant avoid like the plague if at all possible

3856,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,dr gubacs uses her class to present her work to up and coming teachers the class has no purpose she is very unorganized and the class was a hybrid and assignments are unclear she cares more about her outside stuff then her class i was extremely disappointed with the course she also loves to talk about how great she is
3857,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,best professor ever made class interesting and really enjoys teaching
3858,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,i took her class over the summer and it was hybrid it was so easy she is an awesome teacher and very fair on everything all the students had her before except me and they all knew her and loved her she definetly makes the class interesting and i would definetly recommend
3859,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,dr gubacs is a fantastic professor she is a great athlete and does a good job teaching and relating to the student very kind woman and i look forward to taking another course with her in the future
3860,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,dr gubacs is my hero and not even kidding i loved her class badminton fencing and tennis and i loved her as a professor she is extremely professional courteous fun i loved her drive and competitiveness and really taught us how to teach i would highly recommend dr gubacs as a professor taking her again in the fall
3861,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,gubacs rocks class was easy but sometimes boring just show up and do some work and you will do just fine she tries to help you as much as she can so just ask
3862,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,archery golf and track and field a great teacher very fun class had her in the summer weeks and it flew by just show up to class and work hard and you are guaranteed an a gubacs rules
3863,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,great professor very interested in all sports very competitive just dont be a primadona and show up and you are pretty much guaranteed an a class is also very fun and interesting p.s she loves to talk about the soccer league she is in so beware
3864,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,best teacher ever makes you work hard but it pays off in the end gubacs
3865,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,great teacher motivator talker advice giver just all around greatness i had her for all of my sports modules and i enjoyed every single minute and every single class a very competitive teacher and i know many people that like that about her but if going to be a phys ed major then u need to step up ure athletic skills before u think about taking her class she likes athletes not cheerleader
3866,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,she is great i learned tons from her she is always willing to help she is my favorite professor
3867,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,hot
3868,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,excellent professor always interested in her students and improving her teaching skills and ver very hot
3869,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,best teacher i have had so far in the phys ed dept
3870,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,great class
3871,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,awesome job this past semester i think i would have fun playing golf doing track and field and archery but i had a blast very nice to give us cool tshirts at the end too tests were fair and easy
3872,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,outstanding she may be tough but i think she helped me figure out why i wanted to teach phys ed.all you have to do is pay upin class pass the test and just show that you care about this major and you will be fine.she is tough but its to help you get ready for the real world
3873,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,awesome prof just participate athletically show interest help out and get an a
3874,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,it was a fun class and she is okay she just thinks she is a little better in some sports than she really is keep it cool doc you are not going to win all the time
3875,Klara  Gubacs-Collins,she is the bomb great teacher and competitor fun classes
3876,Tomoko  Deguchi,she is a great professor she is pretty gracious but does expect a lot from her students i would take her again for aural in a heartbeat
3877,Tomoko  Deguchi,i tried going to her office for help she asked me questions then i tried to answer them but got them wrong she then said i needed to get help um what i was there for she has a difficult language barrier no matter how much i did i could not pass who grades homework anymore that did nothing but have my grade go lower and lower
3878,Tomoko  Deguchi,absolutely brilliant professor she could probably write a music theory textbook herself if she busy teaching every class and doing research sometimes too brilliant to understand but always more than willing to help you and look over your projects as well also really really adorable fun class
3879,Tomoko  Deguchi,dr class is not easy because the subject music theory is not easy she is brilliant and an excellent teacher she takes time with students who understand most at wu sadly and holds lots of extra office hours i could not have made it through theory without dr deguchi
3880,Tomoko  Deguchi,really is not a process oriented teacher at all if you already know what questions to ask take her classes nice person who tries to help if needed but not a great teacher
3881,Tomoko  Deguchi,dr deguchi is really sweet and an amazing musician an okay professor her grading is fair and her accent is amusing but the textbook will be your greatest friend she bases her teaching solely on the book at times
3882,Tomoko  Deguchi,you can never appreciate deguchi until you have someone else she is always willing to help and the easiest theory techer here
3883,Tomoko  Deguchi,mrs deguchi is a very tough tough teacher you really have to work in her class to pass but she is very willing to help out students which makes a her a pretty good teacher in my eyes
3884,Tomoko  Deguchi,hard to understand at first but after being in her class a couple of days you start to translate well always really helpful if you ask she just expects you to apply yourself calls on people in class and laughs when answers wrong but funny and a good teacher
3885,Tomoko  Deguchi,sometimes you understand very well but she makes up for it with her hotness
3886,Tomoko  Deguchi,she does not teach class she reads the text book her suplements are total bs i wish she could speak and understood that sometimes we understand her she always plays the piano as lound and hard as she can
3887,Tomoko  Deguchi,hard class if you hate theory she does a good a good job of explaining things to you she always makes me laugh with her accent and how she pronounces words but a very time consuming class so have time on your hands for the projects
3888,Tomoko  Deguchi,there is a lot to learn in this class if you show up attendace policy is strict and the projects are time consuming not hard time consuming
3889,Tomoko  Deguchi,no comments
3890,Tomoko  Deguchi,no comments
3891,Anita  Girton,she makes clear at the start she uses a flipped teaching style in that students teach students and she guides it is quite literally that and with it being an intro class no one has any clue what teaching you learn everything on your own she teaches nothing and occasionally shows videos she stresses she is lazy and she sure is
3892,Anita  Girton,the first half of the semester is on book material and the second half is doing a confusing as hell group project it did not help that she missed so many days of class the tests are somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be good to go make sure to ask her questions outside of class because her instructions are often vague
3893,Anita  Girton,the course was pointless provided no insight into simulation due to her teaching style and like all of her classes she taught it like a management class and you learn nothing about the subject because she know anything about it this is the only class that directly involves simulation in the bgs major and it added nothing to my knowledge
3894,Anita  Girton,you essentially need to have your book and constantly read it in order to understand what is going on she lecture but has you become the teacher in the course and teach everyone else difficult to understand what is happening because she constantly switches between talking about the class and hypothetical scenarios without warning
3895,Anita  Girton,anita is a nice person but she generally has no idea what she is talking about and is usually completely unprepared for her lessons the book actually tries to show you the content of the course i have doubts if she has ever read it beware of her extreme problems with clarity and habits of assigning homework through email at random
3896,Anita  Girton,she has never once lectured or taught any material the entire class stupid reading quizzes every weekend all you do is show up to class she gives you a group presentation to prepare in minutes and you teach the class yourself she requires you too write ridiculous long papers for certain assignments a horrible level class
3897,Anita  Girton,she is clearly over her head and has no idea what she doing she talks to hear herself be friendly has no true industry insite that does not come out of a book she plays favorites and is straight up two faced never take courses or the gaming degree from this school
3898,Anita  Girton,has no real idea what she is teaching and has no industry insights to help the students grow into the job market complete waste of space
3899,Anita  Girton,all of the gaming classes she teaches and the modeling class are boring she actually teach you either do nothing work on projects or watch videos that teach if you are working on projects it is pointless because you have plenty of out of class time to get them done
3900,Anita  Girton,she is a very cheerful lady and extremely excited about what she does loves to hear herself talk and the class is more boring than peeling a potato plus she gives a ton of assignments good luck
3901,Anita  Girton,so easy and fun she loves what doing its a class on how to use a computer and different things on the web on class was spent discussing whether to buy a pc or a mac that was also one of our assignments so easy and helpful just do all your homework and get an a do whatever she can to help you awesome
3902,Anita  Girton,very nice and down to earth prof easy going and easy classes do the angel quizzes and do fine open book on the exams i turn in homework assignments and near the end of the semester i asked if i could turn them in for a grade and she allowed without any complication why all of them be this nice would take again
3903,Anita  Girton,my roommates said the way she teaches it now is a lot harder than before everyone did poorly on the case study we had to do i had a group that did not understand the material completely which help by the time she explained the material in full for teh section we had to hand it in people that went for help still recieved bad grades
3904,Anita  Girton,great professor knows her stuff has open office hours very nice brings in candy and stuff definitely recommended
3905,Anita  Girton,the class isnt easy its a level course but when i took the class she seemed like she was a little confused herself on what to teach always seemed like a spontaneous class
3906,Anita  Girton,loved the class
3907,Anita  Girton,dont even bother going to class and get an a if you know access well
3908,Anita  Girton,very nice professor pays attention to the students needs very helpful and interesting class
3909,Anita  Girton,good teacher very helpful if she herself is unclear about something she will check it out
3910,Anita  Girton,no comments
3911,Kelly  Kadera,she will unleash the beast if she catches you with any technology in your hand most difficult class i have ever experienced professor seems as though she hates her life and likes to take it out on innocent students lecture slides are irrelevant and she talks too quick to catch anything drop this class asap
3912,Kelly  Kadera,generic intro course lectures i found them interesting and useful for classes i have taken since then
3913,Kelly  Kadera,tests are hard not enough time to answers questions questions are irrelevant to anything they are random and no way anyone would know the correct answer take this class
3914,Kelly  Kadera,she really knows her stuff but her lecture slides very helpful offers extra credit quizzes a couple times throughout the semester so go to lectures
3915,Kelly  Kadera,her lectures were incredibly specific and too advanced for an introductory class she would wonder why no one was understand anything and the concepts were uninteresting in the way she presented them she seem to care about the intro class at all is only in it for her own research
3916,Kelly  Kadera,boring lectures allow technology in lecture or discussion offers random extra credit quizzes about four times during the semester for up to points so worth going to lecture the slides are online but they definitely do not have all the information you need to know
3917,Kelly  Kadera,she is an incredibly smart person but a terrible professor i had her for an introductory class but she acted as if we were supposed to already know everything she spent at least half the class rambling about nothing important and then wondered why nobody understood anything
3918,Kelly  Kadera,she let the class use technology to take notes but it matter as she provided the power point slides on icon all i had to do was print them off i recommend taking notes directly on the power point slides she provides for the class exams are over lectures and the textbook she explains everything in detail a lot of extra credit
3919,Kelly  Kadera,subtly sneaks her political views into lectures liberal extremely condescending says at least once a week oh too young to know who x is when x is a prominent politician or celebrity tries to hold our hands through lectures take notes on weirdobvious examples she rewords them and has them as a test question
3920,Kelly  Kadera,great professor little bit hard and there are many things to read but very intelligent and try really really hard to help students if you actively ask for help you will get an a not easy class but if you try you can get an a a range is quite wide as well she gives lots and lots of extra credits
3921,Kelly  Kadera,shes nothing but an arrogant airhead she loves listening to herself talk and acts surprised when no one follows the lecture
3922,Kelly  Kadera,test are arbitrary and difficult lectures are confusing boring and sporadic no curve and little extra credit avoid this professor at all costs
3923,Kelly  Kadera,professor knows her stuff but chooses not to share with class in an easy and understanding way off topic in lecture tests are sporadic and the class is overall confusing do not recommend with her
3924,Kelly  Kadera,not helpful off subject in lecture i would not recommend this class especially for a gen ed it could be interesting but this professor is horribly boring
3925,Kelly  Kadera,she says reading the textbook is mandatory but waste your money or time attend lectures and take notes and be prepared to answer the most arbitrary facts on the tests all in all i do not recommend taking this course with her as the instructor
3926,Kelly  Kadera,as a professor kelly was great her teaching style is fun and kept me interested the way the course was conducted was my struggle the first half of the course is heavy reading that is meant for someone who is an expert in the subject the books we read are much simpler in the second half class was mainly a lecture to confused faces
3927,Kelly  Kadera,horrible professor asks about extremely arbitrary things on tests she says read the textbook but honestly you have to know the random things that she decides do not take this class
3928,Kelly  Kadera,great professor very intelligent inspiring and truly cares about students gotta love her
3929,Kelly  Kadera,great professor very knowledgable in her field i took intro to international relations with her it was a hard class but if you actually go to lecture and read the textbook it bad she can be kind of jumpy with material sometimes but makes the content easy to understand lots of extra credit opportunities as well would recommend
3930,Kelly  Kadera,she knows her stuff but the tests are impossible lectures are boring and i find it hard to understand what teaching discussion help much either
3931,Gordon  McNorton,not a very friendly professor but his class is extremely easy hard to stay awake during the lectures but take his class for an easy a
3932,Gordon  McNorton,mcnorton tries hard to make a boring class fun he doesnt always answer questions clearly and sometimes doesnt even give you an answer at all but a very nice man
3933,Gordon  McNorton,not the greatest presenter kind of boring actually but you do learn good basic computer application skills he gives exams and a final along with a computer assignment from each software as well as a web page it was very easy to make an a
3934,Gordon  McNorton,knowledgable extremely helpful excellent class lectures labs can be difficult but you learn a lot from them
3935,Gordon  McNorton,really easy should take
3936,Elizabeth  Allen,no comments
3937,Elizabeth  Allen,a great teacher she is hard but fair and will push you to do your best
3938,Elizabeth  Allen,many people dislike her but i think she is helpful once you know what she looks for the class is annoying but she is as helpful as she can be
3939,Elizabeth  Allen,yeah this expletive deleted is evil she tried to get a friend of mine thrown out of school because of a miscited quote if i were any of you underclassmen contemplating taking her steer faarr away
3940,Elizabeth  Allen,this lady lost my last paper which i turned in on time and then gave me a zero on it
3941,Elizabeth  Allen,yo she gave me all on my papers if you take her your gonna have to work she works you with big essays and assignments i would take another teacher if i were you
3942,Elizabeth  Allen,focuses on immigrants the entire class and grades more on citations and mla style rather than content does not give anything higher than a c unless your very lucky
3943,Elizabeth  Allen,prof allen makes students do rough drafts but doesnt critique the drafts as she would the paper its pointless she has good class discussions but is infatuated with citations and a well written paper with citation mistakes usually gets a c
3944,Elizabeth  Allen,nice lady but not very successful or helpful in the teaching aspect
3945,Elizabeth  Allen,everyone said writing sem was suppose to be easier and more interesting because it relates to your major well that def isnt true with the expection of learning useless citations that you will never use in the business world her class was a waste
3946,Elizabeth  Allen,no comments
3947,Elizabeth  Allen,no one here is an english major here it seems she thinks otherwise take at least one letter grade off for what you think your paper should get every single word of a paper will be looked at with insane scrutiny avoid at all costs
3948,Elizabeth  Allen,you either get it or you basically the first grade you get it the grade always get i went to tutor after tutor and could not get more than a you miss any classes for any reason even one and drop your particapation grade
3949,Elizabeth  Allen,if you have her expect to get a grade better than a b on any of your papers and u better hope u have any family emergencies that you need to miss class for she failed my friend for missing class of a serious emergency
3950,Elizabeth  Allen,great proffessor i know what you slackers are talking about giving her negitive remarks there need to be more like her
3951,Elizabeth  Allen,had allen last sem elevator go to the top floor so she was replaced anything was better al knew her stuff offered help outside class very anal checks every citation forget to quote the if u
3952,Elizabeth  Allen,not open to students opinions very defensive when spoken against
3953,Elizabeth  Allen,worthless teacher you guys must be or sucking on her pen15 a worthless human being
3954,Elizabeth  Allen,come on guys pretty easy i got an a just a little boring all suggest taking her for an easy grade guaranteed
3955,Elizabeth  Allen,prof allan is not as bad as she is made out to be here yes she is a tough teacher and she expects a lot of work but she also is very willing to help you out with any questions this is not an impossible class but you must be prepared to do work
3956,Jim  Cantrell,is was and still is the best teacher at tech
3957,Jim  Cantrell,best teacher ever i believe he was even still teaching here
3958,Jim  Cantrell,great teacher awesome class
3959,Jim  Cantrell,best teacher ever take him if you can
3960,Jim  Cantrell,great teacher has a hard time pronouncing simple words though like ode for example
3961,Jim  Cantrell,ultimate techer ever
3962,Jim  Cantrell,randomly spouts off about how sexy he is sometimes people just understand
3963,Jim  Cantrell,jim is the coolest rock on rowdy
3964,Brian  Mullinix,horrible even if interested in the subject teaching take him if the only one find another course it will ruin any gpa you currently have
3965,Brian  Mullinix,no comments
3966,Brian  Mullinix,what the hell
3967,Brian  Mullinix,worst teacher ever what a loser
3968,Brian  Mullinix,would be a much better teacher if he would read the wild west book he talks about
3969,Brian  Mullinix,this guy complains about everything what a clown shoe
3970,Dennis  McAuliffe,bad professors dont waste your time with this stupid class because of this stupid professor
3971,Dennis  McAuliffe,let me just say i took his class last semester not only was it one of the worst experiences of my life but even now one semester later i still run and hide when i see him on campus please waste your time or your sanity
3972,Dennis  McAuliffe,no comments
3973,Dennis  McAuliffe,the only reason why this teacher is still around is because he is married to the dean he told us we have a final exam then he slaps us with a final paper and a final exam that covered over pages of reading the class was ridiculously boring to the point of being hilarious seems like an easy a but it the class sucks
3974,Dennis  McAuliffe,aagh he is the college husband in that sense more part of the architecture than part of the curriculum sometimes i see him coming and i run away bother you pay lots of money to be here
3975,Dennis  McAuliffe,do not take this class it was more like a boring theo class than english i felt unprepared bcause i have the bible memorized he also told us there be a final and there was plus a term paper i went to him for help once and he was very unhelpful and told me i was bad at his class english because i was in the msb avoid
3976,Dennis  McAuliffe,his class was a total waste of time and tuition take this class unless you can quote the bible offhand and take religious text at their literal meaning you talk about any typical english topics in this class purely religion in fact i just realized something this should not be an english class it is theology
3977,Dennis  McAuliffe,basically hell in a classroom only take this class if you are ridiculously interested in saints and are very catholic
3978,Dennis  McAuliffe,absolutely awful how does this man still have a job here
3979,Dennis  McAuliffe,i cannot recommend strongly enough against taking this class mcauliffe makes no effort to analyze works objectively or put them in a historical contextfeels more like a grade religion class
3980,Dennis  McAuliffe,very strange class you read books about nuns and monks fantasizing about jesus and weird things like that if you like taking the literal meaning of weird religious texts very seriously this class is for you mcauliffe has mood swings sometimes he is easy and nice sometimes he is condescending and makes you feel like a jerk for not reading
3981,Dennis  McAuliffe,no comments
3982,Dennis  McAuliffe,even though prof mcauliffe means well he deals with the subject matter in an uninteresting way he focuses on the most irrelevant and uninteresting aspects of the readings furthermore he is often irrational when discussing the texts and acts dogmatically when you prompt him on these interpretat
3983,Dennis  McAuliffe,he have a syllabus for the course so you would find out on monday that you had a big reading assignment for wed no good he also would say read selections from a book and not assign specific pages and then he would be disappointed if you read something he wanted you to avoid
3984,Dennis  McAuliffe,mcauliffe is wellmeaning man and a good scholar but a ineffective teacher with a fatal penchant for uninteresting tangents our class was poorly planned and conducted in a slack disoriented style until he gets this class together seek guidance into this great reading somewhere else
3985,Dennis  McAuliffe,dr mcauliffe is a really nice person he has trouble expressing himself in class but oneonone he is extremely helpful the reading load for his class was pretty light and just a term paper for graded work no midterm or final weblogs due on a weekly basis and a heavy emphasis on class discussion
3986,Dennis  McAuliffe,great if you like taking a class taught by a moron also great if you take the bible at its literal meaning like he does
3987,Dennis  McAuliffe,no comments
3988,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,she is sweet and can be funny at times her accent is hard to understand but she is always willing to help other than that the class is painstakingly awful entirely lecture some videos must follow the news before class you have to study for her tests she gives you a ton of information and really like when students miss class
3989,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,the class was mainly discussion based and movies tests are extremely curved overall she is a very nice professor and wants to give you a good grade
3990,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,dr hosseini was a great professor my only problem was she throws a lot of info at you for her exams so make sure to study even if people tell you she curves count on it very nice though and the course load is light take her

3994,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,dr hosseini is one of the cutest instructors at she gives the students a stack of notes on one of the first days of class and reads it word for word throughout the semester the class is actually interesting the exams are fairly easy if you pay attention in class and she curves like there is no tomorrow highly recommended
3995,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,loved her she is the best if you like boring but super easy classes take her and for islamic cultures she is really funny the tests are nothing but super easy

3999,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,she is very unclear but shes nice and if you beg her for a review she will give it to you read the book for the tests u dont need it for class she is so so boring tho she talks and talks and u probably will fall asleep easy course except for the tests

4005,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,hold on tight kids get ready to be bored out of your minds while your at it get ready to be tested on material that covered pay close attention to her facial expressions because look at you like your doing something wrong so paranoid about cheating actually funny she is difficult to understand and hard to hear dont
4006,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,difficult to understand and told us that she want us to use the bathroom during her class how old we are if someone has to use the bathroom that is their responibility to both their health and comfort i never encountered something like that with any other professor in my entire collegiate career i was shocked
4007,HENGAMEH  Hosseini,pretty nice and was willing to help me when i got sick and fell behidn in class knowledgeable about the class material the amount of notes can be overwhelming but tests are curved lot and grades are pretty generous so if you put in effort be rewarded
4008,"Fuller,",great guy great teacher take this class highly recomended devry sucks but this guy is awsome
4009,"Fuller,",fuller is awsome this is the kind of professor that makes you want to come to class and learn if math is hard for you then this is the professor you want
4010,"Fuller,",his very easy professor he spend time to the students before and after the class his the best professor in statistics he give a lot of extra credit the best
4011,Katherine  Jones,she is so politically biased that she will demean you in front of everyone if you have a different opinion even though she asked what your opinions are she also believes we need to get rid of math and science and focus on art trying to become a pa what does that mean about my job
4012,Katherine  Jones,she will make you print out almost every reading for class will have at least three readings every night of at least pages outrageous amount of work
4013,Katherine  Jones,if you are a design major like i was i do not recommend taking her her class is way too demanding she assumed her class was most important when it even relevant to my major expect to read every night and have a lot of homework she assigns a long paper that is split into smaller ones but still makes it difficult for you
4014,Katherine  Jones,terrible
4015,Katherine  Jones,horrible professor worst teacher ever had class discussions are so boring the hardest class i had tons of reading and work and she makes you write discussion questions for everything you read every night extremely harsh grader and papers are long and hard stay far away
4016,Katherine  Jones,
4017,Katherine  Jones,this class will expand your mind
4018,Katherine  Jones,i love you katharine jones best teacher ever
4019,Katherine  Jones,the class is too liberal but the readings are interesting average amount of work i like the papers but she is very understanding extremely nice lady and willing to help if asked the class is set up as a discussion which makes it fun and interesting papers interesting good class
4020,Katherine  Jones,nice lady interesting discussions most of the time a lot of reading for each class but its not that bad research papers require a lot of work but overall not a bad teacher
4021,Katherine  Jones,two huge papers but i improved a lot on my writing with her help keep up on your reading be fine
4022,Katherine  Jones,grreat teacher interesting lectures and very nice person i learned alot from her and improved alot in my writing bbuutt if ya take this class be prepared to work i dont regret it but as a design student it was really tough to keep up with at times
4023,Katherine  Jones,terrible impossible grader read every clas and tons od research projects and work
4024,Katherine  Jones,if you take this class you will have a ton of work she will kill you on papers this is definately not a class to take if you have a lot on your plate great teacher and interesting lectures at times but if you are a design major with a lot of work you might want to think twice
4025,Katherine  Jones,best teacher ever england should have never let this one go
4026,Katherine  Jones,so attractive so smart and soo brittish what more could ya ask for
4027,Katherine  Jones,brilliant and easy on the eyes
4028,Katherine  Jones,we had to study it was too liberal regardless how open minded you are
4029,Katherine  Jones,hi katherine jones let me push my book in your face fantastic
4030,Katherine  Jones,do not take this class if you have any type of a life or do not like to read cause that is all you will do in this class is read you will learn a lot about great britain though but i recommend taking her
4031,Christina  Zahajko,awful would not recommend unless you are in running start and have a job she says she goes over homework so you can have the right answer when you turn it in not true runs through class so fast and expect you to pick it up and repeat it back but unless u already have somewhat of a solid foundation in spanish you will be left behind
4032,Christina  Zahajko,if you have any other time commitments or have a good foundation of spanish already then you are in for the worst class of your life i spent about hours a night just on homework alone that we went over and it never helped because by the time you fixed a mistake in question she was on question
4033,Christina  Zahajko,very flamboyant fun and direct personality which i loved she is very serious about you taking the time to learn but learning a language is hard and she is preparing you to talk write and even sing in spanish attendance is extremely important and i would also recommend doing the extra credit which will help you towards the end to get an a
4034,Christina  Zahajko,if you have a full time job and are taking three classes do not take her class the only people who have time for hrs of studying per night are running start students who have no bills or other classes she barely responds to you will not know your grade until the report after the final do not take this class
4035,Christina  Zahajko,i love christina a lot her classes can be demanding if you miss or skip in for a world of hurt everyday is new subject material just do your reading and do your homework be prepared and you can learn a lot her clarity was sometimes an issue i was always asking other students what did she say
4036,Christina  Zahajko,this is the worst class ever take new language is hard to start most of students had learned spanish in high school but not she help me at all i rather spend time with tutor than spending any miserable second in her class never recommend this class if this is the first time you start learning spanish
4037,Christina  Zahajko,never have i felt like been in high school while college until i took her class she values class room participation and daily homework completion more than any other instructor had
4038,Christina  Zahajko,although senora zahajko is a very pleasant and charming lady she is very hard to learn from as a teacher she expects you to spend hours a day on homework then even grade most of it so you know if getting it right she zooms through new material and have time to answer students questions do not recommend her
4039,Christina  Zahajko,have to work very hard attendance is a must lots of high graded hw i learn more by studying the material with hw as a guide not doing hours of fill in the blanks a in and b in w all extra credit and it being my only class passionate but needs to adjust her teaching style wish there was another daytime professor
4040,Christina  Zahajko,i have taken her a year ago and now i am taking her second class span she is one of my favorite teacher in nsc this is because i learned so many valuable things through taking her class i am now speaking languages including spanish just take her class if you are interested in learning spanish
4041,Christina  Zahajko,do take this class if you want to learn the language no other profesor compares take this class if you just need to pass because you must work very hard
4042,Christina  Zahajko,zahajko was the worst instructor i have ever had she chose favorite students had those students grade their classmates tests absolute violation of privacy there raced through her lectures called out the student she like in front of the whole class and was just plain rude i absolutely do not recommend her
4043,Christina  Zahajko,this professor is a joke aced all my tests did every single homework assignment but was given a due to not being in class ever single day if you want to take a class that reminds you of high school then take her classes
4044,Christina  Zahajko,if you taken spanish before then prepare to be behind on day one senora zahajko moves quickly and pause for more than a minute to help anybody out daily homework is heavy and she is unsympathetic if you miss an assignment very biased to her favorite students and will easily single you out if you fall behind
4045,Christina  Zahajko,this class was a drag i imagine anyone passing unless they took spanish in hs i took and had hours of hw each day i even had to drop my other class just to keep up the material bounces from one to another and it is very difficult to digest her method of teaching i highly suggest a study group at least i got a high grade
4046,Christina  Zahajko,if you want easy a not an option but really an enthusiastic teacher and she knows what doing there are a lot of homework and expected to turn them in but really helpful quite generous in giving grades too and there are many extra credit opportunities
4047,Christina  Zahajko,if it for the high school spanish class i took before i done awful in this class not the best teacher i think you would have to spend a lot of time outside of class if never taken spanish before
4048,Christina  Zahajko,if you want an easy a because you took high school spanish take her if you want to learn how to speak spanish please take her cristina no h in the first her stuff she does assign a lot of homework all homework is required to be turned in to receive a grade tough but she gives many extra credit opportunities
4049,Christina  Zahajko,was an intensive class so it only last weeks so you have to engulf yourself in the class i enjoyed it and having spanish before i really appreciated her style shes culturally rich with info and breaks the language down very well do not take with very challenging classes as this will consume you with hw but take her
4050,Christina  Zahajko,she needs to reconsider her teaching style she is very clear but she rushes and the class have a lot of conversation practice activities
4051,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi is honestly the best i am so glad i took chinese in mount holyoke because of all the amazing professors even though she is really busy wang laoshi as one of them is helpful clear caring and motivating she is just like our mom
4052,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi is an amazing professor she effectively uses her teaching experience to the fullest presenting the material in clear way she makes sure her students not only understand but retain the information she gives also she shares details of the chinese culture which help illuminate the lessons
4053,Ying  Wang,intimidating at first and can be a little snappy when you clearly done the work but a spectacular professor and really cares about the students who are willing to put in the effort the class itself is a lot of work and it meets every day but you learn a ton from her
4054,Ying  Wang,i took chinese and lit classes with wang laoshi and found she was a passionate brilliant empathetic and kind prof she works harder for her students than most profs could even imagine she always chooses fascinating material to teach in lit classes and is structured and thorough in chinese classes just amazing
4055,Ying  Wang,taken both chinese language and lit courses with wang laoshi and the most passionate and empathetic teacher met she respects all her students and takes them for who they are one of the most knowledgable profs in lit around yet she seems to find herself learning from her students as well
4056,Ying  Wang,she expects you to work and work hard but if you do reward your efforts not going to meet you halfway though very kind and encouraging if you seek her out for help or guidance a really super professor
4057,Ying  Wang,i took contemporary chinese fiction class with her and really liked it the class was a good balance of lecture and discussion there was a lot of reading that was necessary to do and there were papers and and a min presentation
4058,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi hugged me one day suoyi wo hen is very understanding and helps you through chinese if having trouble she means well everyone should go to chinese table
4059,Ying  Wang,a very good teacher however her choice in course materials is severely lacking sweet and understanding she moves the class quickly which can be overwhelming at times fortunately the other two teachers move at a slower pace so it all balances out a good advisor too if looking for one
4060,Ying  Wang,amazing professor she makes learning chinese seem easy and its fun she is very understanding when it comes to being overloaded with other school work and always willing to help you
4061,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi is an awesome teacher i love this class a lot of fun and learned so much she is incredibly helpful and really knows what doing definitely a challenging class but well worth it
4062,Ying  Wang,wang lao shi is a really good professor more concerned with how you learn than how much you learn though that is pretty important very approachable so take chinese with her if you can
4063,Ying  Wang,she rocks my world very friendly intelligent and really cares about you
4064,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi rocks she cares about you and your learning knows a lot about teaching languages credit course hellish amount of work but at the end of the year you speak and chinese amazing it and the sweetest prof ever
4065,Ying  Wang,no comments
4066,Ying  Wang,wang lao shi is great she is very approachable she truly wants you to learn grades are just a way to gauge how well you are learning the material
4067,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi is very fair and approachable she really knows how to teach chinese grammar she also cares a lot about each progress in chinese
4068,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi is hot
4069,Ying  Wang,i miss wang lao shi
4070,Ying  Wang,wang laoshi is the best
4071,Alan  Bell,took as an elective after a year of no spanish classes this is not an easy class plan for hw everyday including research papers movie responses he talks a lot but good you need to hear spanish to learn actually kind pop quizes examsprompts in advance ask questions in class he will answer them thoroughly
4072,Alan  Bell,moody hard to rate him because one day wonderful helpful and nice and the next a total grouch critical and nasty he can be a tough grader but if you show interest and really give it your all not too bad i think a nice guy deep down just moody show him that your serious and it goes a long way
4073,Alan  Bell,professor bell takes the class very seriously many people get upset with him because they take it for an easy a and it is certainly not one that being said he is extremely knowledgeable and you can learn a lot in the class just put in the effort and you will do well
4074,Alan  Bell,he may come off as a bit mean but really because strict clear cut and he tells his students what to expect you know exactly what grades you have in his class very organized if you get to know him better he will help you out he looks thru bs and people scraped by ask for and get it
4075,Alan  Bell,dr bell can come off as a difficult professor however if you express interest in the class and attempt to participate in group discussions you should be fine def go talk to him in his office and be afraid to ask for help he also gives you extracredit and rewrites on big papers which is fair compensation for the demanding work
4076,Alan  Bell,we had an office meeting to go over my essay and he told me to my face that i make umbc look like a joke because i should not have gotten this should change have a gift for speak english and german fluently though not helpful at mostly until to pick favorites and not so luckies
4077,Alan  Bell,i took this professor for a summer spanish class my experience was terrible he tries to weed out the students that already know spanish if you get a question wrong he will insult you if you ask a question he will insult you if you forget an accent mark the whole question is wrong
4078,Alan  Bell,prof bell is unclear with directions and is very rude the class is supposed to focus on culture in film however he only focused on cinematic technique after looking at his comments on papers it is clear he only skimmed the paper before commenting his suggestions on sentence structure made it grammatically incorrect and took away the meaning
4079,Alan  Bell,naturally guy supresses it well tends to insult jokes but benign strict plan cuts u teaching ability book pace so fast even ppl exp hav medium diff aside from do not take if first exposure to span or selfstudy or if u miss time drop tech illiterate figure yro
4080,Alan  Bell,very straightfoward with material you know exactly what will be on an exam knows a lot about spain from experience a bit full of himself in terms of knowing interrupts students speaking a lot and brags about his daughter a lot but he gets his points across study guides exactly what will be on exams just pay attention
4081,Alan  Bell,very rude answer any questions and is quick to assume the worst in his students after this class never take a class with him again
4082,Alan  Bell,the class is very interesting with movies you would probably never have seen otherwise dr bell is very knowledgeable about the topics but it gets a bit boring his lectures only last about minutes though because you watch a film every class period quizzes are very hard make sure you read
4083,Alan  Bell,this is by far the worst spanish professor i have ever had and trust me a spanish student i was beyond fluent prior to taking this class and i love this subject he is rude arrogant cuts you off he cares about maintaining his image as a hard professor and all his grading is arbitrary and highly subjective do not take this class
4084,Alan  Bell,he is very knowledgable quizzes that he really prepare you for but the midterm and final are both in paper form so you can make up for your grade there definitely not an easy class but it is interesting material and the films arent bad
4085,Alan  Bell,he made me dislike interculural films he is rude cuts students off when he agree with what his students said i would not take this class he does not explain himself well enough for students to understand there are online chats and discussion board topics that are due every class also weekly quizes and page papers due each class
4086,Alan  Bell,i would not recommend this first year seminar to anyone although the material sounds fun and interesting too much busy work is expected from the course and its a struggle to get a decent grade his lack of clarity when it comes to assignments creates numerous difficulties throughout the year consider this a warning
4087,Alan  Bell,this class was definitely not what i was expecting for a seminar bell is definitely a hardass but if you follow the structure for this class you should be okay just and moan along the way you just have to regurgitate his opinions and if you like a film he want to hear about it so keep your mouth shut
4088,Alan  Bell,a senior and this is the first and only class ever had to drop this professor is rude demeaning and belittling to students not to mention misogynistic ladies especially steer clear unless you enjoy comments i loved spanish before this class and now hoping it been ruined for me
4089,Alan  Bell,very ignorant and arrogant made my life miserable
4090,Alan  Bell,had him for spanish and he comes off as arrogant hecause he likes to boast about his education and his successful friends try to pay attention to the things he emphasizes as they show up on the tests at least in although he is pretty arbitrary in his grading he was sometimes flexible and willing to negotiate points on exams
4091,Daniel  Vona,he is the best for students who want to study if you are lazy please take someone else i took him online this semester spt2013 all i had to do is do what he asked and i received an a thank you or an interesting semester professor vona
4092,Daniel  Vona,grad from class of dr vona is by far the best professor i had at jjc very attentive to students who show a willingness and desire to learn if you are willing to work and want to learn take as many classes with dr vona as possible
4093,Daniel  Vona,please if you need this class to graduate take another professor right now i have no idea if i am going to even pass this class provides no feedback all the students are emailing each other because we are all failing this is a horrible professor run for your life
4094,Daniel  Vona,i am a current student of his and i have to say that the man is convoluted to say the least he makes nothing clear his grading system is a mess and he is not as responsive to students concerns with his class as you would hope the text is informative i will admit but you feel right during or after his course in my opinion
4095,Daniel  Vona,if you are looking to get a quick a without any work this is definetely not the class for you this teacher is really requiring students to increase their critical thinking skills if you follow directions do well he does answer emails and he has provided a slew of information to assist you in doing your best excellent teacher
4096,Daniel  Vona,very pretentious and demanding yet it works out to your advantage he expects you to follow instructions and actually think about what reading his class will make you a better reader and student
4097,Daniel  Vona,does not stay on topic very boring
4098,Daniel  Vona,if you are ready to work hard for your grade then take this class however if you put a you can forget about an a in the end you would have learned something wonderful from both the course and the teacher
4099,Daniel  Vona,ya guys are crazy i just graduated from john jay thinking that i was going to fail this class to my surprise it was not that bad he is by far the best professor i ever had at john jay he makes you work and read alot this is what will be expected of you in grad school and the real world he teaches straight foward and explains student
4100,Daniel  Vona,i heard so much bad stuff about this man it was all lies his class is not bad he is very intelligient and no nonsense man u have to read the book a lot of work but easy take him u will get a better view about criminal justice
4101,Daniel  Vona,he thinks he is a dictator and is going to take over the world he looks down upon his students like they are nothing take crj425 with him take it with prof sung he is much better
4102,Daniel  Vona,this was by far the worse course i had ever taken not only is this professor rude disrespectful and confusing but he has the audacity to insult people i knew he was going to be a problem when i saw that he and panzarella wrote the book and by the way the book sucks also do not take him
4103,Daniel  Vona,i am not going to lie but in the beginig i hated this profeesor but if you hang in there he is not that bad he is the kind of professor who wants to test out the class who can hang trust me when i tell you at some points i felt like killing him in the end i recieved a a take too many classes with this course because this class is hard
4104,Daniel  Vona,i just dropped the course it was too stressful he grade fairly and always criticize the papers he yells insults and treat students as incompetents cannot email him and even try all he does it talk overall the class is boring but he persuades students to have a high level of critical thinking
4105,Daniel  Vona,worst prof had in my entire life heed the warning run your life he is awful does not provide u does not want be bothered he is totally confusing i have not learned anything in this course he does not want your input as to what u have learned he works off a book he and panzarella wrote together need i say more
4106,Daniel  Vona,this guy is a the class is very boring and the first two weeks all he does is yall at us he grades you papers and he believe anything is wrong with that overall stay clear from this and take anyother professor all he does all period is this is a clear and present danger warning take another prof
4107,Daniel  Vona,this man is a nutcase he is not clear as to what he wants even though he gives you pages to read trying to explain it when you follow the directions as he clearly explains it he still gives you a horrible grade he also emailed the whole class five times in the first weeks telling us all to drop the class get out i warned you
4108,Daniel  Vona,obviously in the psc department because it is a system of control
4109,Daniel  Vona,professor vona is a very hard teacher get out while you can and switch to professor hanson professor vona is very unclear and an unfair grader he follows a point system get out
4110,Daniel  Vona,took vona for org crime in amer online he seems very difficult but if you follow his instructions exactly as he wants the assignments done then do well missed assignments and discussions boards and got a there is a lot of reading but it is a class
4111,Robert  Panzarella,i dont understand the negative comments no midterm no finals just a short reading everyday and short writing assignment easiest a you will ever get in college trust me
4112,Robert  Panzarella,panzarella has the weirdest grading system and his lectures are long boring and irrelevant a small writing assignment is due everyday but it is so easy although he is not the best teacher this class is an easy a
4113,Robert  Panzarella,one of the best professors in john jay professor panzarella is a very knowledgeable man the class is very informative professor treats everybody with respect
4114,Robert  Panzarella,professor panzarella is a very fair grader plus he is very well educated person i have learned a lot from the professor the class was very informative professor treats his students as adults very interesting course not that hard all you have to do is just read the texts loved this class
4115,Robert  Panzarella,prof panzarella is firm but fair he lets you determine your grade thru attendance quizzes and writing assgnmts he gives no breaks and very strict but as long as you miss anything and complete all your work you will do great i had a problem understanding an assgnmt and he explained it to me so that i could understand it better
4116,Robert  Panzarella,one of the worst professors ever had the guy is in love with himself home assignments are excessive lectures are filled with misinformation the man is arrogant avoid if possible
4117,Robert  Panzarella,this professor is the worst professor i ever had he gets off the subject and talks about other things for over an hour he drops point on papers for the most stupidest reasons his online quizzes are all screwed up and he is definitely boring you will fall asleep please save yourself the trouble and headache do not take any of his classes
4118,Robert  Panzarella,this has got to be by far the worse professor ever his teaching style seriously is the worse ever seen he is not helpful yes he may be knowledgeable but he will not help you if you need it my gpa is a and i work very hard he makes it seem like this is his only class us students are taking believe me he is being reported
4119,Robert  Panzarella,if you are a full time student good luck because this prof gives a ton of work as if this is the only class we are taking asks for too much detail and very picky with assignments and writing if you can save yourself and avoid it also many students complained about this prof outside this website so that should def be a sign
4120,Robert  Panzarella,avoid at all costs
4121,Robert  Panzarella,i am so glad i dont have to take him again
4122,Robert  Panzarella,this professor is great and gives a lot of real knowledge to the students but he does give a lot of work thats the reason why students are giving him these horrible ratings because they do not like to the work he has a lot of knowledge of the federal system great
4123,Robert  Panzarella,i must say he has been one of hardest educators ever experienced the textbook he cowrote is like reading another language and never learning that new language he will definitely ruin your gpa he is of no help and cares less if you learn or not students are unable to do well on the discussion boards on quizzes even worst never take him
4124,Robert  Panzarella,i know where this guy thinks he is teaching an online class and is insane do not take him this is not graduate school but is taught like it is a level course like he hates student and gets them by assigning ridiculous work
4125,Robert  Panzarella,panzeralla is focused on his own text books that he has compiled he has no time for students nor helping them i have no idea why he is teaching at all when he has no interest in helping students at all he does not respond to emails and if you want a response it is best you cc the dean or chairperson take him
4126,Robert  Panzarella,this was the hardest class that i have ever took in my life but i put in many all nighters and managed to get an a do not take this class with a full schedule stay away the professor is a bit bitter at that i am happy that it is all over
4127,Robert  Panzarella,all i can say is do not take this class i had to complain to the department about this professor and the course if blackboard shuts down the student suffers the quizes and word essays are graded unfairly the professor is the worst i am far from lazy or stupid eventually i dropped it to protect my gpa
4128,Robert  Panzarella,worst professor ever told me i was bound to get a f when i could not withdrawal from the of the students could not do the work due to blackboard outage how am i suppose to pass it with no work to be graded do not take him
4129,Robert  Panzarella,do not i repeat do not take this class the professor is the worst i have ever encountered in my life and he has the nerve to call himself an educator he is no help at all i took it online big mistake w the text is very hard to read the discussion board and quizez are set up ensure you get a poor grade blackboard has constant outages
4130,Robert  Panzarella,avoid this class might prevent me from graduating never thought a multiply choice test could be so hard or a undergrad text could be so difficult the prof refuse to help if you have any problems and will refer you to the syllabus if you ask him a question the class is a gpa killer
4131,Denis  Janz,grades on a point grading scale he is so nice and always energetic and ready to teach i would recommend him to anyone
4132,Denis  Janz,great professor explains everything with clarity literally what he talks about in class on the test i would take him again
4133,Denis  Janz,had a class with dr janz before and i took him again this semester a great professor not interested in religion at all and he explained everything so clearly and straightforward that it was easy to remember and understand tests are mc essay plus he uses the canadian grading scale for an added bonus
4134,Denis  Janz,you can miss or classes a semester but by far the best part of this class is he uses the canadian grading scale a
4135,Denis  Janz,janz is cute he makes terrible jokes and laughs at them which is really precious no one really talked in class no computers he writes on the chalkboard and you write down everything he says class was pretty boring tests are difficult must read textbook to do well canadian grading scale
4136,Denis  Janz,lectures are informative and enjoyable and tests are straight to the point very courteous to you if you have an impossible schedule
4137,Denis  Janz,janz is a great teacher his class made me so relaxed and a great guy he is very interesting and his class is not hard take him
4138,Denis  Janz,he uses the canadian grading scale need i say more
4139,Denis  Janz,pretty easy tests are questions and one essay he gives hints about what essay question will be dont have to buy textbook short readings no quizzes uses canadian grading scale b etc
4140,Denis  Janz,an awesome teacher and so nice and he grades on what he calls the canadian scale where start at great
4141,Denis  Janz,this class was really easy go to class take notes study for the tests one tests participation grade piece of cake oh and start at
4142,Denis  Janz,dr janz is amazing and his wife is a very lucky woman his class is extremely interesting and a sharp dresser
4143,Denis  Janz,i had professor janz for intro to religion super nice the class was easy and i actually learned the material his tests are relatively easy although he tends to focus on dates let that scare youthe only way to get less than a b in any class he teaches is by not coming or taking notes
4144,Denis  Janz,he is super nice kind of boring to listen to attendence not required as long as you know someone who takes good notes the tests are with an essay he is an easy grader
4145,Denis  Janz,three tests all go to class and pay attn and a breeze attendance not mandatory so if you know someone who takes good notes you can alternate skpping class prof is really boring talks in a low monotonelike voice
4146,Denis  Janz,world religions terrible class so long and drawn out so many useless details but since we have to take it i guess this teacher was alright theres only tests mostly from lectures
4147,Denis  Janz,nice professor his tests are all and there are only total no other grades no final one really must attend class because some of his test questions come from random facts he mentions in class but not many an is an a so if you just pay attention you should do great and always read the i am section in the book not an overload
4148,Denis  Janz,argue with him just believe what he tells you and write about it do fine
4149,Denis  Janz,very nice and he possesses a subtle sense of humor so if you pay attention in class missing out care to read another reason you should pay attention in class well he gives three tests per term and many of the questions refer to seemingly random unimportant remarks he makes in class paying the
4150,Denis  Janz,he is very nice and anything from an is an a
4151,Stuart  Lynn,this quizzes and tests are so ambiguous not an easy class i did poorly on everything and studied for each thing
4152,Stuart  Lynn,pretty much an easy teacher but can be a little tough if teaching a hard class
4153,Stuart  Lynn,haha this guy cracks me up laugh at his jokes and ur his new best freind test are okay i never studied and still did decent if u study ur set
4154,Stuart  Lynn,stuey is the man very intelligent and knowledgeable though he has a hard time making his point clear sometimes read the material and ask questions and do just fine above all participate and do well
4155,Stuart  Lynn,no comments
4156,Stuart  Lynn,the easiest class at assumption no homeowrk the quizes and tests are very easy they are everything he states in class but at times can word the questions wierd
4157,Stuart  Lynn,overall easy show up to class and things go all right sometimes the test questions worded very clearly was somewhat unapproachable outside of class he knows what talking about and seems like a good guy
4158,Stuart  Lynn,excellent teacher good lectures however he is a hard grader and his are difficult
4159,Stuart  Lynn,easy class we get out early and there is no homework except for studying for quizzes or exams he has a short paper at the end lynn is very clear and easy to understand
4160,Bob  Nelson,rambles uncontrollably in general he is a nice guy but completely out of his league teaching accounting he reads straight off the slides that are all posted on sakai can barely answer questions his whole section of the lodmod project is a mess and he cant even help you because he is using another professors outline this class is a mess
4161,Bob  Nelson,this class too difficult the exams are pure memorization so if you memorize the notes its really easy to get an a he is sometimes unclear in the lectures but he really knows what talking about class was sometimes boring and attendance mandatory
4162,Bob  Nelson,very cool guy lots of industry experience extremely helpful definitely remembers students names i wish i could take another class taught by him the class is straight memorization but work hard and it will pay off and buy the textbook
4163,Bob  Nelson,boring teacher but he is very passionate about the class remember students names buy the text book because we use it at all tests are difficult and basically all memorization if you study a lot you will be okay
4164,Bob  Nelson,he is very boring and he loves to tell jokes that are not funny it is not helpful at all even if you ask him questions the class and the tests are hard
4165,Bob  Nelson,nice guy but hard grader
4166,Bob  Nelson,he is a horrible teacher
4167,Bob  Nelson,he is very boring at times the class is hard and the test is hard he will work with you if you dont get something or if you have to make up a test doesnt remmeber his students names
4168,Bob  Nelson,ok guy and an ok professor the class is great and since he is the only one that teaches it you really have no choice he knows what talking about and he tries to make it interesting if you get into it the class can be fun easy no matter what
4169,Bob  Nelson,uses pwer points class is boring but he tells funny stories tests are tough only there is a lot of info to memorize
4170,Bob  Nelson,very interesting wants everyone to do well in his class tries very hard to reach each individual student
4171,Bob  Nelson,very interesting class and he makes it fun reccommend taking the class
4172,Bob  Nelson,no comments
4173,Bob  Nelson,lots of info funny guy can easily miss class and still catch up webct rocks
4174,Bob  Nelson,no comments
4175,Bob  Nelson,great teacher
4176,Bob  Nelson,boring useless class
4177,Bob  Nelson,pointless information stutters and babbles hard to pay attention
4178,Steven  Schlossman,really great teacher very interested in the content he is teaching and is legitimately interested in his students and their learning he enjoys getting to know his students and values content and concepts of writing over grammar i hope to take another class with him
4179,Steven  Schlossman,so enthusiastic amazing and actually a good teacher who wants you to understand things great
4180,Steven  Schlossman,he is a professor who is genuinely interested in the material he teaches his teaching style is refreshing he is genuinely interested in the performance of his students and offers much guidance
4181,Thompson- Brieg,before taking this class i thought the reviews would be wrong but they are all accurate she calls on you out of no where collects homework days after it was due grades unfairly if possible take a different section
4182,Thompson- Brieg,took this class in hs and got a much better grade then than i currently am condescending in office and does not explain things well at all book is overpriced bc of its cd but unfort needed class is boring but showing up is important likes to put quizzes on fridays so you do overall do not recommend find a different section
4183,Thompson- Brieg,she frequently calls on you out of nowhere and often makes you feel stupid when you know the answer
4184,Thompson- Brieg,tons of quizzes and homework every class a class where you definitely have to stay on top of things or youll get behind quickly she is really nice but sometimes not very clear she tries to make class fun by doing activities but most of the time not
4185,Thompson- Brieg,she really likes when you participate in class make sure you are prepared for class because it allows more opportunities to participate
4186,Thompson- Brieg,i am frequently made to feel stupid when i do not understand a concept or know the answer but she never attempts to explain it or help me in any way i had mono for a month and a half this semester and still managed to only miss her class twice she was not at all understanding
4187,Thompson- Brieg,not the greatest teacher had in my life dont really look forward to classes as they become awkward when no one answers questions and every minute seems like it goes on forever not really too helpful if you visit for office hours looking forward to the end of the semester
4188,Thompson- Brieg,great teacher you get homework but they hard and they actually help you get a quiz every friday but they hard and you need to study a lot for them she is very helpful i strongly recommend her
4189,Thompson- Brieg,if you go to class with a good attitude and smile on you will be much better off if you know the answer in class raise your hand and you will do well
4190,Thompson- Brieg,if u had four yrs of spanish in high school pretty much review from it packed into semester not too hard but a lot of unnecessary work out of class and most of the time work due next day usually isnt even discussed until some other random day when u prolly threw it away thinking she go over it u lose class participation
4191,Thompson- Brieg,i liked thought the class was easy just a lot of time spent on out of class assignments which were not very hard you just spend a lot of time doing busy work
4192,Thompson- Brieg,i recommend thompson she moves extremely fast and is hard to follow along with even after having years of high school spanish she randomly calls on people and often makes you look dumb if you know the answer comes off as being a cold person for the most part
4193,Thompson- Brieg,she is a very hard grade and at some points might not clarify herself as much as possible in class but she is always willing to help you one on one whenever possible i highly suggest that you take her if you are up for a challenge and want to learn
4194,Albert  Pyzik,pretty easy class but i also took years of chem in high school ap for one of those years his tests are really easy but he is a very picky grader boring lecturer but i thought that he explained things well
4195,Albert  Pyzik,nice guy terrible at teaching does not teach does not offer help explains things incorrectly if i taken ap chem in high school i would have failed he definitely picks favorites and pretty sure that he hates women
4196,Albert  Pyzik,terrible teacher he just drones on and on and talks about everything but chemistry an analytical chemist so a very picky grader he gave me a on the first lab i switched into and now i have an a get out of while you can
4197,Albert  Pyzik,i skipped almost every friday and still made an a in his class not the best teacher but if you decide to put in the work its an easy class all you need to do is go over his powerpoints and do the suggested problems
4198,Albert  Pyzik,awful professor extremely boring and way too difficult i really say learned that much from him never put so much effort into a class and gotten nothing out of it gradewise or knowledgewise
4199,Albert  Pyzik,worst prof ever i basically taught myself everything in that course horrible explanations when i went in for help he seemed like he had no interest in helping me i will never ever take a class from him again
4200,Albert  Pyzik,worst professor i have ever had he answer questions correctly and is useless when it comes to out of class help he is disorganized and does not know the material he teaches
4201,Albert  Pyzik,really nice guy but can make things confusing especially lab reports can make class fun though
4202,Albert  Pyzik,very nice man but has no business being a teacher of any kind would actually guess at answers to questions that i knew were incorrect very boring class also just read to us off a powerpoint i learned times more in high school chem
4203,Albert  Pyzik,difficult professor did well in the class only out of spite for his teaching abilities
4204,Albert  Pyzik,very frustrating professor never gave help when asked your job to find that answer very unclear our class had to correct his mistakes a nice guy not so great prof
4205,Albert  Pyzik,he was hard and picked favorites do not get on his bad side
4206,Albert  Pyzik,no comments
4207,Albert  Pyzik,wanted to shoot myself in class learned nothing taught myself everything you were such a nice man but a bad prof need to learn how to interact with college students more
4208,Albert  Pyzik,bad explanations
4209,Albert  Pyzik,needs to be fired lousy teacher bad temper what iss denison thinking having this guy here
4210,Albert  Pyzik,i dont think he needs to be fired liked him as a prof and learned a lot
4211,Albert  Pyzik,no comments
4212,Albert  Pyzik,no comments
4213,Albert  Pyzik,very unhelpful in getting students to understand the material he needs to be fired and is a waste of our parents money
4214,Ken  Moynihan,really nice guy class kind of drags on but he does frequently let you out early tough grader on papers you should easily get a b in his class
4215,Ken  Moynihan,he reminds me of my grandfather i want to hug the guy gets confused easily in class but helpful when you go to see him during his office hours you can rewrite your papers if you dont do well on them too which is a plus overall not difficult to get at least a in his class
4216,Ken  Moynihan,easytofollow format but get anything out of his classes grades papers really hard and writes the meanest comments on them
4217,Ken  Moynihan,extremely nice guy he is very old and gets confused easily however class can drag but is very easy and you only have to do a few papers and some homeworks hes very easy going and such a cute old man
4218,Ken  Moynihan,his class is boring and the homework has nothing to do with the papers he is a very nice guy and will help you if you need it
4219,Ken  Moynihan,he was a really good teacher it could get boring but he let us out early alot and if you do all your work you should do fine
4220,Ken  Moynihan,the whole class was taught off the internet count on this guy to bore you to death and give you papers that will take you days the only sources for your papers are primary documents which were written hundreds of years ago and are hard to understand
4221,Ken  Moynihan,some of the readings were interesting such a sweet guy but forgetful and confused about who you are in relation to his class so nice though definately worth the class
4222,Ken  Moynihan,really good professor lots of reading to do and its a heavily lecture based class but he tries really hard to relate to his students and makes you laugh a little too overall good guy
4223,Ken  Moynihan,the class is easy and interesting however i found the online format hard to follow
4224,Ken  Moynihan,better be a democrat the more liberal the better he was ok if you want a good worc hist class go to worcester state and take it with jake powers who mix politics in class
4225,Ken  Moynihan,nice guy however the online course for history is hard to follow
4226,Ellen  Knapp,i have to admit class is not the easiest but its only because she wants to make sure you get the material for example i got a bad grade on our last test but i was able to make up the grade by making an appointment with her and teaching her how to do the ones i got wrong she is always available for extra help
4227,Ellen  Knapp,she is a nice lady but she is not always the easiest person to follow it might not have helped that her class was only minutes long but i really learn much during her lectures i had to learn and figure out things on my own the assignments were almost all consistent of mymathlab questions that do too much but she is nice
4228,Ellen  Knapp,she is a great teacher have to do the work in order to maintain a c or higher the test are not that difficult because you can use a cheat sheet make sure you keep all your notes and papers she hands back because she does a binder check that is worth points which can help your grade a lot
4229,Ellen  Knapp,she is an extremly nice lady her teacher is clear sometimes and not others she doesnt teach everything in the homework so get it done before to ask questions she lets you use a cheat sheet for her tests overall if you just do the homework and spend a little time you can easily get a b not to bad of a class gives extra credit to help you
4230,Ellen  Knapp,she is really nice and her class is pretty easy as long as you do the homework when she teaches she can be pretty confusing but overall shes not too bad she tries to help out her students any way that she can i would totally take her class again
4231,Ellen  Knapp,i feel this professor is not very efficient a very nice lady and if you go to office hours or tutoring to ask her specific questions one on one helpful otherwise not i feel like miss something if i attend class yet going feels useless the tests are nothing like the quizzes homework or classwork
4232,Ellen  Knapp,the woman needs help she cant teach she confuses the hell out of you probably for her entertainment and then she gets chalk all over you and her if you sit in the front you better study in her class and maybe youll get a c
4233,Ellen  Knapp,i really like her shes very helpful and wants you to do well she will also go out of her way to make a test review so prepared for the tests and exams i would take her again
4234,Ellen  Knapp,no comments
4235,Ellen  Knapp,cant teach
4236,Ellen  Knapp,horrible
4237,Ellen  Knapp,this class was ridiculously easy just do the homework ahead of time so that you can ask her questions the tests are simple
4238,Ellen  Knapp,this woman is the worst teacher ever she does not care who fails all she wants to do is make your life miserable cuz she is miserable i went to class regularily attempted at her impossible hw got on all labs and did ok on the tests but i still failed
4239,Ellen  Knapp,no comments
4240,Ellen  Knapp,she often does the problems wrong in class which becomes very confusing also will not allow you to make up work even if you have legit reasons id suggest the mwf class rather than tuesday and thursday
4241,Ellen  Knapp,great teacher organized well prepared class structure and extremely helpful you will not fail if you follow the pattern monday notes wednesday homework help friday quiz kind of kooky but well worth your time
4242,Ellen  Knapp,i hated this class nice lady normal college professor not great at math and i usually get a b in her class i struggled with a c quizzes every week stressed me out
4243,Ellen  Knapp,lectures kinda suck lots of homework but quizzes every friday right from the homework and easy ass math lab will keep your grades up willing to help even if she is a little weird
4244,Ellen  Knapp,she explains things well but sometimes she will give the most complicated way to solve a problem she goes over homework assignments at least twice before the quiz and reviews just before the quiz the only think bad is she is sometimes confusing but if you tell her your confused explain
4245,Ellen  Knapp,she has very poor teaching skills
4246,Darel  Swenson,i learned a lot from him
4247,Darel  Swenson,not bad for homework but tests suck the big one very controversial questions will give a little on some questions but others will not even if he is wrong probably look for another teacher
4248,Darel  Swenson,after yrs in many educational settings courses of study etc have not run into an instructor like this to students frequent rants over minor infractions learning environment due to cantankerous instructor learning process stunted by erratic moods class should not have to be this way
4249,Darel  Swenson,i looked up to him when i started my paralegal studies as time went i hated his class he was never wrong even when half the class proved it on a test also piss him off because drop you a whole letter grade just because he can nice guy if you like hitler
4250,Darel  Swenson,no comments
4251,Darel  Swenson,his tests are god awful
4252,Darel  Swenson,of all the paralegal so far of he is the best he is the only one i learn from just like any teacher you have to give them a chance and learn their teaching style he will begin to grow on you i am in this program to learn and he is the only one that it helping with this quest
4253,Darel  Swenson,this guy is nothing but an arrogant bully you can contribute but one point off and you still get low graded even the brightest a students hated this idiot
4254,Darel  Swenson,i was bored out of my mind it was a night class and i stand it so obviously i am not going for that anymore i would recommend not missing any classes because you will get behind
4255,Darel  Swenson,if you enroll in the program you will have to take him no matter what but a little advice make sure you take good notes and he will repeat the information you need to write down oh and no stupid outburts he hates it
4256,John  Weigand,i am currently a junior student in his studio and i could not be more happy of the fact that he is my clarinet professor i was mediocre before i started my clarinet journey at wvu and now at a point i never thought i could reach yes he does have high standards and he can be harsh but it is to push you to aim high and improve
4257,John  Weigand,he is strict and a definite pain in the butt and kind of a jerk however as long as you do what he says and get your work done then you will get really good at clarinet his teaching method is like magic
4258,John  Weigand,loved this prof he was one of the best i have ever had
4259,John  Weigand,avoid at all cost
4260,John  Weigand,kind of a pain in the butt but one of the best teachers ever had a fabulous musician
4261,John  Weigand,awesome director of chamber winds
4262,John  Weigand,what a
4263,John  Weigand,he rocks no with him but real life folks really helpful but you have to keep pushing yourself go dr weigand
4264,John  Weigand,i was in his studio a few years back and i love him
4265,John  Weigand,dr.wiggity is an awesome small ensable director great ideas and very helpful those of you that think he is hot need help
4266,John  Weigand,i know what talkin bout but dr weigand is waay hot
4267,John  Weigand,ew the not hot factor cause like older than my dad way talented teacher and if you get on his good side he will definately help you when you need it if you like basketball and hate marching band be his fave
4268,Arthur  Tyson,mr tyson is hard in the first weeks of class flunking or catching on realize he requires dedication on some level to even slide i took bio at another college times dropped it boring grading required me getting on board suddenly the subject teacher changed everything almost later i still remember it
4269,Arthur  Tyson,took biology and in i can say he had one of the classes that i learned a lot from taught a short creationism section along with everything was unique in that regard
4270,Arthur  Tyson,mr tyson is an inspiration if you plan to use any college degree for any area you should take his biology course while his daily tests are annoying if you keep up flunking by the week but if you read the daily requirement you will have no problem with the simple tests it prepares anyone how to study for a college cours
4271,Arthur  Tyson,this professor gets your attention on what college is about if you go into any med or science field you need to take this guy he will prepare you for mcats vcats pcats i would highly recommend this guy if you are going this route or even nursing if you want a science for the hell of it take someone else i aced my bio part on my pcat
4272,Arthur  Tyson,i really enjoyed tyson i found him very entertaining his tests were difficult but it just made the a i made all the more rewarding i enjoyed the challenge he is always trying to improve his class and asks students for feedback on every test lectures not very interesting i learned most of the stuff from the book overall good class
4273,Arthur  Tyson,wow he so hard and makes you feel stupid if you have to take him
4274,Arthur  Tyson,worst professor i ever had like him at all and i like most people
4275,Arthur  Tyson,pretty tough but not all his fault study people
4276,Arthur  Tyson,one of the hardest tests ever taken makes you learn and remember a lot of info
4277,Arthur  Tyson,do not take this man he is so hard if you want to do well your better taking someone else his tests are extremely hard and analitical i studied like crazy and managed to pull a c out of the class
4278,Arthur  Tyson,he goes way to fast in the class hands on really hands on at all you get to he reads straight from the book i loved biology till he ruined it for me
4279,Arthur  Tyson,no comments
4280,David  Duhon,i am glad he was my capstone professor because i enjoyed his class so much most of the class involves group work so find good partners on the first day his personality is something you have to be prepared for as he can be a little abrasive to sensitive people sometimes assignment reqs were unclear but he does everything to help you understand
4281,David  Duhon,he was one of the best teachers i have ever had he taught practical application in his class he did not give you a grade that you did not earn if you participate and do your work you should pass
4282,David  Duhon,the teacher is the best you will learn a lot and makes the class interesting
4283,David  Duhon,his class is awesome it is very interesting you learn alot of stuff you can actually use there are no real tests in his class just a lot of assignments take him for any class but i think all he teaches is strategy
4284,David  Duhon,this cat is da bomb we had a blast
4285,David  Duhon,an interesting class it usually held my attention several of us tried to figure out what country he was from but we his accent was unique his lectures are understandable though
4286,Ray  Bowling,very professional instructor very knowledgeable on the topic that he teaches i strongly recommend him
4287,Ray  Bowling,bowling is a good teacher but the best at making the class fun and interesting this class is one of the topics that the funniest but you will have to take
4288,Ray  Bowling,ray is an awesome instructor i had him for evidence he fully explains the material and encorporates real life scenarios and experiences in his lessons his only flaw is his bad taste in football teams just kidding
4289,Ray  Bowling,ray is awesome very understanding
4290,Ray  Bowling,no comments
4291,Ray  Bowling,easy class just do the workbooks and you should pass the class he has essays on some tests but they were easy and straightforward gives you plenty of opportunity for extra credit
4292,Ray  Bowling,mr bowling is such a wondeful instructor his class is very easy and enjoyable he lets you out early his tests are and he gives you extra credit availability he is really nice and is willing to help with anything highly recommended
4293,Ray  Bowling,great class great teacher highly recommened
4294,Ray  Bowling,one of the finest instructors at miramar college he takes the time to ensure that each and every student understands the material presented and always treats the students with respect reguardless of their opinion
4295,Ray  Bowling,the nicest man in the world he makes sure you understand the laws he wants you to be a good cop he does everything to help you out
4296,Ray  Bowling,great teacher take notes and be involved and pass
4297,Ray  Bowling,a very nice man and he always helps you on your tests he tries to tell funny stories but sexual ones make him blush one of those cool grandpa types
4298,Ken  Milner,dr milner is so great
4299,Ken  Milner,i absolutely love dr milner he is very passionate about teaching and learning class generally meets once a week with discussions and online tests and there is nothing too difficult if you want to be inspired take this class
4300,Ken  Milner,absolutely amazing take him if you can his class is mostly online meets about once a week during class he more so gives life lessons speaks from experience he want anyone to fail never had a prof who cares so much about their wellbeing online tests online final weekly discussions a few papers it
4301,Ken  Milner,best prefesesor i have ever had
4302,Ken  Milner,he is so entertaining he is so funny but i felt like i did not learn all that much we had a lot of in class discussion and it was based mostly on the chapter reading for that week weekly discussion questions on myclasses he loves what he does and has a variety of experience which i thought was really cool
4303,Ken  Milner,he teach he only gives tests based on reading then talks for an hour every class he is not helpful at all and respond to emails when you have questions
4304,Ken  Milner,enjoyable class as he is very knowledgeable on the teaching profession he regularly remind you of assignments but all due dates are in the syllabus so get in the habit off looking at it often there are online tests and online final relatively easy grader
4305,Ken  Milner,i enjoyed his class he is forgetful and deadlines do jump out at you from nowhere but he is fair he listens to you and if you need an extension you got it i love dr milner
4306,Ken  Milner,milner is terrible he brags about being organized but never knows what chapter on or what we have due he changes the class schedule all the time is super condescending teach towards tests or go over them and assigns really stupid assignments for seemingly no reason take him if you have the choice
4307,Ken  Milner,this professor was a great one i looked forward to attending this class every week he really knows what talking about and is a great teacher there is a good amount of work and it is mostly online but if you keep up with the workthen do fine highly recommeded
4308,Ken  Milner,everything online never really understood when things were due or what our assignments were if you turn everything in you will be fine you just have to ask him multiple times when things are due really easy class just a confusing professor
4309,Ken  Milner,probably the worst professor had in my college career so far keep track of grades and let you know until last minute if you are missing anything my entire grade was changed because he tried to tell me my paper was late when it late at all i would not suggest him
4310,Ken  Milner,worst prof ever had really inconsistent grading never keeps track of papers after you turn them in and never fully explains assignments never makes himself available to talk or explain anything expects you to check your email every day but never responds to anything you send him also classes without much notice avoid him
4311,Ken  Milner,great professor i was considering changing my major until i took his class truly loves teaching and is very helpful expects you to know due dates in the syllabus a lot of online assignments overall a great teacher recommend for any class
4312,Ken  Milner,all assignments are submitted online so you can use your book for everything including midterms and finals
4313,Ken  Milner,milner is a great teacher and knows his stuff but he is the most disorganized person ever never responds to emails will admit he read them but doesnt respond he changes dates around forgets what he assigned and when things are due easy class but i never knew what was going on
4314,Ken  Milner,milner is not clear at all i would not recommend taking an education calss with him he knows what he is teaching but always changes dates and does not tell you what you need to for the class
4315,Ken  Milner,he is one of the best teachers at salisbury he knows what he teaches he loves what he teaches and he cares he is by far and away a great teacher and i hope he keeps it up for a long time
4316,Ken  Milner,knows his material easy class if you pay attention and read the assignments alot of work at the end of the semester had about papers all at the last week because waited till the last minute got a b fun discussions
4317,Ken  Milner,i agree with the last person milner is awesome he makes the class enjoyable and i got a lot out of discussion he teaches you exactly what you need to know to be an effective teacher but at the same time makes you learn it on your own if you hope to be a great teacher take milner you will enjoy it
4318,John  Nelson,dr nelson was very passionate and loved engaging everyone on biweekly hikes what i did not like was his attitude and the grading scale he had good bad days and they were unpredictable grading wise genus and species identifying practicals and quizzes were weighted the same entire class was out of pts near impossible to get an a
4319,John  Nelson,dr nelson makes a rather boring class not interested in botany enjoyable and entertaining it takes some getting used to but drop in the first week be prepared to study every week for lecture and field quizzes which seems like a lot but doable put in the effort and dr nelson will see that and reflect it in your grade
4320,John  Nelson,this class is not easy but dr nelson wants you to do well you will enjoy this class it turns into a botany family field trips every week a quiz each day you must keep up on your terminology nomenclature to do well this class requires work but is so rewarding dr nelson is awesome bio i think take one of his classes
4321,John  Nelson,dr nelson is funny passionate about botany makes class interesting take field trips each week followed by a field quiz everything is cumulative so dr n expects you to keep up with knowing the plants and botany terminology as long as you study frequently you will receive a good fair grade my favorite professor class ever taken
4322,John  Nelson,this class does require a lot of work because you have to keep up with new plants learned every week in lab going outside to state parks etc i was really overwhelmed at first but it ended up being manageable and if you put forth some effort you can get a good grade nelson is so nice and fun and i enjoyed this class overall
4323,John  Nelson,this class does take a lot of time and work but i believe it was all worth it in the end dr nelson is a very smart man and normally pretty nice he does have his days though the semester project takes a lot of time and you should start it as early as possible
4324,John  Nelson,this class requires as much studying and class prep as does organic chem you will have a quiz every class you have a huge plant collection to do on top of large comprehensive exams i learned a great deal in this class but still would not recommend it unless you are a workaholic
4325,John  Nelson,a senior and this was the worst class ever taken i chose this professor because he had good ratings here but they been updated in a couple years because something must have happened to turn this guy into a total prick he is mean unhelpful and just downright rude to students no not take this professor
4326,John  Nelson,he is picky but his class his fun and interesting
4327,John  Nelson,this class was very interesting and definately unforgettable i really hate plants but he makes it fun and the field trips make class go by pretty fast
4328,John  Nelson,great professor loves to teach classes are a lot of fun his spring flora class was one of the most memorable classes i ever took even though it was pretty hard but what else do you expect from an upper level course i would definitely recommend him
4329,John  Nelson,one of the few actually good teachers at this university he might take a little getting used to but he is very available and willing to help he knows the stuff and is good at explaining best not to talk in class unless asked the field trips are good but the class has too many students
4330,John  Nelson,his tests are pretty picky and his lectures are boring take good notes and study for days before the test
4331,John  Nelson,dr nelson is a great teacher his class was interesting make sure you go to take notes because the tests comes directly from the notes he put parts of old exams in the library on reserve make sure you get those bc the exact questions will be on the test if you study you should do well
4332,John  Nelson,no comments
4333,John  Nelson,tests cover a lot of information take really good notes
4334,John  Nelson,he trys to be entertaining the class is boring the tests are hard if you take this class be ready to study your butt off cause the tests cover like each
4335,John  Nelson,a lot of information but not too bad a really nice teacher and willing to help out his students no matter what
4336,John  Nelson,no comments
4337,John  Nelson,very good teacher very clear and precise at explaining everything be sure to take excellent notes because the whole test is from them i recommend purchasing a tape recorder weighs heavily on plants since he is a botanist do much animals
4338,Paulette  Swartzfager,typical writing of papers every week kind of interesting when she went off on tangents not her fault that critical reading is very high school i would take her again

4347,Paulette  Swartzfager,a great teacher if you know how to take what offering she picks great stories to read and discusses them more intelligently than any other english professor a little ball of joy and when you talk to her it always rubs off on you
4348,Paulette  Swartzfager,very easy.love the stories.other books are very easy.testa are essay but isnt hard because she lets u pick questions the class before the test.love her class.class discussions are good but gives very very easy pop quiz if no one reads
4349,Paulette  Swartzfager,she is awsome a great english teacher
4350,Paulette  Swartzfager,she i just give her the best ratings because easy she is an amazing person and makes herself more of a person than a professor
4351,Paulette  Swartzfager,very easy just be nice to her and love you she has a little bit of add but is the best english teacher ever her classes are extremly hard to get into but so worth it
4352,Paulette  Swartzfager,she is great a bit random at times but her class is very easy and she is very helpful definitedly take her for common curriculum
4353,Paulette  Swartzfager,awesome awesome totally be aware that she does make you think but for paper revision conferences she goes step by step with you when making corrections

4357,Paulette  Swartzfager,shes awwsome laid back really funny and realizes that how other teachers teach literature sucks it dry and makes us really board shes got an awsome attitude and you look forward to going to her class
4358,Marybeth  Redmond,mb was probably the best teacher i have ever had and smc is idiotic to have let her go her classed were definitely some of the hardest read most effort necessary in my years at smc but she taught me how to become such a better writer she deeply cares how her students do do the work accept criticism and improve based on that criticism
4359,Marybeth  Redmond,eh it was ok
4360,Marybeth  Redmond,redmond is intelligent experienced in her field knows what talking about the class is a lot of work but you learn so much id totally recommend her
4361,Marybeth  Redmond,sorry but i despise this woman she is part time and brand new she must play totally by the rules because she is new i think she will ever get off her high hourse i just want her to go back to where she freakin came from despise her
4362,Douglas  Johansen,great teacher but the class is so boring this could have been an online class you need to come to class or you will fail
4363,Douglas  Johansen,this guy is a joke soo boring useless information
4364,Douglas  Johansen,this guy is a joke soo boring useless information
4365,Douglas  Johansen,t
4366,Douglas  Johansen,easy class tests are online so open book gives some of the essay questions ahead of time speak up in class once or twice and you will do great
4367,Douglas  Johansen,his class was a waste of my life take someone else
4368,Douglas  Johansen,this class was so easy as long as you paid attention in class and participates you will pass his lectures are boring and consist of like a billion slides which you dont have to pay attention to because they are online overall a very easy class
4369,Douglas  Johansen,nice guy tries hard to make it interesting but still a snooze fest he does show plenty of little videos and commercials to break it up a bit test are straight forward and right out of class go to class and pay attention you got an a want someone to give you an a for being alive enroll at phoenix or ju
4370,Douglas  Johansen,the presentation is a big part of your grade but you work on it for most of the semester it really that big of a deal since not all due at once
4371,Douglas  Johansen,hes cool act like you want to learn something and you probably will test are online and he will help you through his project if you ask class can be slow but again participate and all is good
4372,Douglas  Johansen,international marketing was horrible the project sucks it will consume your whole semester he is the only teacher for international marketing so have fun he is a tool in class but nice in his office
4373,Douglas  Johansen,the class kind of drags on a bit the professor covers most everything on the test in class but you will have to study for his test do all the assigined work and study guides
4374,Douglas  Johansen,easy if you do the work
4375,Douglas  Johansen,class goes by a little slow but he is a nice guy his projects are very open ended but he is pretty helpful has a good sense of humor
4376,Douglas  Johansen,good teacher willing to help outside of class very easy even though the project may seem difficult at first it really bad
4377,Douglas  Johansen,too boring
4378,Douglas  Johansen,boring didnt really stimulate my thinking read material straight off powerpoints nice guy but bored me class is relatively easy
4379,Douglas  Johansen,buy the book tests are from pp
4380,Douglas  Johansen,everyone gets at least a b on group project sketchy grader on essay questions very nice though
4381,Douglas  Johansen,bring a pillow and a book this class is soo not that hard but he is very unclear with his instructions and his lectures drag on no need to get the book just print out the power points becuase thats what the tests are on
4382,Patricia  Cassin,if you read your texed book get an a
4383,Patricia  Cassin,she really teach she just goes over projection notes that made however she does give you copies of the notes which help when trying to study but in order to pass you have to pay some serious attention
4384,Patricia  Cassin,she cannot teach she is the worst professor ever and she is old
4385,Patricia  Cassin,she isnot good for esl student if you are esl student then forget it she is good in lab but in lecture she is ok she explains everything using projector so for her easy for us it is very hard
4386,Patricia  Cassin,i hated her at first but as time passed by i began to like her she is a good teacher and knows what she is talking about she is open to questions pain in the neck about opentoed shoes in lab and attendance in both classes she is friendly and cares for her students i went from failing her class to getting a
4387,Patricia  Cassin,i took her class this spring even though her class was not really easy if you study hard it be problem to get good grade she cares about her students a lot and helps students how to study she is a very good prof
4388,Patricia  Cassin,i took her class in fall as my first semester at first she seems hard and her tests are hard infact but she is very helpful and nice her tests are exactlly what she talks about in class and her your notes that are taaken during the class and from the book she is such a nice lady
4389,Patricia  Cassin,no comments
4390,Patricia  Cassin,very tough teacher if you have taken the prereqs and paid attention you should do fine this high school people take some responsibility for yourselves
4391,Patricia  Cassin,be forewarned this lady is hard the other reviews are right she does look at you like you are dumb at times when you know something the class is hard and her test are impossible
4392,Patricia  Cassin,this was my first semester college and i got her as my prof oh my gosh its like being in a nightmare in her class
4393,Patricia  Cassin,no comments
4394,Patricia  Cassin,she is nasty she is very unhelpful if you ask her for help she makes you feel like a moron like you should know if in a higher than third grade class
4395,Patricia  Cassin,in lab she is very nice but not in lecture she doesnt explain everything in the students evel she talks very sophisticated and is very boring cause all she does is talk and point
4396,Margo  Regan,lets do all the work not very helpful to students
4397,Margo  Regan,margo is a great teacher is a class that the teach to get experience and too big for her to teach every1 do the work and more than likely get an a the grads really want u to pass is a class she teaches and if ur passionate about acting take her i really learned alot
4398,Margo  Regan,ok she lets to the ta do everything so it really depends on the ta you have as to wether you like it or not basically show up and do ok
4399,Margo  Regan,no comments
4400,Margo  Regan,you have to get on the good side of margo if she likes you she will basically give you a good grade if she like you you will probably get a bad grade no matter what most theatre classes are basically about coming to class and participating so that is what she will expect of you

4403,Harry  Meshaw,really wants his students to do well lectures are long and wordy but you will do well if you go to class
4404,Harry  Meshaw,i really enjoyed the material taught in this course meshaw truly wants his students to do well in the class and gives everything needed to get a good grade class attendance is imperative to get all the information covered in the homework and quizzes but if you show up have everything you need
4405,Harry  Meshaw,easy class scattered professor but effective miss a few weeks you will suffer in the class miss once you are ok quizzez fill in the blank tests are covered in the class so you know exactly what he wants to see just show up take decent notes its a pretty easy a
4406,Harry  Meshaw,do not take meshaw he does not teach anything and he mumbles so badly you cannot understand anything he says he simply uses class time to go over the cases in each chapter and the homework his tests are very very difficult instead take this class online at fscj
4407,Harry  Meshaw,tests were pretty tough all he does in class is go over homework teach anything homework has nothing to do with the tests the class average was so low he let us take the third test home and still most people thought it was too difficult
4408,Harry  Meshaw,study his examples and you go wrong with his tests very straightforward the essays on the tests are not hard go to his office if you need him for help nice professor take him if you can
4409,Harry  Meshaw,essays easy overall great class take him you regret it
4410,Harry  Meshaw,very boring professor his exams are half essay half multiple choice his only classes seem to meet once a week avoid missing classes very poor time management with holidays we got to the final week with chapters of material left extremely difficult to get in touch with as well take schupp
4411,Harry  Meshaw,easy class knowing the cases that will be covered before had really pays off know his examples they will be on tests he throws no curves and is concerned with his students excellent way to brush hours for the cpa exam
4412,Harry  Meshaw,assignments are a breeze there are only test and attendance that are part of your grade the info is mostly from the book with multiple choice and short answer he is a nice guy and you mind going to class
4413,Harry  Meshaw,no comments

4415,Dean  Karras,solid professor attendance lateness is key get there on time and pay attention be fine not the best but not the worst either
4416,Dean  Karras,professor karras is stern and speaks in a monotone manner he show much of his personality a reserved fair guy pick your karate partner wisely because be stuck with them all semester my partner had a nice body so you know i was chillin no flying kicks in this class mostly defensive grappling maneuvers
4417,Dean  Karras,really sure about karate at first never took anything like it but this professor gets you through everything you need to know for every part of the semester anything you need to see be glad to show you again and gives you all the review in the world for the final
4418,Dean  Karras,theirs a written midterm which he basically tell you all the answers to the class before and a final for the final you have to perform all the moves you learned through the semester i thought i was going fail because i could never remember any of the moves from the class before but he let us record him doing the moves i ended up getting an a
4419,Dean  Karras,do not take this class worst class i have ever taken first off the class is located in the colleges wrestling room which smells absolutely terrible and the mats are infected with a skin fungus known as ring worm he makes you stand infront of class and perfom kerate moves embarrasing he can be very irrational and rude stay away
4420,Dean  Karras,very rude if he doesnt like you better off not asking anything good luck with this stand up guy lol
4421,Dean  Karras,i was very hesitant to take this class but honestly prof karras is the best he really knows his stuff and is willing to help anyone who asks for it there is a midterm and a practical final but every technique is clearly reviewed and gone over multiple times throughout the semester take karate with this prof have fun and regret it
4422,Dean  Karras,professor class was very easy as long as you show up very good instructor and very helpful when asking to review techniques again the only downside is you have to work with a partner and if you get stuck with someone who want to put the effort in they make the class more difficult for you
4423,Dean  Karras,he was intimidating at first but as time unraveled he turned out to be a cool guy when he explains his demos he is very deliberate and clear he is also willing to go over something you missed my favorite thing about him was that over the course he would give little life speeches about maintain awareness very nice man and i overall learned a lot
4424,Dean  Karras,at first it was interesting in the beginning of classes we have to mediate we are not allowed to have necklaces of course you cant have jeans he assigns you with a partner to study the karate moves sometimes its annoying
4425,Dean  Karras,prof karras teaches very concisely and has a wellorganized curriculum if you pay attention to the moves and show up to class an easy a graded based on your participation midterm multiple choice and final practical exam strict about attendance even dropped a few students during the last week of class
4426,Dean  Karras,i put hard work into it got a on the midterm and he still gave me a b
4427,Dean  Karras,great professor not the easiest class but if your willing to put in the effort do well
4428,Dean  Karras,excellent professor if not serious about the class then you will not do too well but as long as you follow his instructions miss more than classes and pay attention be fine if you have any problems with any moves help you out until you get it
4429,Dean  Karras,umm can some give e his email address
4430,Dean  Karras,great class great prof
4431,Dean  Karras,okay so most people take this just for the credits and thats all he goes too hard
4432,Dean  Karras,i hated this class please run for the hills
4433,Dean  Karras,hes pretty clear and patient with his students hes a very serious guy and you cant talk in class or that will deff sway your grade trust me is it an easy a no but if you pay attention dont talk go to every class and show a lot of interest and get the moves the way he wants it then it will be
4434,Dean  Karras,very informative very patient and willing to help attendance and dress code are maniditory loved his class
4435,Arthur  Rowe,a really nice prof but definitely expects you to work and practice hard he seems to really understand level of commitment and teaches accordingly only negative point is that he say too much so you have to ask him if you want an a specific answer
4436,Arthur  Rowe,so helpful oh my goodness he finds ways to help me in between lessons i was struggling with my tremolos for months and he said like sentence and that fixed the problem great teacher
4437,Arthur  Rowe,not helpful at all never enjoyed his teaching and i was not the only one who thought of this
4438,Arthur  Rowe,in a word yay
4439,Arthur  Rowe,no comments
4440,Robert  Ware,this guy care much about teaching i could just go on and say the same thing everyone else did but i he has accomplished alot in his life and now making money on the side for talking about it to a class i learned nothing for this class although i was happy with my grade never had a teacher cancel so many classes
4441,Robert  Ware,his favotite subject robert ware rude and cancels class without much warning very unprofessional reply to emails
4442,Robert  Ware,its unfortunate that a professor teaching a professional mba program can be so incompetent he came to class without any type of plan and to make matters worse he seemed to think it was perfectly acceptable to talk about himself the entire hour class
4443,Robert  Ware,wow what a jerk he treats you like an idiot online and is not helpful he makes you feel like he is way to busy to bother with you
4444,Robert  Ware,he only has you do a few writing assignments which bad but very unclear he definitely follow his syllabus and threw in a surprise final at the end after saying we were done work cool at all plus he graded it harder than any other paper bringing down my grade big time
4445,Robert  Ware,everything you hear is absolutely true very bad teacher and full of himself
4446,Robert  Ware,he brags about his accomplishments a lot instead of covering material that needs to be covered he is always at least minutes late to class but if you leave he holds it against you he loses assignments frequently and take fault even though there are people with missing assignments
4447,Robert  Ware,if this class had been for law students and a full year it would have been fine but important sections of business law commericial paper life and death of a corporation were ignored in favor of consitutional law and current events if you take him be sure to read the whole book
4448,Robert  Ware,ware is the worst teacher i have ever encountered at a level i think everyone is aware how to site a paper he spends too much time talking about about his accomplishments and how much he has been discriminated against grow up and talk about the subject matter
4449,Robert  Ware,this professor does not practice what he preaches grading system and requirements were constantly changing very poorly prepared for class and time spent in class not properly administrated spent too much time bragging about himself vs teaching the class topic
4450,Robert  Ware,quite arrogant and entertain any opinions other than his own admittedly subjective grader changed requirements with literally no notice only thing help you learn in class is that he a went to harvard b worked for reuters c has a law degree phd hear it ad nauseum
4451,Robert  Ware,all about me me me me terrible teacher needs to learn to teach he seems to have met all the top in his impressive career but forgets that we really do not care unless he can impart some knowledge
4452,Robert  Ware,impressive educational background overshadowed by his arrogant attitude very full of himself pretentious and disorganized no substance in his classes he might have valuable experience but no good since he just can not teach it has been a dissapontment to have him as a profressor a v o i d
4453,Robert  Ware,pompous arrogant disorganized his disorganization may work out in your favor only one test then a presentation for final much busy work does not care for opinions other than his own although he asks for participation avoid
4454,Robert  Ware,horrible rude arrogant scum professor i wouldnt recommend him for anything
4455,Robert  Ware,once you get past the bragging and pompous attitude he is actually really nice class is not too difficult and set up so you learn more than just hearing lectures all the time
4456,Robert  Ware,this was the poorest attempt at organizing a class that i have ever seen changed grading criteria with no notice sent rude emails that did not answer the question know how to use the online system bragged about law phd school every class
4457,Robert  Ware,ware is rude does not follow his schedule very opininated if your opinion the same as his you are wrong and he will make you feel really stupid likes to brag a lot about anything and everything tests are hard lots of busy work
4458,Robert  Ware,online course posted no course info until weeks after course began sent rude and generally incomprehensible emails moved up due dates without notice repeatedly mentions that he went to law school brand new already a horrible professor
4459,Anne  Wall,love love love dr wall as a teacher i have had her for several classes in my graduate program she is very well organized with class content there is no way to mess anything up or not to understand what is expected i love that she uses schoology for the class setup it is a million times better than d2l wish i had her for undergrad classes
4460,Anne  Wall,this class is a definite gpa booster about half of the time you even be in class the entire time if you have questions she answers them fully the course layout was very easy to interpret
4461,Anne  Wall,super super easy class there is hardly any homework in this class basically what you finish in class is your homework she makes the assignments pretty short and easy she grade hard at all just show up and do the assignments and group work worth points but super easy then you will pass easily
4462,Anne  Wall,extremely easy class just do the work dr wall is really nice and knows what she is talking about assignments were not hard unless not good with technology a lot of group projects
4463,Anne  Wall,very easy class but she can be a bit rude class consists of busy work and a few projects which you will have plenty of time to do
4464,Anne  Wall,this class was very easy if you missed class its fine because she records the class she goes straight to the point which i loved because i never stayed the whole time she usually finishes in about minutes then you can do whatever you also means leave some class periods we did stay long on some of the more challenging topics
4465,Anne  Wall,awesome professor she is super nice and very knowledgeable when it comes to technology class consists of a lot of busy work but nothing that is hard she shows you lots of amazing free webbased resources that will be very helpful in the future classroom definitely recommend professor wall
4466,Anne  Wall,one of the easiest education courses she tells you exactly what to do and how to do it follow her directions and you will be fine lots of busy work to do but if you stay on top of it it is easy
4467,Anne  Wall,class grade is mostly the projects which require a lot of time but are very useful to the real classroom and for the most part are interesting to do dr wall is very helpful and one of the nicest teachers had
4468,Anne  Wall,really wonderful professor the class projects do require a lot of time however as long as you pace yourself you should be fine class agrees to advise against taking together because they both have time consuming projects no textbook attendance you use macs grade is dependent upon projects for most part
4469,Anne  Wall,dr wall is an amazing professor she makes technology easy to understand as well as fun
4470,Anne  Wall,i have her for a summer class and she make the class even close to summer friendly we had to do the exact same amount of work that the sixteen week class did and was almost totally non explanatory but expeted us to damn well know do not take her for a summer class want to commit ritual suicide
4471,Anne  Wall,dr wall is a great teacher and really nice the education project difficult but it is time consuming she provides plenty of class time to work on the project and is always willing to help
4472,Anne  Wall,dr wall is one of the greatest professors on campus very helpful and she knows her stuff the class is very interesting and very useful toward teachingfinally a class you feel like you waste your time taking
4473,Anne  Wall,great teacher loved every minute of this class
4474,Anne  Wall,dr wall is wonderful and explains things very clearly she is very strict on attendance though make sure you are in her class every day or if you do have to miss it make sure you have a good excuse overall this education class was wonderful and she knows her stuff i would recommend her
4475,Anne  Wall,the nicest and most helpful teacher that i have ever had there is a lot of work to do but she explains it so well it really is not that bad you will have to do the same amount of work in this class whether you take her or not but in my opinion you could not get a more helpful professor
4476,Anne  Wall,the absolute best prof ever had if i could have taken her for all my educ classes i might not have swithched majors go to class and pay attention which isnt hard because she makes it interesting
4477,Anne  Wall,wonderful teacher i would recommend her to anyone the project is the most important part of the grade so stay up on it she will help you in any way that she can she treats everyone the same and grades you by how hard you work anyone who says that dr wall is not a good teacher has a severe attitude problem
4478,Anne  Wall,dont listen to the person who said she was bad dr wall is an excellent teacher who does everything in her power to make you understand what she is talking about.if i could take dr wall for every class i would be very happy the class is awesome and its fun to boot take dr wall she rocks
4479,Monica  Rodriguez,she is very hard to understand and that puts a damper on the interest level of the class however the professor that took over for her this semester is very clear and easy to understand explains things better she is also pretty hot too
4480,Monica  Rodriguez,even though i got an a in this class it was a torture to go to every single class she was so unprepared and unorganized she was confusing and went on and on about one slide forever she was hard to understand and so boring nice lady but if i had known i would have taken the class with someone else i learned nothing terrible professor
4481,Monica  Rodriguez,really nice person terribly hard language barrier boring class easy if you follow study guide really nice person but not a teacher i would take again
4482,Monica  Rodriguez,i recently finished taking a course prof rodriguez.she is a very good professor who is well prepared for class and brings interesting material to be discussed much of what she teaches can be applied after walking out of class her accent does not effect her teaching ability overall great helpful and understanding professor class recommende
4483,Monica  Rodriguez,she was very prepared thoughtful and stimulating
4484,Monica  Rodriguez,i loved this class and look forward to talking another course with this professor in the future an incredibly nice and understanding woman
4485,Monica  Rodriguez,language barrier very tough very nice person awful tests would never have taken had i known
4486,Monica  Rodriguez,understand a word she says i attend any of the classes and manage a b on the exams i suggest not taking a class with this professor if you would like to understand the material the first time its taught
4487,Monica  Rodriguez,her accent is not that bad once you get used to it though she is adorable and extremely nice she can sometimes put ppl to sleep she is really passionate about the subject and a really great professor you need to go to class just txtbk website and its pretty easy after that
4488,Monica  Rodriguez,a great teacher and keeps the subject matter interesting
4489,Monica  Rodriguez,very intelligent professor hard to understand her shes really good about putting up test grades now all notes are posted online dont really need to go to class no attendance good for gpa if your psyc savvy
4490,Monica  Rodriguez,very boring teacher i was interested in psychology a lot before i took this class but because she bored me to death in class i could care less about child development now you do not need to go to class just print out the slides she is really disorganized with her notes and takes forever to post the grades
4491,Monica  Rodriguez,notes and text contradict one another takes her forever to get through one slide even bother trying to understand her notes online which is helpful
4492,Monica  Rodriguez,this class was actually very easy and the ta was amazingly helpful although she gave long notes they could easily be shortened simply by using your own words she gave us study guides for each exam very easy class she does although have a strong spanish accent but she is willing to repeat herself if needed
4493,Monica  Rodriguez,not a terribly hard teacher or one that will change the way you think but nice to have a class every once in awhile simple and straight forward
4494,Monica  Rodriguez,speaks with lots of and which can be distracting and frustrating
4495,Monica  Rodriguez,class is interesting regardless of prof but she is sometimes difficult to follow with her accent not her fault class is easy if u go to txtbook website book itself is not really necessary
4496,Monica  Rodriguez,multiple choice right from the book
4497,Monica  Rodriguez,she really cares about our grasp of the material and tries to make us enjoy it she may not be as rigorous as others but she definately holds us accountable i have really enjoyed having her as a professor she is so knowledgable and really makes us think
4498,Monica  Rodriguez,cares so much about her students unlike many profs she wants students to do well material is she covers material very well her notes are very clear she also posts her notes online which is helpful shes always willing to help a student as long as they ask of the best prof had
4499,Frank  Thomas,he is an okay teacher yes he knows the law but is hard of hearing and boring
4500,Frank  Thomas,he is a good professor i just wish he understood that if you have a hospital note you must have been very ill
4501,Frank  Thomas,no comments
4502,Frank  Thomas,awesome prof learned a lot about the law that i know
4503,Frank  Thomas,excellent knowledge of law and cases relevant to education
4504,Simon  Koumjian,the proverbial one trick pony typical never built a thing professor.ask to see his work its laughable
4505,Simon  Koumjian,no comments
4506,Simon  Koumjian,if you want an egotistacal teacher with a napoleon complex he is for you he has very little practical experience and it is very evident
4507,Simon  Koumjian,great at pushing you to do your best a great teacher overall although very blunt and sometimes unfair excellent at conceptual ideas
4508,Simon  Koumjian,simon knows his stuff he is more interested in opening students eyes to other forms of architecture and other approaches to the creative process the work is demanding but if interested in arch be excited to try new things he is also always available and you can call him anytime
4509,Simon  Koumjian,simon is a very difficult and demanding teacher if you take him plan on getting much sleep or having much time to do anything else besides design work not even your other school work he is extremely abstract and does not accept traditional style designs
4510,Simon  Koumjian,simon cowell
4511,Simon  Koumjian,an odd sense of humor will tell u that failing to make u work better makes u redo ur work really into details not very clear on what he wants very untraditional in thought i liked his subs better
4512,Simon  Koumjian,he was very helpful very interested in your own opinions and those of the class he was good at trying to find your strong point and evaluated you based on what you do best and what you tried to improve because of him i collages
4513,Ellie  Ragland,get me wrong ellie is probably one of the nicest and most interesting people ever had the pleasure of meeting however her lectures are confusing she provides very little structure and tends to get off topic a lot when teaching lacan chances are unless a grad student not going to get anything from this class
4514,Ellie  Ragland,ellie is a wonderful woman that cares about her learning if you ask her questions do her best to help she tells a lot of stories about her feminist days and about her family expect an a if you never participate in class or take notes the material is difficult but becomes clearer and easier as the class goes on
4515,Ellie  Ragland,the best thing to do in this class is pick the little gems of knowledge out of the rest of the mental dustcloud that gets kicked up and never settles extremely nice woman a rockstar in france but the difficult to grasp and the grading mostly random start wikipediaing lacan now if you want to understand but your survive
4516,Ellie  Ragland,outstanding
4517,Ellie  Ragland,this woman is so strange she missed so many classes that it was ridiculous we spent the entire semester studying lacan but i remember a bit of it somehow i pulled an a and a on my papers even though i had absolutely no idea what i was talking about
4518,Ellie  Ragland,jacques lacan i know his name now we studied this man the entire semester and i wrote papers that i had absolutely no clue what they meant when i was finished very confusing she tried but it that helpful she is an easy grader though just go to class and keep your notes
4519,Ellie  Ragland,her class was on lacan but when she tried to help us understand it just made me more confused
4520,Ellie  Ragland,an excellent professor who challenges students to think to reconstruct knowledge and how their learning process
4521,Ellie  Ragland,worst english teacher every see frequently missed class and that was rather relieving sitting through that class was dreadfully in class she only talked about strange critical theory and it mentally healthier to just zone out her lectures
4522,Vincent  Ferraro,vinnie is the best professor had by far his lectures were the most interesting ever sat in you can tell he really cares about his job and it shows in his energy the workload no homework really easy mc quizzes and two straightforward essays easy a if you go to lecture and actually listen and take notes
4523,Vincent  Ferraro,still my favorite professor to date
4524,Vincent  Ferraro,the hands down to the best professor ever had hope enjoying his retired life i miss you vinnie
4525,Vincent  Ferraro,a little intimidating at first but this is a man who you will not forget amazing lectures that will leave you thinking long after you left the classroom
4526,Vincent  Ferraro,welcoming and informative plays music before class sometimes class consisted of lectures and a weekly quiz lectures were enjoyable and engaging quizzes were easy if you read the blog posts and documents overall one of the best professors especially at mount holyoke would recommend taking his class even if not majoring in politics
4527,Vincent  Ferraro,take this class without a doubt the most inspirational professor i have ever had he was one of the reasons i chose to come to this college you be disapointed
4528,Vincent  Ferraro,my favorite professor on earth
4529,Vincent  Ferraro,his lectures were pretty pointless in my opinion i only attended class on the days we had class he sends you an email of all the readings that will be on the quizzes the only thing was there was so many articles to read and he really wanted you to know the dates of things but funny and approachable during class would recommend
4530,Vincent  Ferraro,an inspirational lecturer to say the least we had to maintain an online blog aside from his weekly quizzes
4531,Vincent  Ferraro,will not disappoint amazing lectures you be bored very helpful and funny prof as well always there to talk or give advice if you have the chance take his courses one of the best professors had the pleasure to know in my years as an undergrad
4532,Vincent  Ferraro,it is mindblowing how brilliant this man is knows so much about the world class is easy weekly quizzes multiple choice and a final project either website or blog the best professor at mhc and i even like politics but this class was awesome
4533,Vincent  Ferraro,vinnie is incredibly wellliked all over campusand as soon as you take a class from him know why smart funny and pushes you to consider other points of view in a way that invalidate your own he respects your opinion as long as you can back it up will take more classes from him in the future
4534,Vincent  Ferraro,professor lectures exciting and very informative
4535,Vincent  Ferraro,vinnie is the most amazing teacher i would definitely take his class again and respect him as a teacher and as a person
4536,Vincent  Ferraro,this class will not disappoint you vinnie is a brilliant humble man and an amazing lecturer he makes world politics interesting and dynamic in a liberal arts setting despite his mit degree he always emphasizes how mhc women are the best intellectuals of the generation to change the world very inspiring and awesome
4537,Vincent  Ferraro,he is cool he is also the type of prof that gives student a break bc he knows how hard we work and that sometimes mhc can get really really overwhelming
4538,Vincent  Ferraro,international political economy is the name of the class i loved every moment of it the readings are manageable the papers are interesting and his passion for political economy is contagious everyone should take this class
4539,Vincent  Ferraro,best class ever taken
4540,Vincent  Ferraro,ferraro is a great professor and you will learn a lot straight forward directions half of your grade is your quiz average and he drops the lowest grades once you figure out what kind of questions he asks on the quizzes they are relatively easy he is pretty lenient with the final project grades take this class
4541,Vincent  Ferraro,vinnie teaches his students that the pursuit of knowledge is not a burden but a worthy goal some find his classes stressful because the learning process is not as painful as they have grown to expect his lectures are not for the cynics and jaded of heart keep your mind open and you will learn more than you thought possible with so much peace
4542,Christa  Downer,i took gender and social change with dr downer it was an online class she expects a lot but it is great the readings she selects are eye opening i really enjoyed the class a lot and recommend you take her if you have the opportunity
4543,Christa  Downer,wonderful teacher extremely helpful
4544,Christa  Downer,very understanding and helpful she lets you make up work and redo papers that you might not have done so well on computer coarse is simple to follow and as long as you do the work pass
4545,Christa  Downer,no comments
4546,Christa  Downer,pretty cool i learned a lot and really nice and helpful
4547,Tina  Laplaca,like the happy helpful momish teacher in a film does everything she can to help each student individually both with class projects and related outside projects wants you to succeed
4548,Tina  Laplaca,the best professor in the whole college cares for your project and grade like her own more than a teacher she is a mentor
4549,Tina  Laplaca,awesome teacher learned a lot from her
4550,Tina  Laplaca,get on her good side she is full of connections
4551,Tina  Laplaca,tina laplaca is very great at what she does she juggles a lot being both a professor and an advisor she gives great advice and wants you to succeed in life her lectures are fun and informational because she shares both her knowledge and personal experiences she is highly recommended you wont be disappointed
4552,Tina  Laplaca,i love professor laplaca like a mother to her students extremely pleasant and genuinely wants you to succeed the problem is that she gives you an extremely long time to finish each project which how the real world is also seen people with bad projects still manage to get because a very easy grader
4553,Tina  Laplaca,very nice woman projects are fun and easy to complete imo always there for students but sometimes to the extent of being a pushover re due dates and quality like most of art courses critiques are too lax and the quality of work is severely overrated she is also the advisor for the graphic design club
4554,Tina  Laplaca,great teacherloves typography makes the class fun and environment friendly.would take any class from her again
4555,Tina  Laplaca,omg professor laplaca is the best professor at mercer honestly i wish i could take all my adv classes with her she makes class interesting and involves all the students in activities class discussions and critiques i love the class and her as the professor
4556,Tina  Laplaca,tina is a great professor helped me so much in understanding graphic design in a whole new sense she is also my advisor and has guided me well throughout the semesters very understanding and is a fair grader as well loved her classes and her

4564,Tina  Laplaca,fantastically high energetic has great stories and amazing experiences most importantly you leave with a better portfolio and knowing a lot more about the graphic design world
4565,Tina  Laplaca,fun and exciting class she makes learning interesting
4566,Tina  Laplaca,tina is a great professor she helped me grow into the leader i have become today we grew very close over the time that i attended her classes and i would recommend her to anyone she is a great educator mentor and friend
4567,Laura  Shrum,she is fair to all students at the graduate level she talk about attendance but she still cares about it she teaches molecular biology in a new way her stress is on experiment designing and techniques
4568,Laura  Shrum,took her for senior seminar and she was wonderful i learned so much from her and she is always willing to help
4569,Laura  Shrum,this is a hard class but she explains stuff thoroughly be prepared to write like a professional stenographer tests are hard be prepared to design your own experiment study weeks in advance to make a c or a b
4570,Laura  Shrum,funny lady and shes hot tests tend to be a bit lenghty however
4571,Laura  Shrum,no comments
4572,Edith  Hays,hays is definitely set in her ways but shes fair her rules are simple i dont know why its hard for people to follow them dont be on your phone come to class prepared and dont disrupt class she wants the answers on tests in a specific way but she gives you exactly what you need to study word for word so its not hard
4573,Edith  Hays,this class is a complete waste of time the entire class time is spent filling out worksheets with no explanation on how to actually teach the material to children her tests are mostly fill in the answer and are information from the book that has nothing to do with what is gone over in class
4574,Edith  Hays,hays is really sweet and nice if you use your phone she will call you out as long as you pay attention and do your work you wont have a problem with her her test reviews are really helpful when it comes to the test so do them make sure you go to class in order to to edmodo big part of grade
4575,Edith  Hays,professor hays is a sweet lady but gets caught up with silly things like people having phones out or drinking something other than water she is a much better teacher than previous professors i have had for math concepts study for tests and memorize definitions as she is a tough grader and wants specific definitions
4576,Edith  Hays,she is definitely moody for sure her class really that difficult just very strict like no food and phones on the table no whispering when talking attendance is mandatory be late the classwork and assignments is pretty easy
4577,Edith  Hays,hays is a very serious professor as long as you eat or drink something other than water she will like you you should never use your phone in her class or she will call you out she lets you make up lost points for assignments as long as you turn them in on time make sure you come to class because edmodo is a large part of your grade
4578,Edith  Hays,mediocre at best her classes can be fun and are very easy however her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects she can be pretty rude and allow food in the classroom aside of water she is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later overall i got a highly b
4579,Edith  Hays,get ready to deal with an old moody lady with a bad temper she can be super sweet and nice once you turn around she is a completely different person she disrespects students like if they were year olds even think about skipping class
4580,Edith  Hays,is very rude focus too much on irreverent things even teach she just reads off the handouts call you out if chewing gum or eating food which is very childish if another teacher teaching this class take it horrible teacher
4581,Edith  Hays,class seems easy attendance and edmodo count a lot does not allow food gum cell phones nor drinks in the classroom not even if its a long period other than that class is not that bad her tests can be hard but if you look over the chapter and notes test should not be too hard she would send out a review for the test pretty helpful
4582,Edith  Hays,sassiest professor ever had no drinks or food other than water but over all her class was pretty easy if you show up do her daily reflections and follow her syllabus to the dot lot of papers to keep up with i ended up dividing mine by week in a binder
4583,Edith  Hays,she is one of the rudest professors i have ever taken she will not let you eat or drink in class unless from a water bottle no sodas or coffee she goes over activities in class but her tests are nothing like what she goes over she will call you out if caught on your phone or talking while she is talking beware of her
4584,Edith  Hays,easy if you pay attention she teaches based on application not content expect things you know to be on the test she grades easy but it is the tests that will get you make a study group quizlet helps immensely with this class sweet lady but not the nicest of people and will treat class as if it is an elementary school classroom
4585,Edith  Hays,incredibly rude and disrespectful towards students and other adults this is a university not an elementary classroom
4586,Edith  Hays,mrs hays is a very sweet lady she seems to genuinely care about everyone and wants you to do well however she does get annoyed if you are talking to someone while she is no food or cell phone allowed in class she will literally call you out just be respectful and pay attention you will receive an easy a
4587,Edith  Hays,she was a delight i loved this class so much and she offered so much help assignments are easy ff you do them right you will get full credit she is a tough grader when it comes to tests though just be sure to study
4588,Edith  Hays,professor hays was delightful never did i have an issue with her or teaching method hays was strict but fair mandatory attendance if you pay attention to the details you will for sure pass her exams beware though her exams do become a bit harder hays can be rude sometimes but many overlooked it i would take her again made an
4589,Edith  Hays,very sweet lady but beware her exams are kinda hard you put things into your own words it has to be exactly what she says or she will count it wrong
4590,Edith  Hays,mrs hays is very sweet yes she is oldschool where not allowed to have drinks in the class but she wants you to pass she provides much much extra credit if you show trying love her good lady classes are easy tests are hard if you study
4591,Edith  Hays,tests are hard and every single point counts only point different in an a and a b i was points from an a and she would not pump me up and i was at every single class strict but i would take her again just follow her review and study hard
4592,Cynthia  Maguire,professor maguire is a smart and kind person she goes above and beyond her everyday teaching responsibilities to make sure every student is successful during the semester but she is not a pushover
4593,Cynthia  Maguire,her lectures were long and boring talks wayy too much class is optional but be there for labs to pass test were online but we probably ruined that for future classes be prepare to spend on the book for homework finally be prepare for lengthy homework which includes readings and multiple choice questions
4594,Cynthia  Maguire,labs are easy but if you show up you get a if there its hard to fail lots of the lab material along with a minute video every week has to be done outside of class
4595,Cynthia  Maguire,probably one of the hardest classes taken so far had to fight to barely make an a only consists of quizzes and lab reports and both are of final grade quizzes are super tough lab reports are easy if you go by the labmanual required good professor but ta does most the work tough lab overall get different professor if you can
4596,Cynthia  Maguire,she is never there and does not help much the quizzes are very hard and hurt your grade i would not take her class unless you absolutely have to
4597,Cynthia  Maguire,she is not a good teacher
4598,Cynthia  Maguire,she is very passionate about the topics but more like she is trying to convince you to be passionate about it rather than teaches you about the topic she will ask you questions that no one knows the answers to because we gone over it and then expects us to know the answer
4599,Cynthia  Maguire,do not take this class from her if you do not have too she is not helpful her quizzes are very hard she will tell you to study the lab reports for the quizzes but then there will be things on the quiz that on the lab reports always follow her directions because she will take points off for everything
4600,Cynthia  Maguire,take her unless you can teach yourself outside of class a terrible teacer plus her monotone in sigh not the best teacher
4601,Cynthia  Maguire,she did not have grades uploaded on blackboard until the semester was over she told us weeks before school let out that we could make up assignments but at the time i had all then i look on after the semester ends and shes added lots of grades that are like and would have done some of that make up work if those grades we uploaded
4602,Cynthia  Maguire,ms maguire was great i took intro and she explained the material well she is obviously passionate about the subject and her enthusiasm made it interesting it is possible to do well if you do all assignments plus practice problems
4603,Cynthia  Maguire,she was an okay teacher the only thing i had a problem with was that i received an and she even make it an a which i thought was a little ridiculous considering it is only points and she would not round it up considering other teachers would raise your grade a whole point to give you an a she even round it up
4604,Cynthia  Maguire,very clear and tells students all expectations she offers office credit extra worksheets ungraded practice homework and even sends links for websites and youtube videos the most clear professor ever if you get a good grade in this course it is because you did not study or learn the material period great
4605,Cynthia  Maguire,i had to teach myself a lot of the time her tests are really hard because she teaches straight off of the powerpoint the online sapling homework helps a little with understanding material but i think i would recommend her she care to help you pass if your failing
4606,Cynthia  Maguire,she provides many opportunities for advancement in the class if you show up to class and study there should be no problem for you to make a good grade
4607,Cynthia  Maguire,a stickler about everything not the one teaching but she does drop in regularly watch your videos she quizes on them and also make sure you go pick up your previous quizes she reuses material
4608,Cynthia  Maguire,she seems like a really sweet lady but is one of the toughest teachers ever i basically had to teach myself everything and her deadlines are super early attendance is mandatory and she is speaks in a monotone voice which makes the class more of a bore i do not recommend her
4609,Cynthia  Maguire,this class was very boring and she was trying to go over everything without any clarification she was so focused on getting it done rather than making sure we actually learned the material
4610,Cynthia  Maguire,great class i really enjoyed attending took the summer course and ms maguire is an amazing teacher really enjoyed her lectures as long as you focus and study awesome
4611,Cynthia  Maguire,this woman is a terrible teacher she teaches directly off of her powerpoints but she even know the material the first test is material from high school and is easy but after that i never made higher than a the final is a state exam super easy i know how but i made an a
4612,Julia  Scott,julia is a very smart professor who knows what talking about however she know how to explain concepts properly especially for harder accounting classes afa she goes really quickly through the course materials which leads you to major confusion and she really show you how to write good cases but expects you to be good
4613,Julia  Scott,awesome professor lots to learn but make sure you attend class exams are pretty tough but definitely fair would highly recommend
4614,Julia  Scott,basically the boss in accounting department might intimidate you at first then you realized she just have time for nonsense and casual talking her slides are informative but notes are strongly recommended because i found it a bit difficult to figure it out if i missed the class good luck
4615,Julia  Scott,hands down one of the best professors ever had very clear and concise extremely helpful and passionate about what she teaches do not hesitate to take her
4616,Julia  Scott,wish i could take her for all accounting courses
4617,Julia  Scott,excellent teacher common midterm for all sections and all her sections had the highest average her slides are super clear and so is her method of teacher would def take for intro to accounting
4618,Julia  Scott,although she clearly cares a tonne for her students the teaching method can be a bit confusing if you want to learn help you learn the midterm material perfectly because you have time to finish the exam hr exam in hrs i actually would recommend her as she is reasonable caring and available for meeting
4619,Julia  Scott,really awesome and nice professor she is so organized and prepared and she really cares about her students but watch out for the midterm
4620,Julia  Scott,most consistent organized helpful and clear teacher had this semester would definitely recommend
4621,Julia  Scott,prof scott is supposedly one of the most qualified accounting professors however her ability to explain things such as pension plans is limited and her slides are not very clear and useful for exam review be sure to master fundamental accounting materials before taking her class
4622,Julia  Scott,professor scott really knows her stuff her exams and assignments are challenging but fair one of the better accounting profs a class quiz two case studies midterm and final make sure you know how to write a proper case as it makes up for half of your mark on the exams recommend her but have to do work to keep up
4623,Julia  Scott,great great professor she seems cold at first but she is a very to the point no crap woman she is very helpful when you ask questions and is grateful to those who come to class and participate the class is not easy but shes great
4624,Julia  Scott,quite interesting thought process exam are often tricky
4625,Julia  Scott,very knowledgeable good pace
4626,Julia  Scott,she is awful you will not understand anything from her lectures you will only sleep
4627,Julia  Scott,best teacher ive had all my time mcgill i have taken her for intro and intermediate and now take her for intermediate she her stuff very well extremely helpful and knowledgeable in subject matter highly recommended do your stuff and practice exercises and no reason for you to do poorly amazing teacher
4628,Julia  Scott,for intermediate fin shes solid knows her stuff goes at a good pace and exams are fair she preps you well for the exams
4629,Julia  Scott,a bit boring but the exams are very representative of what we see in class
4630,Julia  Scott,i had her for mgcr211 and mgcr351 and taking her for mgcr352 everything she says in class is clear and she gives real examples related from her work experience it is true that the exams were hard but it was hard for everyone even ppl who did not take her so just the way the profs make the exams and not way to teach
4631,Julia  Scott,so i heard amazing things about this prof before taking the class but she was actually not that great i find that she was sometimes all over the place and not very organized also not very approachable the exams were not representative of the material learned in class and they were brutal especially the final still managed to get a good grade
4632,Alan  Cavaiola,have had him for several classes study the power point and you will get an a but know it inside and out he is a wonderful caring professor who will go out of his way to explain things sometimes he seems a little annoyed if you ask too many questions but he always is willing to answer them you get out of class early
4633,Alan  Cavaiola,terrible instructor
4634,Alan  Cavaiola,took dr c for psychopathology and he was incredible he definitely easy but you learn a lot and he is extremely helpful and insightful also been my advisor and been awesome in that regard as well highly recommend taking him if willing to work hard want to learn
4635,Alan  Cavaiola,really knowledgeable helpful and approachable but if the type who a fan of tests and exams you will have a hard time
4636,Alan  Cavaiola,dr cavaiola is extremely knowledgeable and is a great communicator he makes the class interesting and insightful he also goes out of his way for students who need help he is a seasoned and fun professor who is a fair and honest grader
4637,Alan  Cavaiola,dr caviola seems nice until he gets stressed then you will see his other side students be fooled
4638,Alan  Cavaiola,dr cavaiola is an amazing professor had him for psychopathology and he is the only professor you want for this class he is very clear class is entertaining and he has a wealth of information if you need help all you need to do is ask
4639,Alan  Cavaiola,i had dr cavaiola for classespsychopathology marriage and family he is not easy but the best professor to take if you want to learn a lot his classes are fun and interesting and he is very professional and fair he is the epitome of what a professor should be
4640,Alan  Cavaiola,i think he needs to encourage classroom interactions within peers and teacherstudent as well since the subject is psychopathology for counseling
4641,Alan  Cavaiola,not good goes into rages when stressed be careful
4642,Alan  Cavaiola,prof cavaiola was one of my favorites i had him for crisis intervention and i was never bored his stories were always interesting and the material bad i wish i could take him for another class

4653,Chris  Husbands,great teacher easy exams just study his powerpoints and you will pass with an a the lab quizzes are pretty tough but the biology department makes those you need a book and he will tell not to buy the recommended book

4663,Desmond  Harding,prof harding is an amazing professor the content of the class was pretty tough and he did an amazing job teaching it to us be prepared to read and write there were about novels we had to read for this course show up and show him that you care and you will be fine
4664,Desmond  Harding,this class was alright but sometimes he was rude to students in class the papers were a challenge and the take home exams were no breeze i would not take him again
4665,Desmond  Harding,great guy makes a boring subject fun and is probably one of the nicest professors on campus
4666,Desmond  Harding,as an english major i absolutely adored dr harding his classes were intellectually stimulating and i always felt challenged to understand literature in a more indepth way dr harding offers students the opportunity to revise papers gives students incredible feedback and makes his class very interactive
4667,Desmond  Harding,prof harding is funny and personable he grades a little tough but gives you the rubric before hand so you know what going to be graded on he put almost any grades in bb until the very end of the semester so hard to know how doing in the class he is a fun professor and tries to make things interesting
4668,Desmond  Harding,harding is definitely one of the better english profs on campus he is extremely intelligent and his english accent bad to listen to either he really appreciates when his students go to him for help and participate in class went to his office hours once for help on a presentation and he guided me through the whole thing go to class
4669,Desmond  Harding,i really enjoyed professor class really funny and easy going there are only exams midterm final from what i can remember and both take home there is one presentation but it is with a partner and its super easy he has one short paper pages and one long paper pages this is an easy class to get a wi credit
4670,Desmond  Harding,he is a great prof his assignments are not always the clearest but is really willing to work with you he makes class fun i would recommend taking him for your english class
4671,Desmond  Harding,for a class with freshman nonenglish majors the class was rough he expects a lot from his students and you have to work to improve your grade there was little substantive feedback on the essays and in class the classes were more discussion based he expected us to comprehend and work at the level of juniors or seniors
4672,Desmond  Harding,i really enjoyed having this class with des a really smart guy and interesting to hear everything he has to say he always seemed to care about us as students and our opinions you could tell he wanted us to be successful sort of a quirky guy so not everybody liked him no such thing as a perfect paper
4673,Desmond  Harding,as inspirational as he is hilarious and one of the few people to truly challenge my writing capacities i went to him for advice on an assignment topic and he provided me with a mini lecture on the subject his lectures might seem vague but he prefers to generate thought rather than telling you what to think
4674,Desmond  Harding,at times dr harding can be a little all over the place he is really interested in his teaching though and he really wants to motivate and excite his students as well he is a very nice guy and is always willing to talk and help his students he does grade a bit touch and there are quite a few assignments overall though not a bad class
4675,Desmond  Harding,absolutely awful experience in the class i always felt as if i was drowning and he did little to help when i asked questions he has a way of giving you an answer without actually answering anything and leaving you more confused than when you asked the question in the first place
4676,Desmond  Harding,des knows his stuff and he expects you to work hard he once told me he thinks of himself like a captain of a ship whose sole mission is to get from point a to point b the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester and if he loses some crew members along the way so be it hilarious chill guy if you get to know him a little
4677,Desmond  Harding,dr harding was always willing to help me and pushed me to do my best i appreciate him so much he was nothing but kind and generous with his time i loved the novels we read too
4678,Desmond  Harding,how does this man have such a high rating always unclear about what he wanted totally abstract in his lectures held us to grad school standards grading standards made absolutely no sense and showed very inappropriate video clips and mocked anyone who was uncomfortable with it did everything a good teacher would never do would not recommend
4679,Desmond  Harding,dr harding is one of the best professors ever had intelligent funny and he cares about his students
4680,Desmond  Harding,worst professor ever had ridiculous amount of expected reading unclear directions for every assignment and very harsh grading a nice guy but he does meet you at your level he acts as if everyone has read the texts as much as he has he just read off a piece of paper and care if you were learning or not i learned nothing
4681,Desmond  Harding,he is a very creative professor loved his lectures there is a lot of reading but all the novels are completely worth reading highly suggest him
4682,Desmond  Harding,at first the class seems great humorous discussionbased but entertainment can only disguise the lack of content for so long his arrogance and sarcasm cross the line from enjoyable to inappropriate instructions are oftentimes long and confusing if you want to actually learn take harding overall an extremely frustrating experience
4683,Ed  Giardina,awesome class because of instructor would have taken advanced courses had they offered them as night courses instructed by ed i put off taking this class sorry i did should have taken it sooner
4684,Ed  Giardina,ed ed ed ed i loved this class and not only because he was sexy he actually was passionate about the subject matter and he helped clarify already instilled opinions i had i can easily say this is one of the best teachers at aicoc outside of core or lab classes i would probably take the class again if i had the money x
4685,Ed  Giardina,he definelty inspired me
4686,Ed  Giardina,best teacher at aicaoc in my opinion he is very big on concept and will help you become a better designer you should take at least one of his classes before you graduate
4687,Ed  Giardina,no comments
4688,Ed  Giardina,amazing teacher always willing to go beyond requirements and is so inspiring
4689,Ed  Giardina,this class requires the teacher to help create your preception of art form and design ed does this wonderfully and find yourself wanting to have a conversation with him
4690,Ed  Giardina,a crazy teacher with a weird way of expressing himself but a great guy and im glad to have had him
4691,Ed  Giardina,energetic passionate instructor he is great to have discussions with especially if you disagree with his viewpoint he loves the discussions which is why we always ran behind didnt give grades on homework just credit which was a nice change
4692,Ed  Giardina,one of the good teachers definite must take as a teacher for any one of his classes
4693,Ed  Giardina,no comments
4694,Ed  Giardina,ed is very helpful and is always trying to better his classes although this class reiterates principles of design it puts them in a very subjective light dont be afraid to have very strong opinions but also dont be afraid to listen to other arguements this is a very interactive class
4695,Ed  Giardina,ed is wise beyond his years in the art field great guy and a great teacher
4696,Ed  Giardina,i am mad as hell and not going to take it anymore
4697,Ed  Giardina,one cool hot guy
4698,Ed  Giardina,ed is great i felt that this class was a little basic for him and would like to have a more advanced class with him he is extremely knowledgable and has the crudentials
4699,Ed  Giardina,i disagree he is clear he knows the material sometimes he presents too much info more than most teachers
4700,Ed  Giardina,a nice guy but unclear a lot of the time wish you could get the same out of other teachers though has very good ideas
4701,Ed  Giardina,very nice teacher
4702,Ed  Giardina,hot
4703,Jim  Slowiak,jim is one if the greatest professors i have ever met a true mensch he cares deeply about theatre so much so that even if you have a limited knowledge of theatre he engages you to constantly do more to grow your knowledge is fed by the true genius of the mans knowledge he invites the best of the best to come in to do workshops take his classes
4704,Jim  Slowiak,great guy horrible professor he would be a great professor for students not taking an intro course he is very unclear in his expectations and has major mood swings kicked whole class out twice for things we have no control over probably the reason the theatre department is not strong at ua would take as a sr but maybe not as a fresh or soph
4705,Jim  Slowiak,the way jim teaches theatre is outside the mainstream and focuses the actor as an organic empty vessel the work is challenging and puts the attention on the others and on the space rather than on the ego this way of working is for actors who want to let go of the blocks that are holding them back from being in the present
4706,Jim  Slowiak,as a professor although he was really out there i appreciatd jim for opening my eyes to a different style of theatre however as a graduate advisor he has failed us miserably he respond to emails or look over drfts simply complaining too busy
4707,Jim  Slowiak,one of the best acting classes taken jim really makes you think outside the box and will always take the time to help you out in a pinch the class has no real homework except for two partner scenes and one monologue overall a great class
4708,Jim  Slowiak,taking theater at the college level is like going to kindergarten with a phd this professor makes no attempt to change this stigma he is more concerned with showing how good he thinks he is than teaching the basics of good performance this class does not prepare students for the vocal talent it takes to perform on stage
4709,Jim  Slowiak,his classes were challenging and interesting if you show up and do the work you can earn a fair grade i felt inspired by his passion and dedication to the theatre when he is pleased or when he finds something interesting his face lights up
4710,Jim  Slowiak,no comments
4711,Jim  Slowiak,jim slowiak is one of the best teachers had at the university of akron i learned more about acting technique in one semester from him than any other professor in my six years at akron his views are different but worth experiencing
4712,Jim  Slowiak,jim is very demanding and expects you to give at all times he is also extremely helpful and makes time to help you if you ask for it also if you get a good grade in his class you have earned it his ideas are a bit out there for the mainstream but keep an open mind and make it
4713,Jim  Slowiak,no comments
4714,Jim  Slowiak,concepts apply to real world boring and full of himself
4715,Lynn  Mattie,i wish she was still at el centro i miss her and they need her here she is the best instructor they had here
4716,Lynn  Mattie,chef mattie is mean likes to make fun of students also has favorites and if you not one of them can make your life miserable
4717,Lynn  Mattie,she knows her material and she wants her students to succeed
4718,Lynn  Mattie,one of the best teachers i have had at el cnetro
4719,Lynn  Mattie,in my opinion chef mattie not in favor of blacks im white and said a lot of things in front of me about minority students
4720,Lynn  Mattie,wow i cant believe people like her she is an awesome teacher and buy what people say you will learn a lot from very clear of what she teaches shes very understanding and very straight forward i had fun in her class and she is one of my favorite teachers out there
4721,Lynn  Mattie,best teacher ever my fav always watching out for me and always there for me always in my heart and on my mind
4722,Lynn  Mattie,the bigest problem with her is that she picks her favorites and if you are not one of her favorites you are the the earth and she makes it very clear to everyone what your social status is along with grades she will give you tests but you will never know what your grade is because she forgets to grade them
4723,Lynn  Mattie,the worst teacher i have ever had always leaves the class and has too many favorites does not teach what we need to learn in a bakery class you are only as good as what the teacher teaches
4724,Lynn  Mattie,she is an amazing teacher
4725,Lynn  Mattie,no comments
4726,Lynn  Mattie,no comments
4727,Lynn  Mattie,no comments
4728,Lynn  Mattie,i believe the head of the baking department she is so far behind everyone else no imagination no energy does not challenge her students shows favorites take another instructor
4729,Lynn  Mattie,she is not a chef she does not have enough professional experience to teach her degree is in gossips about her students i would never take another class from her again i feel sorry for her students they will be handicapped
4730,Lynn  Mattie,she is a great teacher patient with students knowledgeable and friendly
4731,Lynn  Mattie,if liked you will receive help if not drop and find a new class she was very nice to me her best quality but she cannot bake unfamiliar with products for a former bakery owner the same products are repeated throughout the semester rehash
4732,Therese  Lueck,be prepared to fight for mediocrity unless you are on her good side i took this class after i took editing so i knew a fair amount about ap style and news but she refuses to give good grades if you are a comms major who likes to kiss up you might do well english majors beware would not recommend at all no help extra effort does not matter
4733,Therese  Lueck,true she does expect you to be a newswriter at the start of class she really teach you anything and then when you ask for help she tells you to look it up be prepared to write in your book and bring it everyday to class she is nice though
4734,Therese  Lueck,i really enjoyed this professor she was very open and honest in discussions i can tell she enjoys sharing her extensive knowledge if i had her class sooner i considering changing my major she grades fair and challenges students to do their best she really had a positive impact on my life by what i learned
4735,Therese  Lueck,tough grader but very fair she knows her stuff for sure and will help you out if you seek it
4736,Therese  Lueck,what a horrible prof she expects everyone to be news writers and does take in consideration other majors she is extremely condescending and passiveaggresive she expects you to know all news writing terms even if they have not been discussed before we spent the first six weeks discussing story ideas and did not do much else bad bad bad bad
4737,Therese  Lueck,she is extremely condescending and that impairs her teaching ability incredibly difficult to please especially if not on her good side her lectures helpful and are extremely repetitive she ever help you with your actual writing
4738,Therese  Lueck,dr lueck expects wellwritten papers i took this in the summer and i was the only graduate student lots of reading and writing but passable she had a lot of feedback on my paper but i got an a she is enthusiastic about her subject and lectures a lot if you read the text and participate be fine
4739,Therese  Lueck,she may be a little unclear but if you as for help she will help you she does lecture a lot and can get a little redundant but i like her just work hard and she will notice
4740,Therese  Lueck,i had this teacher for news writing she grades way too hard for students who are just learning news writing i was extremely interested in news writing and been on my high school newspaper staff and the editor of it still got on papers i turned in says she lecture much opposite is true
4741,Therese  Lueck,i had her for newswriting and she is very unclear and tests are over too much information to even study for most assignments seem unplanned and on the spot most days there are no power points provided and basically on your own i do not recommend this teacher if truly interested in news writing and enhancing your skills
4742,Therese  Lueck,horrible horrible horrible once this teacher has it out for you do not ever plan on passing her class
4743,Therese  Lueck,wow she is the most unclear professor ever had she expects everyone to grow up and be a professional journalist for the new york times she grades very hard and unfair never expect a on homework bother asking for her help she give it to you she is overall insane and should not be teaching dont take a class with her
4744,Therese  Lueck,overall she is a decent teacher but there are some problems she is unclear about what she expects from assignments her grading system is harsh as she grades people as though they are professionals also she tends to babble quite a bit and talks endlessly however she is very nice and approachable and is willing to help when needed
4745,Therese  Lueck,the teacher was overall nice but she expects everyone in the class to be going into a journalist field and as such grades quite harshly if you have a strong opinion of your own writing chances are it will be gone by the time done with this class take another english writing class to offset this if this happens
4746,Therese  Lueck,she teaches in a high school style she tends to be unclear yet unrelenting while grading
4747,Therese  Lueck,this should have been a fun and interesting class but therese lueck more or less had me think i write anymore fortunately regained my confidence and continue writing do not take this class
4748,Therese  Lueck,did not learn anything by taking her class tell you that writing is improving and then give you a on five straight assignments definitely would not reccomend her to anyone
4749,Therese  Lueck,condescending
4750,Therese  Lueck,if she like how your writing style your grade will reflect that assumes all students are future journalists does not have much knowledge on how to effectively teach a class but knows a lot of real world journalism very nice though
4751,Therese  Lueck,no comments
4752,Annie  Gilson,tied for best professor after credits of classes she will never have you read anything that extremely useful ask for much but always challenges you can be abrasiveprepare for tough lovebut you will grow very experienced pass her classes up if you want to learn to write better this is my class with her
4753,Annie  Gilson,wonderful professor generous with her time cares about students gives honest helpful feedback knows her stuff one of my favorite classes at ou
4754,Annie  Gilson,i had prof gilson for a workshopstyle class being a published author herself she understands how to balance supporting the work while still pushing them outside of their comfort zone to help find their inner voice if you are serious about your writing want honest feedback in a creative setting prof class is ideal
4755,Annie  Gilson,she is a wonderful professor fun and slapstick but is not someone to take advantage of she knows her stuff and she wants to help all her students learn and succeed with their writing goals
4756,Annie  Gilson,where to start annie is the best i honestly owe so much of my academic and personal growth to her she takes time both in class and out of class to make sure her students are okay and understand everything supportive fun amazing love her mentor teacher supporter speaks her mind and supports you for doing the same favorite prof ever
4757,Annie  Gilson,weird but in a good way read a lot in her capstone but a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere a professor that really truly engages with what she reads and works hard to make sure everyone is just as excited about the novels some work but one of the most memorable classes taken here
4758,Annie  Gilson,gilson is hands down one of the best professors i have taken at ou so far and this class even for my she is so inspirational hilarious and down right fantastic expect to write duh but have tons of fun while doing it she legitimately made me think i chose the wrong major for myself just because of how interested i became
4759,Annie  Gilson,she is really passionate about what she does she treats students like her peers and is really open about everything go to the lectures even though not mandatory if you go and pay attention the written exams will feel like a breeze she makes you read some stories but you also watch movies too
4760,Annie  Gilson,i took prof gilson because i read her rate my professor reviews and they seemed good i hard a very hard time in her class that i ended up dropping her class weeks into the semester i missed class and she would not give me any notes or tell me what we discussed she only grades based on exams and participation
4761,Annie  Gilson,been an incredible mentor for not only me but many others she keeps her students in mind and updates on possible internshipsjobeducational opportunities she has your back if you put the effort ingrades on development listen to her advice and always ask questions be afraid to speak up handsdown the best professor at ou
4762,Annie  Gilson,around and movies one of which you read and are to read up to a certain point in the story and then it is discussed in class she gives you a set of essay questions on each reading of which will appear on the exam and you pick one to write on along with passage ids from the stories parts you identify and explain
4763,Annie  Gilson,the course starts of hard and gets easier as the semester goes on by design you finish up by watching and analyzing movies attendance is not mandatory but she keeps track of it for participation read read read and come to class to succeed bs will not work on exams as she can see right through it bring texts to class in order to follow along
4764,Annie  Gilson,loved this class kind of started off with difficult reading material but gets way easier as the semester goes on she does this on purpose very engaging and funny makes class interesting attendence not mandatory but she passes a sheet for participation very easy and fun class easy to pass but if you dont read the material she will know
4765,Annie  Gilson,best professor ever funny fun great discussions explians material well and very helpful this class is challenging but no one learns anything from easy classes not that much reading analyze movies at end of semester i looked forward to class knows all her students her enthusiasm made me more excited to be a english minor
4766,Annie  Gilson,annie is a great professor very educated helpful and willing to read your papers and cope together to improve your style of writing there is too much reading in this class more than books in a limited time if you are an advocate in the world of contemporary english novels you will be fine.read and share your ideas be okay
4767,Annie  Gilson,prof gilson is one of those rare professors who takes pride in what she does she is by far the most enthusiastic prof ever had and agree the first time you have class with her her lectures are very interesting and keep your attention the exams can be difficult but only if you do the reading and attend class great prof
4768,Annie  Gilson,best professor i have ever had period i loved coming to this class and always found myself drawn into the discussion gilson is incredibly intelligent and has a lot to share if you let her her personality is very bold but i found that to be a good thing you can rewrite anything and she is flexible so you have every opportunity to do well
4769,Annie  Gilson,very nice and extremely funny show for class and ask questions will give you a easy a on participation and take notes very helpful on exams buy all the book needed some of the stories are online so you can just print them and exams a pretty easy if you pay attention in class which you will cause she is so much fun
4770,Annie  Gilson,she is brutally honest when it comes to critiquing work so at first i was afraid she would be a hard grader i found her critiques to be helpful and her grading fair and even a little generous she is opinionated but tolerant of opinions if you prefer the standard lecture class not the professor for you
4771,Annie  Gilson,she is one of my favorite professors ever hilarious honest fun and intelligent she loves to teach and wants her students to succeed if you do the reading and answer the exam questions beforehand do great i highly recommend taking her before you graduate from ou oh and her class gets easier as the semester progresses awesome
4772,Alexander  McClung,loved him hes a great guy and is very supportive and is more than willing to help if you need it he really knows his stuff and hes very intelligent overall an awesome teacher
4773,Alexander  McClung,very nice guy tries to help you knows almost everyones name presents material well is always prepared tests are fair offers extra credit really easy to get an a if you go to class take notes because there is no textbook
4774,Alexander  McClung,a pretty easy grade the lecture can get boring but its important to go to every class and take notes bc there is no textbook study your notes before the test and be fine do the extra credit too its easy and boosts your grade
4775,Alexander  McClung,he was a really great teacher the lectures got a little boring sometimes but you could understand what he was talking about the test ridiculously easy take notes and know what talking about guaranteed at least a b the readings also a bit dry in the beginning but not a necessity to pass the class overall a good teacher and class
4776,Alexander  McClung,this guy is great the lectures tend to e dry but hes very helpfula nd hell do anything he an to help u pass tests are difficult but reports are simple worth taking just try and stay awake
4777,Alexander  McClung,he was a really nice younger guy who knows what he is talking about i really enjoyed the class he is really helpful and very clear hes also really cute
4778,Alexander  McClung,best instructor i had at newpaltz very supportive clear and helpful
4779,Marilyn  Rose,dr rose is a nice person who loves what she does but she is not good at teaching a large class she goes through slides too quickly not caring if people are still writing the stories she chooses are strange and the assignments are unclear i take another class taught by her
4780,Marilyn  Rose,topnotch professor brilliant and engaging a privilege to study under her
4781,Marilyn  Rose,she is very passionate however hard to pay attention to she does not like differing opinions but she will not give you a bad mark based on disagreement you can expect to do a lot of work in her class essays a lot of readings for each class and a closing assignment she might be better in the morning than she is in the evening overall nice
4782,Marilyn  Rose,one of the finest profs brock has not an easy prof but passionate committed and dedicated you will learn so much from this woman i would take another course from her in a heartbeat
4783,Marilyn  Rose,meh okay
4784,Marilyn  Rose,simply the best gonna get

4793,Marilyn  Rose,great prof
4794,Marilyn  Rose,an amazing professor very softspoken genteel woman wellread open able to talk intelligently and knowledgably about everything on top of all of that a wonderful person too
4795,Kay  Bishop,the class does not prepare students to be a librarian instead it is full of continuous book and multimedia evaluations will learn more working with a librarian than taking this class this class is not taught but rather constructed from a text book
4796,Kay  Bishop,online class professor extremely helpful provided guidance and clarity of assignments when sought by student
4797,Kay  Bishop,too nit picky she does try humiliate you over email to the whole class she wrote on the announcements page i was pleased with all your assignments except for one student which was me that was really unnecessary gets mad when i use commas comma splice but then when i use commas its a runon sentence like really which one is it
4798,Kay  Bishop,dr bishop personifies the failings of the ub program she does not teach instead relies on rudimentary handouts with questionable value her grade scale defies explanation
4799,Kay  Bishop,a lot of work for an online class
4800,Kay  Bishop,another bad prof wish pick a better text than her own mediocre publication wish get replaced
4801,Kay  Bishop,crap teacher give her textbook away on amazon too bad we have used a better text
4802,Kay  Bishop,awful not helpful and quite condescending might want to examine where her paychecks come from her students
4803,Kay  Bishop,very unprofessional will publicly humiliate you over email to other professors not a decent woman in general
4804,Kay  Bishop,oh where to start with this lady she seems very helpful and wants to know if you have any questions but when you ask a question she acts like you are stupid for asking also she rambles on for ever on stupid stuff she also the easiest grader
4805,James  Allard,nice man makes accommodations tough marker
4806,James  Allard,great lecturer tough grader
4807,James  Allard,dr allard is very funny and very engaging even as a hard marker he cares about his students and is very helpful everything you would want in a professor is in dr allard he is not only good at teaching but also good at communicating what he wants from students his marking is difficult but very challenging and helps students learn and grow
4808,James  Allard,i thought that professor allard was awesome he is an excellent speaker which made lectures interesting and engaging this was my first english class in university and he made sure that the students understood clearly what was expected of them and was very approachable if you had any questions i am always looking for more of his classes to take
4809,James  Allard,the first few lectures i was wowed with his lecturing ability but this wore off as i realized he said the same thing over and over and over again i also do not think that his course was well described in the description on line the readings were horrible and most hard to understand all he talks about storytelling every lecture the whole time
4810,James  Allard,held amazing lectures and let you know exactly what you need to do to pass the course though he is a tough marker the lecture material definitely had the potential to be boring but allard made everything interesting and fun
4811,James  Allard,some of the most entertaining lectures i have ever attended the lectures are largely optional most of your grades come from your essays and seminar participation which is graded by your ta on essay if its late policy having a good ta in this course in crucial if your ta is giving you low grades switch seminars or drop the course
4812,James  Allard,dr lectures were very engaging and he truly wants all of his students to be successful i hope to be able to take more of dr classes in the future
4813,James  Allard,professor allard was a fairly solid professor you could certainly tell that he was interested in what he was teaching sometimes it was hard for me to get anything out of the lectures however because i felt some stuff he was talking about relevant and i had a hard time knowing what to write i felt that he was also a hard marker
4814,James  Allard,loved this class no previous knowledge of the course and thought it was going to be very challenging but his lectures are easy to understand and he makes the subject interesting good feedback on assignments and if you put the work in you will get a good mark
4815,James  Allard,professor allard is tough but fair he is very clear and concise in his lecture presentation and will give you all the tools and support needed to succeed while promoting academic independence
4816,James  Allard,honestly such a great professer his lectures were always funny and most of the time he would point out interesting ways to look at the novels or content we were reading always willing to help and always dropped hints for essays and exams for those who went to lecture easy exams if you went to class and listened
4817,James  Allard,best professor he keeps you intrigued with his lectures as long as you go to the lectures and seminars and put in an effort this class will not be a problem to get a good mark his exams are no surprise because he is crystal clear with what he wants you to know
4818,James  Allard,amazing professor it was an honour to be taught by dr allard it is clear that he is passionate about what he teaches he is very clear in the way that he teaches and there is no room for misunderstanding visited him during his office hour and even outside of lecture he is very helpful excellent professor
4819,James  Allard,nothing like what i heard the course was like just turned into sonnets and reviews essays are marked extremely hard and you encouraged to think for yourself you just tell him what he wants to hear i felt very confined in the class and unable to express individual thoughts on the texts very unimpressed
4820,James  Allard,loved him but found that the class was more like a lit theory class as opposed to romantic lit some readings are very dry you really have to force yourself to get into them although he does a very good job of making the readings clear and interesting my lowest mark in university i only just passed and worked very hard but still loved allard
4821,James  Allard,amazing lecturer one of the best at brock for sure enthusiastic knowledgeable and injects a lot of humour into his lectures fairness is another question not saying impossible to get a good mark in his class but i will say that be disappointed not the most helpful outside of class and class averages are abysmal audit
4822,James  Allard,i love allard had him every semester since second year and i have learned a lot from him i think super helpful when it comes to office hours but easy to make yourself look silly in front of him great prof great lectures
4823,James  Allard,been part of the allard fanclub since first year utterly fantastic he walks in lecture and holds the place spellbound for the next minutes he has deep knowledge and passion for his subject matter and absolutely hilarious you truly been in an english class until had allard
4824,James  Allard,very disappointing he tries to fit too many books into the course and fails to discuss them in enough detail dont count on him taking any sort of personal interest in his students
4825,Angela  Mills,great prfessor very helpful in the transition to university
4826,Angela  Mills,i heart mills the best prof at brock university absolutely brilliant
4827,Angela  Mills,brilliant what can i say brilliant and an inspiration
4828,Angela  Mills,dr mills is an amazing professor she is very approachable and is willing to help any student who approaches her whether they have a question about an assignment or a personal problem
4829,Angela  Mills,not a fan
4830,Angela  Mills,great prof very approachable interesting
4831,Angela  Mills,i love her best prof in the university so much fun so approachable soo great never had a prof that compares i want to take every course that she teaches love her love her love her

4833,Angela  Mills,angela is awesome she makes english to intresting and explains everything is such a manner that everything makes sense
4834,Angela  Mills,wow this prof is smart she knows so much about everything which makes her lectures easy to understand she is extremely fair and very approachable
4835,Angela  Mills,awesome prof she makes american lit so much fun
4836,Angela  Mills,not a fan of american literature however now a fan of professor mills excellent teacher
4837,Angela  Mills,no comments
4838,Frank  Mitchell,hes very rude and talks nonsense to the whole class he gives out answers but changes the subject too much i feel like i am not getting the proper learning i should be getting hes worse by far i dont understand how hes an easy class of does not teach but talk useless information i am trying to get a career here
4839,Frank  Mitchell,he gives bonus points every test plus extra credit constantly you have to show up but if you do youll get the extra credit constantly tells nutty stories
4840,Frank  Mitchell,he is very easy going the class is not boring he helps you to get a good mark
4841,Frank  Mitchell,amazing professor first day of class he said he has and it definitely shows he lecture word for word from the book but uses his real life experiences to teach us he is hilarious and kind super easy course and a joy to be taught by him if you have a chance take him
4842,Frank  Mitchell,lectures about himself unbelievable stories guy is stuck in the literally show up for our final easy a if you show up but if your paying out of pocket not from financial aid or mommy and daddy i was hoping to learn more very outdated teaching style if your taking for credits go for it if you want to learn forget about it
4843,Frank  Mitchell,this guy is very interesting his lectures really helpful when it comes to the tests with that said he gives a lot of extra points during class so showing up is a good idea if you read the book an easy a he does have a tendency to drone on about himself but the stories are pretty funny and almost unbelievable
4844,Frank  Mitchell,interesting i sure i would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different but as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass his lectures are awesome you will learn a lot about life brilliant man
4845,Frank  Mitchell,he great definitely recommend test are easy
4846,Frank  Mitchell,dr frank mitchell is hands down the best instructor ever had the pleasure of learning from he is kind and intelligent and he cares about his students and is more than willing to make himself available and approachable he explains the material in a way that is understandable i plan on taking more of his classes in the future love him
4847,Frank  Mitchell,professor class was my college course taken in years his technique annoyed me at first but once i got the hang of his style he so bad read the book follow the syllabus and come to class and you will be fine his stories are quite literally
4848,Frank  Mitchell,this professor rambles for hours about stuff marginally related to the chapter at best selfcentered and conceited he believes no one is smarter than he really teach tells you first day to get an a read the book but also to not trust the book would not recommend overall
4849,Frank  Mitchell,this professor will teach you more than any other professor at cc he lectures for the entire class but always interesting if you have an open mind and enjoy critical thinking this is the guy for you he will willing to help and clarify anything if needed
4850,Frank  Mitchell,frank mitchell is tothepoint first day of class he tells you to get an a on the test you just read the chapter you can literally ignore everything he says and read the book and get an a he in an extremely entertaining lecturer even if he gets off track there been a test without extra credit extremely approachable and kind
4851,Frank  Mitchell,he is quite literally the best professor at cc you will learn so much from him because he afraid to tell the truth lectures are long but he is absolutely hilarious great class
4852,Frank  Mitchell,cool interesting professor
4853,Frank  Mitchell,kind of a weird class i had him for psychology and the lectures were super long at first and not much for the test was covered in class but towards the end you realize you have to show up to class except on test days and his stories and life lessons are actually really good and funny a good guy easy a
4854,Frank  Mitchell,great guy very interesting and his lectures will definitely make you reexamine everything you thought you already knew expects you to know your stuff and read the assigned chapters but he has great stories that go along with his lectures
4855,Frank  Mitchell,took psychology of death and dying with him and while it seemed to be his specialty he teaches all psychology classes and based on my experience recommend him for any class very little homework very little reading but honestly learned more from him than all other cc professors combined what a cool dude
4856,Frank  Mitchell,he is the best professor i had so far his lectures are very interesting and just read the book and pass his class very funny guy and he is very passionate and knows his stuff
4857,Frank  Mitchell,great teacher easy a if you just read your chapters must show up but you can leave or take breaks whenever tons of extra credit
4858,Erik  Carver,challenging but highly recommended makes you think somewhat out of place at a school like this
4859,Erik  Carver,very quiet very unclear very nerdy he means well this is his first year i cant say he is doing a bad job if you need clarity ask him and he will explain it
4860,Anne  MacDonald,i enjoy chef anne she is my favorite teacher her at el centro and i can tell she loves her students as well as baking she is an amazing woman and is willing to experiment new receipts with her students
4861,Anne  MacDonald,excellent instructor take the class
4862,Anne  MacDonald,no comments
4863,Anne  MacDonald,another fine instructor who also somehow seems to keep the kitchen running great knowledge of the industry and the people who run it and a nice person as well
4864,Anne  MacDonald,wide knowledge and cooking and baking easy going with students as long as they pay attention and screw up recommended
4865,Michael  Kwag,kwag is amazing one of the best classes go to class and pay attention and you will definitely easily get an a tells literally everything going to be on the midterm and finals
4866,Michael  Kwag,kwag is a very knowledgable professor his lectures are always interesting and if you are willing to work and participate in the class you can learn a lot and do very well he genuinely wants students to succeed although he may be strict at times he is always available for help
4867,Michael  Kwag,do not mess with him go to class always do the homework or your grade will be penalized make sure to read the chapters because the true or false section in his exam is worth it points avg and he takes the questions from the book if you take him for accounting you will do better overall in finance
4868,Michael  Kwag,you have to understand three things do not skip any of his classes he knows do all the assigned work when you think he hates you he he just wants you to do well his class is like a nonstopping train from the first minute until the last you have to be focused show him you care about your future and you will do fine
4869,Michael  Kwag,awful professor he is a very smart man in his field tells you everything that will be on the exam but even so the exams are incredibly difficult unfortunately i recommend taking with him so that you can get ready for his style in the questions kill as do the long problems accounting is awful with him more so
4870,Michael  Kwag,gives everything that will be on the exam in review but it is still really difficult he is a generous grader but not generous enough there is no curve
4871,Michael  Kwag,i took him for both my and good the best professor in sha just go to every class and take notes he told you what the problem will be on the exam before hand the might be a bit tricky tho i managed to got a perfect score on my last exam for he only taught the basic stuff in the textbook recommend
4872,Michael  Kwag,best professor in the world i have been incredibly fortunate to have learned accounting from him he is so intelligent go to him if you have questions about the material show that you care to work hard and succeed do those things and you will gain his respect which is critical
4873,Michael  Kwag,i had kwag years ago and still remember his classes you have to go to every class and do the work he is an outstanding professor and notices who shows up and who does not extremely smart and you will learn a lot from him more than willing to help but if you keep up with the work it will run you over
4874,Michael  Kwag,class is pretty difficult but he is such a helpful and kind professor he is always willing to help students who actively seek help he sets up afterclass tutoring every single day so there is always help available exams are pretty tough and take a firm understanding of the material not too bad though i got a on the first one
4875,Michael  Kwag,he is amazing inspirational speeches everyday just do the well actually read and understand the book and study and work hard for exams
4876,Michael  Kwag,great guy very open to helping you as long as you try go to tutoring go to class although he take attendance he notices and takes it into account do the homework show that you are trying and you will have no problem getting whatever grade you think you deserve
4877,Michael  Kwag,i know he seems intimidating easy the key to this class is to do the work people come to class prepare ie do the readings and then expect him to teach all the basics simple do the work before class challenge yourself by extra problems ask the tutor if you have questions and do fine
4878,Michael  Kwag,my stomach used to turn every day when i went into his class good luck
4879,Michael  Kwag,kwag kwag kwag wow in my year career as a student i have had perhaps one other teacher this bad this boring this hard to follow it is simple he should not be teaching period
4880,Michael  Kwag,really good teacher
4881,Michael  Kwag,his classes are tough i agree with other opinions but he is very helpful for students to understand through individual tutoring during the class all students in my class had worries about him before taking classed but they has been changed after taking classes also his personality and efforts are great
4882,Michael  Kwag,worst teacher ever
4883,Michael  Kwag,watch out not helpful rude and teaches at lightning speed dont even bother going to him for clarification on anything arbitrarily grades tests will take points off for one small error on one persons paper and points off someone elses when they got the entire thing wrong unfair hard to understand and just overall terrible
4884,Michael  Kwag,kwag was a nightmare you could not understand him and he is not interested in helping the students the worst that sha has to offer it is a shame the dean uses him as a showcase professor
4885,Bro. Joe  Burke,next to dr mcmonigle probably the best psych professor la salle has to offer i took him for abnormal psych he is so kind i found him funny he gave three or four test and one presentation assignment i got a in his class i would have received an a if i studied a little harder i strongly encourage taking him if you ever have the chance
4886,Bro. Joe  Burke,i took psych with joe in as an elective it totally changed my direction in life i became a therapist i took three more classes with him before graduation and he was by far the most interesting an informative teacher in the department
4887,Bro. Joe  Burke,hes great a funny and interesting guy his tests are tough and you have to study hes really personable though and looks out for his students well being hes really friendly and his class isnt too hard
4888,Bro. Joe  Burke,witty interesting and dynamic classes are comprehensive and challenging but worth your time and effort
4889,Bro. Joe  Burke,definately the hardest teacher had at la salle but an a is still possible for good students it was boring at times but doable really funny but plan on being there every wednesday for the entire class
4890,Bro. Joe  Burke,brother burke is a great guy make sure you work hard stay on top of things and do fine patient and always willing to help but will not do everything for you so be responsible i enjoyed his class a lot and learned so much
4891,Bro. Joe  Burke,he is awesome fun great teacher and teaches well his tests are straightforward and relatively easy if you stayed awake in class he is really cool about helping you out but you have to ask
4892,Bro. Joe  Burke,bro joe is the man his tests are a little tough but he one of the best teachers ever
4893,Bro. Joe  Burke,burke is an intelligent teacher who will teach even the most boring subjects with much personal interest an much intelligence also he is understanding and his classes as hard as they seem at first be attentive and contibute to class
4894,Roger  Holguin,professor is super easy so just show up get the midterm and final both are take home and pass with an a he gives one homework assignment due at the end of the semester and it too time consuming
4895,Roger  Holguin,he goes off topic and gets into politics he is a very successful investor and a former special operations naval officer he is an expert on making money if you want to get technical on details then take other professors but if you want to talk business in general terms then this is the professor to take
4896,Roger  Holguin,he is a little rude when he talk he is not organized it seems like he never prepare for class he just comes in and talk from his experiences after this finance class i still understand stock market he only answers question but how do i ask question when i learned anything i guess the class is for whoever already know
4897,Roger  Holguin,the teacher is a little rude and sarcastic at first but he eases up on it in the long run.easy class self taught course and collaborating with peers help you need to network with peers take home final take home midterm instructor is absent a lot but ok at the end of the class you will have answers if you ask the questions he loves qts
4898,Roger  Holguin,repeats himself every lecture hands out syllabus but doesnt follow it lectures off topic about world economy we havent used the text at all yet but from my understanding we will be tested on it so i suggest studying.i am supposed to be learning about investing in the stock and bond markets but he hasnt taught us anything yet
4899,Roger  Holguin,had him for bus and personal finance very easy class my book was hardly used except for tests lectures very helpful for tests but he does relate rl situations through experience to things in the text often absent but i forgive him from his age one of my fav prof mainly from personality esy clas teach urself if u want to lrn any
4900,Roger  Holguin,very easy long as you do your work go to the class you will do fine on the test he gives you answer before the he also give takehome quiz very chill and experienced
4901,Roger  Holguin,yes he often repeats himself and the class becomes repetitive and boring his lectures are poor he notify students when rude with no reason at all.if you want to learn business take classes somewhere else
4902,Roger  Holguin,i took him for business intro and earned an a now that im taking him for finance and marketing noticed that he often repeats himself and thus the class becomes repetitive and boring at times he has a sense of humor his lectures are fun but never there for office hours and he notify students when absent
4903,Roger  Holguin,nothing but praise for this professor very articulate tells interesting stories that relate to class materials straight forward he reviews before the midterm and final quizzes tests are extremely easy as long as you read pay attention grades on curve take his class you regret it learn lessons stick with you
4904,Roger  Holguin,i took the fast paced class for summer i sat front row seats because i love his lectures very clear he tells you what will be on the test professor grades on curve he loves questions is very experianced he gives tons of examples he take attendance daily but he does notice when someone there i got an a happy great teacher
4905,Roger  Holguin,great professor very clear about what talking about no need to ask questions everything that is wanted to know was answered
4906,Roger  Holguin,always late missed out of classes his lectures are useless do not take notes but he takes roll sometimes so attendance does count keep your papers that he hands back he loses them and you get no grade for it read the book and be fine pretty easy a
4907,Roger  Holguin,he knows his stuff but does not cover the textbook thoroughly he tests on some things not discussed in class count on the lecture you need to read the text he does give helpful info and good real life examples he requires weekly reports on an article from the wall street journal
4908,Roger  Holguin,very good teacher hard test though
4909,Roger  Holguin,very helpful teacher learn alot in class give great tips in everything you want to know from starting your own business to stocks enjoyable class
4910,Roger  Holguin,no comments
4911,Jessie  Yearwood,i would not take again she can be rude and snobby very opinionated and vocal about it she gets too dramatic in her lectures made me want to fall asleep her tests were so unorganized it was so frustrating knows a lot of information but lacks substance doesnt reply to emails when she does its vague takes long to grade assignments
4912,Jessie  Yearwood,she might seem intimating but only because she cares about her students she is very knowledgeable about the subject and answers any questions you ask her her lectures are long but always interesting pass the class as long as you do your reading take notes and do the projects
4913,Jessie  Yearwood,unclear and seems to enjoy conflict
4914,Jessie  Yearwood,ms yearwood overall a great teacher she can be confusing with dates for assignments and projects but overall she is very knowledgeable about the subject if you just read the chapters you will do fine
4915,Jessie  Yearwood,she is a really good teacher and you can tell she cares about the students you will have to work for your grade in her class she wants us to succeed but not just going to give you what you earn her lectures are long sometimes they make you want to sleep very informative though
4916,Jessie  Yearwood,there is no question she would not do anything to help her students but she does not know how to teach she spends most of the class going off on her soap box about stuff that has nothing to do with the course than she will not allow a break and makes you do all her test in the testing center on your time take her for chef
4917,Jessie  Yearwood,ms yearwood class can be intensive sometimes but she is a very good teacher makes sure you learn the material and expects you to remember it can be funny at times and mean at the same time she does a lot for her students and the school can be a great advisor
4918,Jessie  Yearwood,fun and full of excitement you must follow directions and listen carefully in the beginning it may be easy but near the end of the semester she will give you projects with very simple and sometimes incomplete instructions but she expects you to do them and to make it perfect she will also tell you due dates only once so pay attention
4919,Jessie  Yearwood,been reading some of the other comments made about ms yearwood and i get it she is very informative and obviously a very intelligent person just because she expects you to do your work because college make her a bad teacher
4920,Jessie  Yearwood,shes a good teacher she knows her stuff isnt easy if in the class to learn be ok if there because you have to be have some trouble.she gives a lot of assignments she really does care about the culinary students she can be in a rush everything she has to do at the school your not just another student her
4921,Jessie  Yearwood,class only offered online extremely poor communicator class requirements very clear tests extremely longtoo much material per testshould break down test to be more manageable do extra credit do online study until you receive on ea do study guides memorize i earned a but not without extreme effort not many earn a told
4922,Jessie  Yearwood,she makes no sense min lectures for a simple yes no answer takes class on a kitten tour on last day of class give me a break do that on day one seems overwhelmed and borders on mental illness student beware she is the worst
4923,Jessie  Yearwood,if you are at all serious about learning health and sanitation yearwood is the gal for you it sticks with you long after you have left her class and you use it at all times clean hands right temps for food handling and receiving your future employer will be impressed
4924,Jessie  Yearwood,this woman is terrible she return emails and not easy to talk to i dropped the class i spoken to anyone who likes her
4925,Jessie  Yearwood,like a rentacop on a power trip that takes delight in failing or hurting gpa her students takes wk to respond to emails answers not pertaining to the the most useless unrealistic worst instructor ever had
4926,Jessie  Yearwood,there are not words to explain that she is a wonderful skilled teacher she knows the material and she is willing to help you any time you have to remember she is clear and direct in her instruction her projects are straigh foward as long as you follow each step in her instructions
4927,Jessie  Yearwood,i took her telecourse class it was very hard because the information on the study guide did not match the information on the tests she is a hard grader when i tried to email her any questions she would only leave a vague answer
4928,Jessie  Yearwood,i took her telecourse one of the most difficult classes ever taken the lecture tests were not easy but that wasnt the hard part of it u had to figure things out on ur own making an a in her class is not easy the only class except for the nursing i didnt make an a in
4929,Jessie  Yearwood,knows her stuff maybe too well hard classes but only because she cares you will have to study want to learn take her classes
4930,Jessie  Yearwood,great teacher her specialty is nutrition and saftey and sanitation show up do your work and interact in class and you will do great she doesnt sugar coat anything so dont get your feelings hurt recommended
4931,Karen  Cardozo-Kane,does not stick with in her own grading rubrics changes assignments at the last minute does not follow her own syllabus talks about herself a lot in class for papers grades on a five point scale a four will drop you to an eighty a three to a sixty extra credit is not helpful to your final grade
4932,Karen  Cardozo-Kane,only college class i was sad to see end cardozo has a huge heart and loves connecting with her students and being able to believe in their abilities inspirational and centered if you have a chance to take a course taught by her and its a smaller classroom you will benefit greatly
4933,Karen  Cardozo-Kane,professor cardozo is super helpful and one of the best in studies to incorporate issues of politics and identity into her coursework super smart and really sweet definitely take a class from her
4934,Karen  Cardozo-Kane,interesting assignments

4941,Dan  Lair,awesome lots of blackboard work but really helpful and makes things interesting
4942,Dan  Lair,dan is hot but he is a loner and does have an egotistical side he does think that he knows it all and he is good communications but not good people in general
4943,Dan  Lair,no comments
4944,Dan  Lair,was able to explain and apply most everything very well but he also thought he knew everything very fair on grading papers and test
4945,Dan  Lair,egotistical
4946,Dan  Lair,no comments
4947,Dan  Lair,no comments
4948,Dan  Lair,very full of himself class was easy enough i guess but he really thought he was a lot smarter than he really is
4949,Dan  Lair,not a course for linear thinkers but the instructor was very good
4950,Beth  Fratkin,beth was a very good teacher she used the book a alot and there were major projects the whole semester she was a bit unorganized sometimes but very friendly and helpful if you had any questions she would do her best and very leniant at times overall if you go to class and do the work you will pass good teacher
4951,Beth  Fratkin,i took her mass comm law class was it hard yes a law class she makes the information so acessible and loves to engage the students in discussion it help when half of the kids in class pay attention then complain about their grades adults show up and study hard she did a great job and miss taking her class
4952,Beth  Fratkin,not prepared and uniformed
4953,Beth  Fratkin,overall i good teacher
4954,Beth  Fratkin,a character
4955,Beth  Fratkin,intro course excellent instructor very helpful and friendly
4956,Baron  Stewart,this teacher is very helpful if you have a chance to pick your professor he is great
4957,Erin  Finn,she is the most organized professor ever had and the class was fun looking forward to it at all but it was great no pushover but as long as you come to class and do the assigned work be fine
4958,Erin  Finn,erin is a great teacher so helpful and makes everyone feel very welcome she is extremely positive and understands that most people are not comfortable with speaking in front of a class i totally recommend taking her for com we all have to take so you may as well enjoy it she is great
4959,Erin  Finn,probably best college class i had so far fun and useful made alot of friends in this class
4960,Erin  Finn,i had such a good time in class last night i thought post this she does stuff and keeps us on track
4961,Erin  Finn,i had thought outlining was over rated but what i learned in this class just got me thru a presentation in my new job i was the best presenter in my training group i am braggin work in her class but now i feel it was worth it
4962,Erin  Finn,worst teacher ever closed minded even kept us late a couple of times take my advice advoid this teacher hardest entry level speaking class
4963,Erin  Finn,may have been knowledgeable teach a diffucult person to deal with on a weekly basis
4964,Erin  Finn,erin is a sweet girl the stupid outlines she makes us do is rediculous that is where she takes most of her grades from this class should not b as hard as it is at first it was fun we played some games her quizes r horrible shes not a quick responder via emails she does care alot about ur grade and will try to help you dont get ur hopes up
4965,Erin  Finn,i failed com then took prof evening class and it was great i thought she was an awesome teacher she was very specific and detailed in outlining the chapters very helpful and enthusiastic she gave great feedback after giving back speeches easy a or
4966,Erin  Finn,she a bad teacher but her lectures were confusing she seem the friendliest person i dropped her class let that be a hint for you all
4967,Erin  Finn,i should have done better in that class shes tough when she grades the outlines
4968,Erin  Finn,this teacher only teaches a few classes here she was ok not particularly difficult not a bad person but was close minded to different creative approaches to public speaking
4969,Jim  Uyekawa,jim is a really good professor hes clear and takes the extra time to help you he hates when people are late and or miss alot of class as long as you really make an effort hell teach you as much as you want to learn perspective drawing was tough and very precision heavy better if youve taken drawing beforehand
4970,Jim  Uyekawa,best art teacher hands down i learned so much from his classes and improved dramatically under his wing he definitely cares about his students and will go the extra mile for students
4971,Jim  Uyekawa,jim is by far the best art instructor had at elac his dedication and level of expertise are unparalleled learned so much from him without hesitation i enthusiastically recommend him to anyone
4972,Jim  Uyekawa,best art instructor had so far
4973,Jim  Uyekawa,best art professor that i have had i love how each of his assignment taught me something new
4974,Jim  Uyekawa,inspirational teacher he is there for you if you need help be afraid just ask expects you to try in class and on your assignments do not take his class for granted you will learn to pick out your own mistakes overtime
4975,Jim  Uyekawa,to be honest not very hard at grading if you do exactly everything he says the main reason why people get and not is because they try to take shortcuts do that here very strict but very easy to get along with outside of class
4976,Jim  Uyekawa,i took jim for multiple classes and in each of his classes learned a lot took him for life drawing twice intro to painting oil painting and drawing
4977,Jim  Uyekawa,he is a great teacher gives constructive criticism all the time he uses a lot of repetition which got pretty boring to me after half of the semester he grades you based on your final portfolio mostly and daily sketches we only used the book about two times he is strict and does not like ppl who are constantly late nude models are cool
4978,Jim  Uyekawa,very likely the hardest working and most dedicated instructor that i have seen in a while will push students to do their very best and works hard to make sure students have a good learning environment be warned he is tough and will not take any bs come on time come prepared and work hard for your grade
4979,Jim  Uyekawa,if u hv passion and wanna learn a lot of drawing jim will help u a lot he is good at not only teaching art but also helpful for letting u know what is right thing to do in your life show him your effort and u will do great
4980,Jim  Uyekawa,i like how this teacher grades some student i did better got better grades than i did for some reason
4981,Jim  Uyekawa,this professor is no good at all i felt like i wasted a lot of money on supplies not important for learning
4982,Jim  Uyekawa,this teacher is terrible tells stories half the time and although he is hard on you it help if he does not teach much
4983,Jim  Uyekawa,he was a really good teacher he helps me to be a better student
4984,Jim  Uyekawa,good at the subject and u do learn from his class however he sees attendance way more than efforts u put in he bother to know ur unforeseen difficulties just be there on time even ur body or situations not allow u to do so keep ur finger cross that ur body fail u or run into any kind of emergencies during the weeks
4985,Jim  Uyekawa,everyone is entitled to their opinion jim ever criticize any artwork but will give his opinion to improve on it meaning take it home and touch up on it for the final portfolio you be lazy in his class or you will get the grade you deserve he will give you his undivided attention as long as you need
4986,Jim  Uyekawa,not going to lie this class is pretty hard granted i got an a but i had already taken regular drawing classes before and worked really hard jim is a good professor pretty helpful when demonstrating homework assignments and critiques he lets you redo the work for a higher grade which i think is great manuel the t.a is awesome
4987,Jim  Uyekawa,jim is a great teacher ive had him for times as a teacher if you dont like to draw or your a slacker dont take his class youll be wasting his time as well as the other class mates if your competitive and want to improve on your drawing then this his class in my opinion anyone who has gave a bad remark is full of it
4988,Jim  Uyekawa,this guy is just like a sales i didnt learn so much in the class take his class unless you want to waste alot of money if you do please find ways to get the textbooks for cheaper
4989,John  Enomoto,easy class attendance mandatory you buy the book read it and do the online assignments if you want to actually learn take another class if you want an easy a take this class he also keep you for the full hours of the class
4990,John  Enomoto,he started the class days after the short semester started very unclear with instructions and respond to emails not involved with the class and the program is what will be teaching you and grading your work the program is extremely specific in how it wants you to answer questions which is extremely frustrating
4991,John  Enomoto,all i can say is if you want to learn in this class take someone else
4992,John  Enomoto,easiest class ever taken if you know how to do the bare minimum in microsoft office you can get an a bother showing up on time because he sure as hell he makes you print out your assignments so be prepared to spend money on the print service old and confuses himself a lot so be prepared to teach yourself
4993,John  Enomoto,you definitely need the book because of the online code only tests during the term easy homework and assignments if you have essential knowledge in microsoft office you have problems getting a good grade sometimes is not clear explaining in class but not a bad teacher pd if you ask him many questions he might get mad sometimes lol
4994,John  Enomoto,buy the book from the bookstore do not buy the online code without the book the book is a must easy class gives extra credit basics for excel word access and power point only gave exams throughout the semester lot of times forgets stuff class had to remind him overall an easy class i would recommend him nice teacher
4995,John  Enomoto,currently taking him his class is the easiest class ever taken not disrespecting him i like to think pretty tech savvy and i like technology but for someone who use word excel access and somewhat hardware i can see them having a tougher time easy a he is a fair grader gives a lot of time for work and tests
4996,John  Enomoto,i took this class on summer professor is so nice he always helpfulness but he cant give good grade and i dont think is easy about his test i just got grade b on this class that so sad you need buy his book cause have code with that book his all test online
4997,John  Enomoto,okay professor he teaches at the beginning of class and then you do your own work his tests are online so better buy the code or you would not pass the test is exact as the online work so just review and be okay the only con is that he can be boring but college
4998,John  Enomoto,this class was too easy i seriously could have done it in my sleep if you know the basics of power point word excel and access you will get an a just show up participate and turn in your assignments on time this class could be hard for anyone with very limited computer skills but for most it will be the easiest class of their academic path
4999,John  Enomoto,enomoto is the nicest teacher of all time he is very chill and does not yell he also explains thing very well
5000,John  Enomoto,work hard play hard he always says that veryful and making the class interesting
5001,John  Enomoto,easy class he is a bit unclear with his instructions at times though he answers on etudes i took it online and you have to come to campus for the exams final textbook with required homework assignments is very overpriced if you understand computer basics then this is an easy a class
5002,John  Enomoto,eaassyy but talks very fast gets kind of mad when you ask questions cause you are confused anyways would recommend if you need easy a
5003,John  Enomoto,great overview of computer technology course content and exercises were straight forward easy to understand prof enomoto is friendly and patient highly recommend his class as the lead into co sci am a little richer for the knowledge both reviewed and gained here
5004,John  Enomoto,this was my first class did all assignments did pretty good on the quizzes his a good professor reviews the work with you just in case you missed any assignments i really learned how to use the microsoft programs and the different stuff u can do i highly recommend him easy a
5005,John  Enomoto,this class is stress free if you want an easy a take mr enomoto you need a textbook the final is so easy and its a take home no mid term forgot the most important thing mr enomoto lets you leave early to do your homework in the lab if you have any because he lets you do his homework in class regardless you leave early
5006,John  Enomoto,this class is an automatic a if you do you work the right way which is really easy not to mention there are extra credit opportunities given so take advantage of them the test grades are based on a curve but really easy i highly recommend enomoto so take this class
5007,John  Enomoto,mr enomoto is a really nice instructor if you want to get an a you need to take this class he lets you leave early this way you have time to go to the lab to do your homework he also will give extra credit toward the end of the semister
5008,John  Enomoto,mr enomoto is a very nice instructor he is helpful and he is very easy what i liked about his class was that he would let you out early to go to the lab to do your homework if you want an a you need to take him
5009,Xiaoping  Teng,a wonderful professor i learned so much from her does have a lot of homework but to be expected given a language class
5010,Xiaoping  Teng,everything good that a professor is expected to be i provided much more detailed feedback on scrutiny go check it out and man do i love her authentic chinese accent
5011,Xiaoping  Teng,professor teng is lovely and gracious as a mount holyoke student i definitely found the trip worthwhile
5012,Xiaoping  Teng,love professor teng she is always well prepared and very helpful
5013,Xiaoping  Teng,nice but tough you have to study everyday to do well
5014,Xiaoping  Teng,terrible sense of humor but tries hard willing to go out of her way to improve the class in general overall ok althugh i prefer prof shen
5015,Xiaoping  Teng,helpful attentive and works hard at her lessons
5016,Xiaoping  Teng,no comments
5017,Xiaoping  Teng,no comments
5018,Alison  Hodges,my favorite professor so far calm cool easy going and informative alison
5019,Alison  Hodges,i recommend another baking instructor alison bakes like lynn mattie and teaches dining room service like beth sonnier
5020,Alison  Hodges,another good one knowledgable and helpful needs to increase her degree of difficulty a little too basic
5021,Alison  Hodges,alison is a great teacher i would recommend her for any class she is a real chef with real experience
5022,Alison  Hodges,good instructor for baking and dining room service classes clear knowledgeable knows the material always willing to help you out will work with each and every student
5023,Rick  Bradbury,good attitude very willing to help students gives constructive feedback
5024,Rick  Bradbury,his postive spirit helps students when the going gets tough he is very kind and willing to help
5025,Rick  Bradbury,no comments
5026,Rick  Bradbury,say anything negative about this guy he cares about helping students learn and it shows just look at all his teaching awards
5027,Bill  Hodges,there is definitely a lot to learn from him pay attention to all he does his techniques are great
5028,Bill  Hodges,instructor is horrible does not matter if you bust you butt or sit on it everyone gets the same grade does not require participation so most students walk and a few do all of the cleaning not a fair instructor too laid back
5029,Bill  Hodges,bill is easily one of my favorite teachers he makes the class fun and his teaching methods work great i would definitely recommend taking his class
5030,Bill  Hodges,avoid if at all possible class and instructor are a waste of time
5031,Bill  Hodges,great instructor you out early all the time
5032,Bill  Hodges,great chef and teacher just wished they would let him teach during the day
5033,Bill  Hodges,i really enjoy his class he is helpful and he teaches excatly what is going to be on the test awesome teacher recommended
5034,Bill  Hodges,what allison is to baking he is to cooking offers good advice been there done that listen to him
5035,Bill  Hodges,bill not only will teach you things that are required for the class but he will offer advice and suggestions to all that seek it
5036,Bill  Hodges,he is a great teacher he is very nice and helpful i highly recommend this teacher he is a real chef with real experience
5037,Bill  Hodges,like his wife bill is a very good kitchen and bakery instructor helpful friendly good at teaching recommended
5038,Chris  Miller,chef chris is wonderful and a must have here at el centro you wont be disappointment with his as an instructor he does get upset if you listen and follow instructions
5039,Chris  Miller,chris is a great teacher i will take her class again if i can register within the minutes it takes for her classes to fill up
5040,Chris  Miller,no comments
5041,Chris  Miller,very knowledgable instructor very imaginative nice easygoing person take this fun class
5042,Chris  Miller,what a sweetheart so talented i can not say enough good things about this teacher awesome
5043,Chris  Miller,best cake decorating instructor nice friendly easygoing always willing to help
5044,Larry  Goff,read your book and you will make an a.you must read and pay attention to the lectures
5045,Larry  Goff,tool online class very easy answers questions and concerns in timely manner very flexible took him for both classes and made east still remember what i learnt
5046,Larry  Goff,i took mr goff for summer online i loved the class very easy and he tells you clearly what you have to do to pass his class i made a b and i was throughly pleased with his class
5047,Larry  Goff,lectures are boring tests are hard because he talk about the material on them learned absolutely nothing from his class
5048,Larry  Goff,i like this professor
5049,Larry  Goff,if you like to read and memorize the textbook you can take him for you psychology class not an easy a teacher for me he only give the extra credit for doing a volunteer job nothing else for extra credit i have any attraction for psychology his lecture fun or interesting he use slide and tv not a fun teaching
5050,Larry  Goff,he thinks he is cerebral
5051,Larry  Goff,hes really funny when he gets going its just those stupid take home tests and in class tests that he gives us that suck i mean he goes on and on about stuff that isnt even on the test
5052,Larry  Goff,this guy was just plain boring a little sensitive too
5053,Larry  Goff,he is nice and makes the cleass interesting
5054,Larry  Goff,he makes this class interesting
5055,Larry  Goff,no comments
5056,Larry  Goff,has no respect for the people who are trying to earn a living and ask for his help to get through his class
5057,Larry  Goff,his lectures are long sometimes they can be interesting but other times he just talks and talks
5058,Paul  Velleman,no longer teaching professror emeritus laid a good foundation for future teachers to model his clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses master teacher
5059,Paul  Velleman,dr velleman and though i took his class nearly years ago provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general it helps develop a sense of how it should be done listen to this brilliant man it will do you good the class i took years ago had a different code so this is my best guess what it is now
5060,Paul  Velleman,sounds like someone who did not pass the course last spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him he did not even teach the fall
5061,Paul  Velleman,the lectures were actually pointless for this class make sure you read the textbook i learned all the stats i know from the textbook not him
5062,Paul  Velleman,we use datadesk a program he invented years ago instead of something more modern his ego is so big we use a real stat program since it was made by someone else makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program
5063,Paul  Velleman,he loves the sound of his own voice take another professor if you really wanna learn stats
5064,Paul  Velleman,promises to be your statistician for life but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself take another professor for this required class if you can
5065,Paul  Velleman,never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he even taught yet
5066,Paul  Velleman,i was amazed that someone could have such a large ego he acts like too good for an intro to stats course but i think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays that goes right to his pocket
5067,Paul  Velleman,very clear lecturer excited about statistics does have an ego but you interact with him much anyway if you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters do well on the exams put in the work and learn stats i understand the subject so much better now take this class you regret it
5068,Paul  Velleman,fine at best he is disgustingly arrogant however if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it which is good some days he can be very boring tests are fair and papers yes papers quite a few of them are not terrible at all overall not terrible but not enjoyable
5069,Paul  Velleman,the class is super easy go to lecture and do the homework and be set he bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year
5070,Paul  Velleman,i took intro stats and although velleman is known for taking the math out of stats the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences and super approachable if you study do well when he says taking the math out he just means you have to do rote calculations you think and logic it
5071,Paul  Velleman,takes all the math out of statistics which has its positives and negatives weekly homework and various different assignments required tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking class can be painfully boring at times best part of the class is the textbook which professor velleman wrote himself easy textbook to read
5072,Paul  Velleman,great textbook written by him
5073,Paul  Velleman,velleman is an excellent teacher i actually enjoyed reading the textbook which he wrote due to its conversational style and interesting examples he posts all his lectures online so attendance is not mandatory if you choose not to go you should still watch the lecture videos they help with the homework
5074,Paul  Velleman,i loved this class velleman is excellent professor perhaps the best had so far at cornell i had no experience with statistics before his class but his lectures and textbook were so clear you can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and great at explaining them i strongly recommend him
5075,Paul  Velleman,great guy conveyed a lot of passion about the subject and gave a great intro to statistics he really understands what he is teaching and to whom and the class is well structured even though there was some confusion about the he was also very democratic as to grading exams removing confusing questions postexam
5076,Paul  Velleman,good professor
5077,Paul  Velleman,easily one of the best ilr professors out there the way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations and instead requires you to critically think and understand data exceptionally smart but very approachable tests are fair but can be tricky grades are curved at the end
5078,Lawrence  Kahn,not the best teacher around but a nice guy amazing knowledge of subject matter do all the readings and go to class and you should do well willing to help in office class test questions can be either overly vague or demand an unreasonable amount of detail okay overall class
5079,Lawrence  Kahn,i know why getting such a bad rap sure not the best teacher around but a nice guy and will amaze you with his sports knowledge just do all the readings which are mostly interesting and write everything you know on the essay tests and be fine the baseball salary arbitration paper is really fun not a hard class
5080,Lawrence  Kahn,this professor is the worst ever someone forgot to remind him that he has a duty as a teacher as well as a researcher thanks larry
5081,Lawrence  Kahn,kahn seems to know a lot about labor econ but i could not get past the constant licking of the fingers in a minute lecture the guy stuck his hands in his mouth over times i counted heard varying accounts approaching the class had professors and i think i learned the least from kahn just not a great teacher but very knowledgable
5082,Lawrence  Kahn,he is a tad boring but he can explain the material well
5083,Lawrence  Kahn,awful
5084,Lawrence  Kahn,i was really interested in sports bargaining but this class was not the appropriate forum for it kahn takes too much time trying to cover things that are repetitive boring and not necessary for the exams the presentations are fun to work on but you also need a good group to do it with
5085,Lawrence  Kahn,not very clear in his explanations lectures tend to be pretty boring funny jokes sometimes
5086,Lawrence  Kahn,no comments
5087,Lawrence  Kahn,no comments
5088,Lawrence  Kahn,the lectures are really unorganized he just rambles about whatever he feels like that day
5089,Lawrence  Kahn,the class had professors section was the worst having professors hurts grades and understanding of the material
5090,Gene  Pouncy,mr pouncy believes no student deserves an a this is his teaching philosophy his stories are interesting his teaching is good but not good enough to produce students capable of a quality work if you need an a to get into the nursing program or just for the sake of learning how to do high quality work pick another teacher
5091,Gene  Pouncy,i took this professor for both eng and and i enjoyed the class he made the early class interesting because most like myself were worked nights i believe he is a hard talent to follow in his field the professor is there to help you write scholarly papers job is not to hold your hand through the process
5092,Gene  Pouncy,mr p was very helpful to me this was my first year at college and taking eng so some things were a little bit dificult for me but with the help of mr pouncy i was able to pass the class and i thank him for all that he has helped me with
5093,Gene  Pouncy,i took his class and got a b i deserved an a it bothered me that once i worked at el centro i would hear him tell the faculty he never gives out because no one deserves one the only reason still teaching is good pals with the president a shame fools like him are allowed to even be employed at a college
5094,Gene  Pouncy,an smarter person but a very bad teacher there were only essays and final fist one i got a c with some many marks the sec one i gave my best to get a a and i got another c with almost any mark correction of the class got c only b nobody got a i decided to drop the class
5095,Gene  Pouncy,this professor is not interested in giving you a true education he is interested in the extent to which he can persuade other people to reinforce his very aggressive and prejudiced political agenda do not take class if you are white female or shy you can only achieve an a grade if you agree with his views
5096,Gene  Pouncy,one thing about mr pouncy he talks about his gun alot he has alot of stories but generally not a bad teacher even though it was back in fall it bad
5097,Gene  Pouncy,took pouncey in wish this was around then i felt terrible after attending his class and feel much better after hearing everyone elses comments
5098,Gene  Pouncy,any teacher who continually preaches about racial issues and cannot move on is not worth listening to mr pouncy is still harping on the atrocities of the past rather than finding resolutions for the future i sat in this joke of a class for days take it i am an a student when it comes to writing but this worth it
5099,Gene  Pouncy,now to finish my review from below i sat in the back of the class room all semester and hardly ever spoke i think it took him most of the semester to remember my name i completed all of my essays and made a b in the class yes his stories did get old especially when he repeated them but he is one of the best professors that i have had a
5100,Gene  Pouncy,i think that everyone of you that has written a bad review about mr pouncy should reflect on why you received the grade that you did if it is hard for you to figure out what he wants from you then you need to take his advice and visit him during his office hours just like he tells you if writting is hard for you then take someone else
5101,Gene  Pouncy,fun class with great discussions put in the work and be fine after all this is college essay topics were weak though made an a
5102,Gene  Pouncy,his class is super hard what you call if you want an a your a will turn out to be a c or if he really really does like you a b a good person from the inside but not a great teacher
5103,Gene  Pouncy,i had to drop mr class after hearing about african american history for four classes in a row not so sure cut out to be a teacher or if enjoys the teaching aspect or the grading aspect better
5104,Gene  Pouncy,he expects you to be at his level of knowledge regarding literature and the world in general he would be off teaching at major university with his phd this is a community college not harvard
5105,Gene  Pouncy,great professor gets class thinking
5106,Gene  Pouncy,mr pouncy is a great english teacher but you will not get an easy grade in his class you have to work hard and he does challenge his students only because he wants to prepare them for university level pouncy always informed us that we are the only one that can truly increase our knowlegde and become effective at being a good student i am am
5107,Gene  Pouncy,sometimes smart people are hard to approach he knows what hes talking about just is very unique in his delivery
5108,Gene  Pouncy,he is a very intelligent man his teaching however lacks he talks all class about random subjects that are interesting the final was a killer hard grader
5109,Gene  Pouncy,believe me take class.you are not gonna get any thing from either grade or good knowledge.so why you spent your money and valuable time for nothing
5110,Jerry  Jones,if you want an a take this class he is extremely knowledgeable in his field but not real computer saavy copy the questionsanswers to all powerpoints down as you will need those for the online tests for each chapter classmates are loud and rude to him and take advantage of his kind nature no finaljust show up to get your final grade
5111,Jerry  Jones,he is really easy if u want to really understand and know things from his class i advice you to take another person he is an easy a all you have to do is come take attendance and leave if u he just makes you work on the test questions witch are on line if u need a humanities class take him he is easy
5112,Jerry  Jones,jerry is a very thoughtful person and truly understanding i have completed my music composition classes through him and he has helped me immensely often he will leave the classroom and not return for some time i have had to deal with loud and obnoxious rude classmates because of this but overall i would recommend any of his classes
5113,Jerry  Jones,took online class very easy some of the answers are wrong on the tests and after showing him where it said otherwise in the book he quickly changed the grade he will reopen tests if you want a better grade never met but i would recommend
5114,Jerry  Jones,very easy class if taken in the classroom the online class has to do much more work than the oncampus class and from what seen mr jones is not very computer savvy so if you want an easy a for humanities take his class but not online tests are open book and if you are genuinely interested in humanities mr jones has a lot to say
5115,Jerry  Jones,if you take his class online you must understand that he will take forever to email you back you have to get the book for the assignments.the work is easy and you have to read the book just skim for the answer or if you can look them up he really instruct us well i recommend
5116,Jerry  Jones,if you take this teacher online he is useless know how to work ecampus will receive incorrect grades and when you email him about it good luck getting a response
5117,Jerry  Jones,jerry jones is a useless teacher his students have no idea what they are missing as far as higher music theory education goes i feel sorry for students who take their first two years of college theory from him because they are going to be in for a rough ride when they transfer mr j is nice but definitely not suited to teach college
5118,Jerry  Jones,he is extremely helpful he was more than willing to do all he could to ensure that i understood the content professor jones is a wonderful teacher
5119,Jerry  Jones,mr jones is awesome he is all of the music hero he is helpful and real laid back anyone could get along with him he is the koolest
5120,Jerry  Jones,the class is very easy he gives you the answers to the tests on a study guide
5121,Jerry  Jones,class is structured to get an a however some folks are lazy and expect to earn an a from your effort the tests are taken at the students convience in testing center most classmates will wait until you take the test and try to borrow your graded scantron and cheat off your efforts part of grade is attendance
5122,Jerry  Jones,that is a easy class
5123,Jerry  Jones,quite enjoyable just wish use a little more explanatory textbooks
5124,Jerry  Jones,thoroughly enjoyed him as a teacher and as a person very helpful
5125,Jerry  Jones,i think mr jones is a great teacher and he was very willing to work around my schedule and help me whenever i had questions
5126,Jerry  Jones,class work is individualized goes out of his way to help students that ask
5127,Jerry  Jones,no comments
5128,John  Corvino,professor corvino is fantastic he is funny and caring this class consisted of a lot of reading and only exams so come to every class and study hard for the exams
5129,John  Corvino,corvino was an excellent lecturer he kept the class engaged and interesting definitely read the course pack and participate in class discussion portion seemed a bit pointless to me sometimes however the lecture itself was wonderful exam questions were confusing and tricky at time but the workload is not much
5130,John  Corvino,invokes discussion and provides useful feedback my only issue is the amount of reading and the exams require you to remember specific points from all readings do the grading so be sure to ask them what they look for not the easiest course but lectures are sure to get you thinking about things from a new perspective smart guy
5131,John  Corvino,great professor makes things easy to understand follow along during lecture and be fine
5132,John  Corvino,professional ethics was maybe the most interesting and engaging class i have taken at wayne corvino wanted us to be involved in the discussion and found a way to make a potentially boring subject really interesting if you came to class and read the material then you were pretty much set up for an a i definitely recommend a class with him
5133,John  Corvino,one of my favorite courses at wsu corvino is very engaging has a light personality which gets you interested in the material make sure to keep up on all the readings and come to every class as his insight into the readings gives much clarity very helpful when needed exams are not difficult if you follow the readings and notes he gives
5134,John  Corvino,dr corvino is very smart individual and a good professor his course was fair there are a lot of readings so make sure to keep up with them and actually understand them four exams all with the same weight make up the grade so prepare well in advance for them
5135,John  Corvino,good teacher class too hard only problem i had was my final grade was an and i still got a oh well
5136,John  Corvino,some of this stuff can be confusing or not interesting for most people there are a lot of readings so be prepared the number one mistake is not showing up to class his lectures and class discussions give a lot more clarity to the content not bad but kind of a demanding prof
5137,John  Corvino,extremely difficult professor for a general education course requirement gives way too many readings and does not understand that we have other classes and majors his exams are too tricky do not take him if you want an a
5138,John  Corvino,i had john corvino for contemporary moral issues and it was by far my favorite class taken at wayne he is hilarious and makes discussions fun he is open to opinion and does not force his on you overall an excellent professor strongly recommended
5139,John  Corvino,there is no excuses for not doing well his tests were straight off the notes and their wasnt even that many notes to learn in the first place anyone who said it was hard or that he was bad simply did not try
5140,John  Corvino,the kind of professor every college student should experience at least once in their academic life entertaining so the class never gets boring and if you have a problem and talk to him very understanding just make sure to keep up with the reading and try to say at least one thing in class he likes class participation
5141,John  Corvino,prof corvino is awesome make sure you come to class and read the material and you will do just fine his were awesome too very helpful and clear
5142,John  Corvino,amazing professor smart as well as handsome you will be glued to your seat during his lecture.and go to office hours he will help you out i lovv him you have to study your material and show him you know stuff clss is noy impossible as long as u know your stuff
5143,John  Corvino,he is a awesome teacher im taking more philosophy classes just because of his teaching and because he is so hot
5144,John  Corvino,fantastic actually
5145,John  Corvino,very good professor one of the best you must come to class pay attention and do the readings my only problem was learning phi lingo but that was on me not fault good class
5146,John  Corvino,very hard class the material is very mundane and boring i did not do well in this class and i attended lecture when i could had credits read the material and felt i did well on his tests but did horrible ta was boring but enthusiastic corvino is very smart and loves his job but takes phi too seriously my worst grade in college thus far
5147,John  Corvino,this guy knows his stuff for sure but this class is very hard you have to be on top of all the reading and pay attention to every word he says in order to do well on exams the exams are tough and composed of tricky multiple choice and essays he can spot if you unsure in your essays and you will be marked down
5148,Rebecca  Laidlaw,great professor cute personality really interactive with the class not an easy grader when it comes to speeches but if you do the work then get a good grade
5149,Rebecca  Laidlaw,in my experience taking this class i noticed that laidlaw wanted every one in the class to succeed and helped us every step of the way relatively easy and interesting class
5150,Rebecca  Laidlaw,ms laidlaw was an amazing professor very energetic and sarcastic but the class was def worth taking she made the class fun if you dont understand you need to ask for help and she will give you a more in depth answer some of the speehes were a little cheesy but in the long run they help with being able to speak in public
5151,Rebecca  Laidlaw,she is very unprofessional and admits that she is biased i have always aced speeches i competed across the state on the speech team in high school and won multiple speech contests and scholarships and got a b in her class you do the math if you have to take her focus more on winning her over than your speeches and do well
5152,Rebecca  Laidlaw,an okay teacher like when you disagree with her follow her outline and rules for speechmaking exactly the final speech is really lame interested at all during the class she is super hot though
5153,Rebecca  Laidlaw,laidlaw was an awesome teacher she is very enthusiastic with teaching and brings energy to class every day she grades fair and easy i would take her again if i had the opportunity
5154,Rebecca  Laidlaw,i loved this teacher she made the classroom enviornment so comfortable i have never looked forward to a class before i took this one and i hate public speaking the final is what lowered my grade to a b but she gives you a heads up on going to be on it so make sure you study i think she graded the speeches completely fair
5155,Rebecca  Laidlaw,i know what you all are talking about rebecca was awesome i never wanted to take this class but she was so fun and easy going i never wanted to miss a class she is so down to earth and laid back i love her
5156,Rebecca  Laidlaw,mrs laidlaw was an extremely resourceful teacher considering she teaches a subject more people would rather die than have to perform take her once a week class she tends to cancel some of them the final speech was optional also a really fun and interesting person and makes speech worth your while and money fair grader and gives good criticism
5157,Rebecca  Laidlaw,rebecca laidlaw is awesome she as tough as these comments say she is she makes everyone feel comfortable with speaking easily in fornt of the class by having everyone get to know one another the class was acually fun
5158,Rebecca  Laidlaw,learn much this teacher is not helpful and biased do not take this teacher if you have a major that requires public speaking
5159,Rebecca  Laidlaw,she is a very energetic teahcer very enthusiastic about her students knows her material definite reccomendation
5160,Rebecca  Laidlaw,loved her tough but fun gotta work for grade duh
5161,Rebecca  Laidlaw,i love her energy but is a very tough grader if you struggle take another teacher pretty sure the highest grade in the class was a b and those were very rare you have to work hard for a c
5162,Rebecca  Laidlaw,it is very frostrating when trying your best put a lot of affort which normally will help you to succeed but as a result you get a low grade and the interest to give another speech is gone if you have a chance to take another class do so
5163,Rebecca  Laidlaw,young and spunky a little chatty and a tough grader class is fun because so charismatic she has lots of activities that make you comfortable speaking in front of the class so the big speeches so intimidating
5164,Rebecca  Laidlaw,considering terrible at public speaking she was great at making me feel comfortable and giving me ideas on how to improve more more better knowledge of public speaking
5165,Rebecca  Laidlaw,very cool teacher
5166,Rebecca  Laidlaw,i think rebecca is an awesome teacher yes she does grade harder than others but thats made me try harder to get a better grade which isnt a bad thing she makes learning fun shes very sweet and i love her energy i would definitely recommend taking her especially if your looking to have fun and learn at the same time good challenge
5167,Rebecca  Laidlaw,very buddybuddy with students not professional so the environment is very comfortable but at the same time a tough grader she loves to talk about her personal life a lot she does convey important aspects of public speaking though
5168,Eugene A.  Berg,great i took his class over the summer at moorpark college and kept up with him just fine he gives reallife applications of the material throughout his lectures exams has a traditional teaching style provides book problems for help i did better only going off his notes write your notes neat enough to follow along when you rewrite them
5169,Eugene A.  Berg,i got a c in his class and i studied my butt off no office puts them mins before class but late to class sometimes so basically like he doesnt even have them his exams are not unfair and he is not a good partial grader if you miss step and it screws up the whole problem he takes off a lot of points
5170,Eugene A.  Berg,yeah as we all know chem is really hard i have gotten in my o chem classes but dr berg is just purely an incompetent professor if anybody who knew how to read english and write english with the help of periodic table thats him doesnt know a thing about teaching his exams are from the voo doo land.save urself and run from him
5171,Eugene A.  Berg,time for an honest review i got a b in goes way too fast when explaining the lectures how r you supposed to get ahead when you have no idea where in the book he is teaching from he covers random sections in the book and uses different methods to teach material i absolutely do not recommend this office hours avoid at all costs
5172,Eugene A.  Berg,chemistry with any professor is hard the subject is hard in general dr berg has years of experience and he really makes his lectures in a way where its understandable and applicable to exams his exams are difficult but not tricky pay attention and take notes make sure you make common student errors that he points out and practice
5173,Eugene A.  Berg,i would rather take a teacher that actually uses the textbook believe it or not the material he lectures does not even come from the book very easy to get lost
5174,Eugene A.  Berg,excellent
5175,Eugene A.  Berg,good good good just study hardd
5176,Eugene A.  Berg,just finished his class to end spring first glaring issue about him was he held no office hrs at all this class is hard enough and office hrs it was tough but he reguarly checked his email when i had questions he tried his best to answer them his tests were on the hard side you really have to study your butt off in his class gl
5177,Eugene A.  Berg,great teacher he is very helpful lecture material is clear and understandable tests are mainly based on notes tests are not easy but if you study the notes really well and attend class then youll do fine plus he curves the class
5178,Eugene A.  Berg,best damn chem teacher on campus very clear makes topics easy funny worth changing your schedule around for
5179,Eugene A.  Berg,very clear and understandable one of the best teachers i have had so far
5180,Eugene A.  Berg,you will love his sence of hummor this is the best teacher i have had at csun he will keep you interested in the material and motivated to come to class
5181,Eugene A.  Berg,great teacher as long as u go to class and pay attention you should do fine he has about quizzes exams and a final usually no hw
5182,Eugene A.  Berg,i love dr berg he always includes the students and ask if we need more help go to class take very good notes and theres the test straight from lecture but the lectures are not boring no need to buy the book great and helped me pass he also teaches at moorpark for chem take him
5183,Eugene A.  Berg,highly adored very friendly and willing to help he makes you feel comfortable learning the subject matter not an easy class my b is wellcherished
5184,Eugene A.  Berg,one of the very best teachers that i have ever had in any subject he is an unusually highly skilled instructor who is clear and articulate he makes the subject as fun and pragmatic as possible his tests are hard but very fair
5185,Eugene A.  Berg,love dr berg best chem teacher ever learned and laughed tests are challenging but science a true gem in the teaching profession
5186,Eugene A.  Berg,porof.berg is a great guy he makes the course interesting and fun also he is clear with the material and makes it easy to understand however his test are a bit on the hard side you must know the material inside out
5187,Eugene A.  Berg,great professor makes class easy and fun
5188,Daniel  Knudsen,good guy and some funny jokes during his lectures took him for g208 and it was an easy a
5189,Daniel  Knudsen,be prepared for lots of readings and bad jokes brilliant guy just has terrible lecturing skills and tends to devote whole class periods to unrelated or unhelpful material
5190,Daniel  Knudsen,professor knudsen is one of the most experienced and brilliant faculty in the iu geography department perhaps in the entire university his research spans many many subfields of the discipline he teaches courses on food geography and theory however the courses i took with him involved industrial and economic geography he is versatile
5191,Daniel  Knudsen,a good guy but has terrible teaching methods most of the learning is done through wikipedia and in class presentations done by the students the class had potential but his method of having students teach students is terrible lots of work for little reward
5192,Daniel  Knudsen,very easy class gotta go to lecture to get the lecture notes tho are multiple choice with only option the discussion counts for of your grade and the discussion labs are supper easy plus this class is real interesting definitely recommend taking this calss
5193,Daniel  Knudsen,ok class he often made jokes no one would get but he was a nice guy
5194,Daniel  Knudsen,my best prof ever take his class if you can
5195,Daniel  Knudsen,class was pretty cool a nice guy and pretty funny too
5196,Daniel  Knudsen,and still helping me
5197,Daniel  Knudsen,he was an easy teacher he made jokes in class and the tests were fairly simple you can easly skip class and still get an a
5198,Daniel  Knudsen,no comments
5199,Daniel  Knudsen,no comments
5200,Daniel  Knudsen,he made promises he did not keep during the first week of class by the time we got wise to him it was to late to drop the class
5201,Daniel  Knudsen,i hated this guy
5202,Daniel  Knudsen,no comments
5203,R.  Talavera,this teacher agravates me a lot he said that students who are not good in math are mental retards always remember him as a cruel teacher
5204,R.  Talavera,no comments
5205,R.  Talavera,his tests r hard but they r well worth it he helped create many good math teachers and engineers a few of them r teaching now in laney college of course with an easier approach to students
5206,R.  Talavera,he is so hard you better be well prepared and be very knowledgable of calculus i because he starts right into calc ii and look back confusing and has bad handwriting
5207,Fred  Ream,i had not taken algebra for over a decade when i signed up to take college algebra with mr ream he truly wants students to succeed and as long as you do the assigned homework and reach out to him if you are struggling he is more than happy to do whatever he can to help he tries to make math fun and gives curves on the exams highly recommend
5208,Fred  Ream,i am very fond of mr ream never done well with maths but i did very well in his class he is patient and makes sure you understand the concept he allows you to make up for partial credit he is old school but that is partly why i enjoyed his class so mucheasier undrstd he is friendly and very sharp i would take him again
5209,Fred  Ream,professor ream was a sweet old man and tries really hard to teach well but a struggle his lectures are wildly confusing and he goes off on tangents and abandons problems without actually showing us the answer he gives a ton of extra credit and curves everything so this class awful if math is a tough subject for you stay away
5210,Fred  Ream,mr ream goes out of his way to help you understand the material and he provides great feedback he has a great sense of humor and is never afraid to admit when wrong he loves statistics and used real life examples which made learning much easier i really enjoyed the semester spring and would most certainly take another of his classes
5211,Fred  Ream,fred is nice as a person but a terrible teacher his lectures are confusing and top of that he will give you his own notes looks like he used a typewriter and expects you to understand them he is old school and very forgetful i know anyone who is having it easy in this class very stressful and you need to make extra time for this class
5212,Fred  Ream,he truly is a nice old man and will help you but is very old fashioned he gives out packets for you to learn the material basically on your own but you do corrections which is nice his lectures are basically just examples and can be disorganized he wants you to write steps out but he skips steps himself which causes confusion
5213,Fred  Ream,i have to strain myself to understand what he is trying to say he speaks so softly and goes offtopic so often that you lose track of where you are in the book he skips sections entirely and gives out multipage handouts expecting you to understand it lets you do corrections for half credit for the first two quizzes and tests and homework
5214,Fred  Ream,mr ream wants all of his students to succeed and pass his class very helpful and eager to make sure that students understand his extra credit really helps out if struggling old school and might seem like a mess with all his papers flying around but on top of it highly recommend him for your math class
5215,Fred  Ream,fred is old school he has corny jokes and uses a popup projector but he is an extremely nice teacher i will admit his lectures are dry but he is willing to explain and help students just ask for help he lets you make up half points on quizzes and tests if show up to class you will pass
5216,Fred  Ream,fred is one of the best math teachers i have taken he is always willing to help i passed this class because of him however make sure you show up to class and miss a test
5217,Fred  Ream,really hard subject but lets you correct quizzes
5218,Fred  Ream,prof ream is one of the nicest professors out there a little awkward but super patient and willing to help students however his lectures are disorganized and undefined math come easily for me so although a hard worker and i took lots of notes i did have to spend a lot of time in the tutoring center to get a better grasp
5219,Fred  Ream,i dropped this class dr ream is super nice and kinda a cute old man he tries to make jokes but laugh at them so it just becomes awkward anyway he is very hard to follow im bad at math as it is but i just could not go on in this class his lectures are all over the place some classmates seemed to follow but i just did not
5220,Fred  Ream,second chance teacher allows for points to be made up
5221,Fred  Ream,so he is the most confusing person ever heard speak however he can be so helpful if you just ask for help i really encourage going to office hours they help a lot and he really is a really great guy you have to learn when to stop paying attention when it stops making sense
5222,Fred  Ream,if you have dr ream run for it a nice guy but a very confusing professor his lectures are random and scrambled he organized his tests are pretty hard vs the study guide he gives out and even get me started on the online homework completely awful i would not recommend
5223,Fred  Ream,excellent teacher very patient allows corrections on most tests and assignments for credit he also allows a fair amount of notes to use during quizzes and tests if you go to class and write notes on everything he writes on the board you will succeed he is always willing to take time and help i got an a in his class
5224,Fred  Ream,very patient and willing to help his students so much his quizzes and and tests are not too hard tests are based on the quizzes highly recommended
5225,Fred  Ream,fred will explain and reexplain it he is patient and will help you outside of class great visual aids in the classroom
5226,Fred  Ream,great instructor recommended
5227,Ewa  Duma,will tell you exactly how to do well in her class and will never set any traps the lectures are clear and she gladly answers your questions she may look stern to some people but she is actually pretty approachable and has great sense of humor go to class if you need to do the homework and her practice exams and you will do well
5228,Ewa  Duma,explanations are not her thing but over all easy class if you do the assignements properly easy a because her final is basicly questions from the book
5229,Ewa  Duma,dr duma is one of the best lecturers in math she explains in a way that makes it very clear what we need to know and what we her examples in class reflect directly what is going to be on the and finals she grades very fairly and is very kind i would take her again
5230,Ewa  Duma,not the worst teacher but certainly not the best she is lazy in class and skips a lot steps which can lead to confusion might be a language barrier thing but she almost seems condescending when answering inclass questions her teaching style is to show you the process rather than the theory which is not always ideal not a teacher for everyone
5231,Ewa  Duma,duma will be a good fit for you if good at selfteaching her are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance would recommend
5232,Ewa  Duma,she s a good teacher that makes sure her students understand very well her explications are clear highly recommend to do previous midterms and finals which is really helpful
5233,Ewa  Duma,really good teacher always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so unlike several other teachers she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial would take another class with her if i can thank you ewa duma
5234,Ewa  Duma,excellent teacher explains concisely and with much clarity but you need to pay attention in the class to do well the book pdf can be found online if you search for it
5235,Ewa  Duma,nice teacher explains well if you want to do good in math208 do past midterms and finals sometimes similar questions come up and sometimes the exact question comes up with the same numbers so whoever you have as a teacher just do past exams and understand the material
5236,Ewa  Duma,good professor there to help clear and fair
5237,Ewa  Duma,you need to learn to grow up and study on your own ignore the teacher you need to put so much effort in this course you need to do it on your own you need to do so many questions reading from the textbook is not enough she is absolutely useless in class unless u ask her to solve a specific problem in her office is when shed be useful
5238,Ewa  Duma,very good prof explains the material very well
5239,Ewa  Duma,she explains every thing really well and is extremely sweet with her students makes sure they understand everything before moving on to another subject the class is interesting but she makes it even more fun that is if you like math she is truly an amazing teacher she made my first semester much easier
5240,Ewa  Duma,amazing teacher i loved her go to your classes spend some time reading over her past finals and an guaranteed
5241,Ewa  Duma,best professor ever she is willing to help if you follow her instructions you can do great i love her
5242,Ewa  Duma,the best teacher ever her explanations are great and very clear she is very nice and knows that you need plenty of examples to understand the material all she does are examples in class which is the only way in my opinion that math should be taught go over her past practice exams very very similar
5243,Ewa  Duma,easy marker the beginning material is pretty simple so not much to discuss there she does a pretty good job when the topics get a bit more complex but since the course proofbased there is quite a bit of handwaving when it comes to theoretical rigour a necessary evil
5244,Ewa  Duma,probably the nicest lady you will ever meet not to mention one of the funniest her lectures are simple and she goes pretty quickly but stops if anyone has questions or if she notices people are confused and sometimes stays after class to offer extra help the midterm and finally are easy and if you understand the assignments be fine
5245,Ewa  Duma,decent professor in class but the best outside if you need help never had a prof try so hard to make sure her students understood the material genuinely a really really nice person and truly passionate about teaching
5246,Ewa  Duma,very nice lady and she means well but for explanations clear understanding what she was teaching was difficult do tons of practice patrickjmt tutorials on go to tutoring in the math center just take her in the summer midterm final were very similar to practice tests available
5247,Olga  Piedrahita,amazing teacher and extremely helpful some say she is tough but thats not true just attend class and dont be an idiot and youll do fine best teacher ever
5248,Olga  Piedrahita,the best teacher this department has learned so much a valuabe resource of information both in and outside of class she may be tough but learn alot again the best teacher in the department
5249,Olga  Piedrahita,possibly the scariest lb person on the planet but an excellent teacher she knows everything about everything and is very fond of her overhead projector just attend the classes make notes study and worry that she seem to like you nothing personal she like anyone survive
5250,Olga  Piedrahita,no comments
5251,Olga  Piedrahita,olga is there whenever to help you her over head notes a great and always the extra clarity thats needed is found within
5252,Olga  Piedrahita,olga was a wicked awesome teacher i was blessed to be taught by her she is just so intelligent
5253,Wayne  Grossman,okay i regret not knowing that his tests are directly from his slides even read the book i did that for the two tests and failed miserably term project did great on aced the final explained why i did bad on tests and he bump me up so i write for those after me study the gamimena slides u will get an a
5254,Wayne  Grossman,i learned absolutely nothing in this class that i figure out on my own with common sense the class was a waste of time but it made for an easy a and grossman although not helpful at all is really nice get on his good side and let you get away with anything his project is extreamly easy and his tests are a breeze
5255,Wayne  Grossman,his powerpoints summarize in the book problem is his voice is very low and i get bored easily cool cause you can just surf the web but you have to read the book to keep up rely on his lectures they go all over simulations and a case project mandatory for this class and section any way midterm and final
5256,Wayne  Grossman,very easy class project was a joke u need to buy the textbook test is straight from the powerpoint slide
5257,Wayne  Grossman,terribly boring just reads straight from papers even when telling students not to do so seems like an academic with no real knowledge never had such an ignorant business professor can speak condescendingly seems like a moron but thats just me
5258,Wayne  Grossman,best class to take in the summer he lets out class after a half hour or an hour its pretty interesting test straight from power point notes dont read the book just memorize all the slides group project which is fairly easy really nice guy really good summer class
5259,Wayne  Grossman,prof make class seem hard then it is to scare u if u study the slides the nite before and spoke out during discussion do fine tests and a group project which my group did the day before lecture is slow and dry but i got good news no not geico u have a computer so surf the web all u want but just check back in every once in a while
5260,Wayne  Grossman,this class is a joke.he takes attendance every class but it does not count towards your grade you can use the computers all class just study the powerpoint slides before the test you will be fine one group project that isnt hard at all i put minimal work into the class and got a b definately take this class
5261,Wayne  Grossman,teacher is soo odd weirdest teacher ive ever had makes funny faces and reacts oddly to fire drills kinda freaky actually i would avoid
5262,Wayne  Grossman,very nice guy tests are easy minimal studying
5263,Wayne  Grossman,just memorize the powerpoint slides n briefly go over the book pages he assigns before the exams n this class is a sleepwalk.u can use his class time as a study session.u can use pc and he wont care.the project is not hard just annoying n make sure u hook up smart people do well on the sim game
5264,Wayne  Grossman,nice guy a little weird but not in a bad way not much work at all two tests one project and the sim game curved the midterm graded project a little harsh but i guess we got what we deserved
5265,Wayne  Grossman,easy guy study the powerpoint slidesmemorize them thats where his tests will come from.class can be u can use the computer throughout class get other things done no hw just in class grp projects group presentatio
5266,Wayne  Grossman,class that boring study the powerpoint slides and show up to class and do fine group project was easy
5267,Wayne  Grossman,great professor pay attention to power points and study off of them listen during lecture and you will do fine attendd class
5268,Wayne  Grossman,this professor is great his tests as long as you study are easy everything is in powerpoint presentations if you have questions you can ask pay attention and get an a
5269,Wayne  Grossman,i dont know what these other reviews are talking about this guy sucks mid term final and presentation tests are so hard trust me im a smart guy at least you can use the computer all class though
5270,Wayne  Grossman,good guy tests are easy just study the powerpoint notes and you will do fine not as bad as these other reviews make him seem class is boring but he does not care if you use the computer the whole class
5271,Wayne  Grossman,not a bad professor takes attendance for every class presentation exams are easy mc short essays
5272,Wayne  Grossman,average u can go online all class mini presentation tests mc plus essay not bad gotta study on ur own tho because you learn nothing in class
5273,Sheryl  Gifford,she gave me depression
5274,Sheryl  Gifford,i found this professor really inspiring poetry is a difficult subject and she handled it beautifully
5275,Sheryl  Gifford,i absolutely loved her her lectures were interesting and i actually enjoyed going to class the down side is that there are quite a lot of papers assigned throughout the semester however she does a good job with feedback in order to improve your grade i did find that she can be a tough grader but if you put in effort do fine i got an a
5276,Sheryl  Gifford,she is willing to work with you and helps you the class is paper based and make sure to do them and use the criticism to improve your writing
5277,Sheryl  Gifford,awful professor no clear plan and disorganized take too long to grade papers stay away if you can
5278,Sheryl  Gifford,i really enjoyed her class i undertood her teaching style she was clear in her directoins and she helped me become a better writer overall she does asign a lot of papers but she grades quite easy in my opinion i would take her again
5279,Sheryl  Gifford,she is not a good professor class would be so pointless showing up very late at submitting grades she is super nice and funny and class is very chill but as a professor she is horrible her grading is not clear she changes things last minute and before you know it class is cancelled take her if you have to
5280,Sheryl  Gifford,worst professor ever this class was credits but been she gives too much homework makes you do a group project where you interview other professors students she gives too many long papers for this one project some papers not even related to our project she is the only teacher that waits until the last day to submit grades
5281,Sheryl  Gifford,very disorganized and unprepared she never passes back your assignments to show you your grades and she post midterm grades so you basically need to guess how well doing the whole semester she made everyone come to class the day before thanksgiving break just to tell everyone minutes into class that she will cancel it
5282,Sheryl  Gifford,absolutely horrible professor terrible temperament and very unclear about assignments she makes everything as complicated as possible seemingly in attempts to trip up students very unwilling to help students when confused and simply has no consideration for anyone other than attractive male students in the class avoid her at all costs
5283,Sheryl  Gifford,professor sheryl gifford is an average instructor she provides you with positive feedback and truly does care about how you end the semester yet she is not the most organized she is constantly pushing back dates when she is supposed to hand back final drafts and does not post grades on blackboard so you basically have to calculate your grade
5284,Sheryl  Gifford,a very tough grader she wants essays done very specifically to the style of her liking and not very clear about exactly what she wants she is somewhat helpful
5285,Sheryl  Gifford,she has a very specific way she wants you to write your essays especially for lit2010 i would not say she is very clear most of the time she confused me because she would condradict everything she said this made it hard for me to write my essays
5286,Sheryl  Gifford,shes a very nice lady who likes to crack some semifunny jokes she is not a tough grader and is always willing to help especially if you go to office hours class just consists of peer reviews which is fairly simple
5287,Sheryl  Gifford,take advantage of the peer reviews she helps comes up with ideas for the topics papers are only pages long but they make you think
5288,Sheryl  Gifford,absolutely love dr gifford she is such a nice and helpful professor i had no problems with her and she explains papers so clearly her essays for only had to pages long she is there to help if needed attendance is a major part of your grade so go to class
5289,Sheryl  Gifford,dr gifford is one of better teachers she is very approachable and clear there were no tests only a group project which was not so bad there are a couple of readerresponse assignments and an page paper at the end of the semester it was a very interesting class and if you have to take it you will not regret taking her class
5290,Sheryl  Gifford,class seems overwhelming but not only papers if you take it in her week summer class i got a and did everything the night before she is super nice and sweet just me it look like you care and you will do amazing just but little effort in
5291,Sheryl  Gifford,please take her if you can she made writing so much fun she offered lots of helps on your papers.she wants everyone to succeed in her class she often go above and beyond for her students the best english teacher i had
5292,Sheryl  Gifford,great professor helps with everything take her great with feed back amazing all around
5293,William  Brooks,in my opinion this class was not difficult at all as long as you actually studied and prepared well for his iclicker quizzes his test questions are very direct and fair you need to buy his textbook just his lecture book so that you can write notes in it yes he does have strict rules but very funny and makes lectures entertaining
5294,William  Brooks,his lectures will either bore you out of your mind or have you laughing every minutes quite entertaining and really funny during lectures however very strict he has a very strict policy about cell phones or any electronics for that matter and i suggest not even thinking twice about using it during lectures
5295,William  Brooks,go to class random quizzes for attendances class is grades by points no phones follow his rules and you will be fine dont buy the textbook his notes are online test are the notes he uses clickers he sends emails thing that you need to read print them them to class they might be for extra credit
5296,William  Brooks,i had dr brooks for bsc and he is very knowledgeable in what he teaches on the exams his word choices are very tricky so when studying for the exams make sure you are very certain in what studying otherwise the wording could potentially trick you he gives unannounced quizzes so study before each lecture
5297,William  Brooks,brooks is not a good professor he lectures very heavy and if you pay attention you pass tends to make fun of students and can be funny at times but other times he takes his jokes too far to the point where he is very disrespectful he will not change the way he teaches the course so bother taking him for biodiversity
5298,William  Brooks,very funny during lectures keeps you engaged for the most part and makes everything easy to understand took him for both bio principles and bio diversity and glad i did go to the lectures everything he says during lecture is fair game for the exams which are a bit difficult but if you pay attention and do what he asks have no problem
5299,William  Brooks,professor brooks is a character i had him for both bioprincipals and biodiversity attend every lecture read the lecture notebook before class and do fine his exams too difficult and in my opinion were pretty direct his lectures are enjoyable but beware very strict no phones no laptops no technology whatsoever
5300,William  Brooks,if you want to study and i mean really study for the tests do not take him you will not pass funny and makes lectures atleast interesting but he is very strict and class is mandatory want to go anyways not a class you learn on your own you will need iclicker for random quizes that need to prestudy for solid choice
5301,William  Brooks,super intimidating at first and then you see he really tries to make the entire lecture time engaging be late talk during his lecture and turn off electronics for real tests are fair lots of pop quizzes so make sure you read topics ahead of time or regret it and he offers many extra credit opportunities
5302,William  Brooks,seems intimidating at first but just jokes around a lot he tries his best to make boring topics interesting so you fall asleep read ahead before class because he likes giving pop quizzes and a lot of the time the same questions come back on exams
5303,William  Brooks,a little rude but if you show up to class be fine ohh just be late
5304,William  Brooks,this legend was the highlight of my first semester loud funny and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun he literally says going to be on the tests this class was extremely easy just occasionally review i crammed the exams and still got on all of them dr frazier is just too boring just avoid her
5305,William  Brooks,one of the best professors ever had his lectures are so entertaining that even when mindnumbingly topics like botany present themselves he manages to grasp your attention i recommend him to anyone that wants to have an incredibly clear understanding of biology while laughing the entire time
5306,William  Brooks,this is one of the best professors i have had at this school his lectures are very straight forward and if you take good notes and study there is no reason you pass it is also an added bonus that he is extremely funny and really engages the class his exams are fair and a lot of times he will hint at questions he will ask during lecture
5307,William  Brooks,brooks has been my favorite professor at fau so far i am a biology major so this class is important to me but he made the class enjoyable even though the tests were rough just need to study well and do fine
5308,William  Brooks,the goat
5309,William  Brooks,personally loved this class low key funny so not that boring he tells you exactly whats on the test if you go to class buy or read the textbook buy his little brown book instead study his powerpoints and that book and the stuff he says in class and not that hard if you pay attention in class might call you
5310,William  Brooks,dr brooks is an amazing teacher i had him for biodiversity and i learn so much and his lectures were never boring he actually teaches yet you have to put on your part to do well in class
5311,William  Brooks,i took brooks for bsc1010 as well same textbook that i never opened read the ppts take notes on what he lectures go to classes and study for iclicker quizzes they are pop quizzes not scheduled exams often have a few freebies but they are very long study well
5312,William  Brooks,do not buy the workbook this class is an easy a students who pass are the ones who study the night before if you get an a in this course you are not ready for upper level science courses also do not be late not even a second literally
5313,Gamble,dr gamble does a good job of not working you too hard i have her for an am and she does her best trying to get everyone to work together all in all she knows what she is doing and grades very very easy all you have to do is rewrite something with her suggestions and she is more than willing to give you a better grade than before
5314,Gamble,great professor loved her so much i am taking her again for lit easy grader wonderful personality highly recommended
5315,Gamble,i had dr gamble for wrt and absolutely loved her so i took her again for wrt she is the nicest woman and so intelligent too she is a fairly decent grader but you need to put effort into your papers she is by far one of the best teachers here you will love her
5316,Gamble,awesome woman very easygoing easy grader good sense of humor enjoys what she does would definitely recommend her and take her again
5317,Gamble,a great teacher she goes over the assignments you have to do and not that hard to begin with recommend her to anyone
5318,Gamble,great prof was an easy teacher and had fun discussions papers were easy and she is very fair with grading understanding and helpful sometimes unclear with assignment due dates so pay attention to those take her again in a heartbeat
5319,Gamble,very sweet lady material is so easy to get through and tests are cake aced all exams and papers as long as you can write fairly well and do the readings easy a
5320,Gamble,nice lady easy papers fair grader makes writing fun take the class u wont regret
5321,Gamble,shes awesome great teacher easy a all you have to do is hand in a paper once in a while willing to help easygoing
5322,Gamble,easy only read a few stories adn aced tests as long as your not stupid should be albe to pass class an a or b
5323,Gamble,very very very nice lady easy on the workload and a fair grader i would def recommend
5324,Gamble,awesome and fair if you get an a or b in her class something is wrong with you
5325,Gamble,very clear with expectations she is always willing to help you lose in this class the best
5326,Gamble,very nice lady and easy grader class is a little boring but worth it an easy a
5327,Gamble,very good prof i enjoyed the class and did fairly well just dont fall behind on the stories her tests are fairly difficult
5328,Gamble,she is a very sweet and kind woman you can tell that she loves her job and she makes little jokes at times that are funny but not laugh out loud its in the morning i have a hangover funny but i loved the class and loved the teacher
5329,Gamble,she is a very easy teacher if you need help she always has time avaliable to help you out word to the wise if you want an a in the class go to her before you hand in your paper and let her proof it she is also very nice and kind
5330,Gamble,you dont have to participate in class she pretty much talks the entire time can be pretty boring her tests are harder then you would think based on her class she also likes her opinions on papers and will lower your grade if she doesnt agree with your
5331,Gamble,a really nice lady the stuff she assigns to read is not long and relatively entertaining if someone who does fairly well in reading however it may remind you of grade english a little too easy can mean boring
5332,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,i have taken three classes from professor murphylee at uwmilwaukee and absolutely love her as long as you attend class and do the readings this class will be easy peasy she literally goes over word for word the answers you will need to write your papers and take your exams she will help you endlessly so long as you ask definitely recommend
5333,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,she is at uwm i have taken her non language classes attendance is important in her class tho with a valid reason you can miss some you will have an assinment every week a quiz in some classes every week and papers and exams its not an easy a but if you do the work participate you should get an a an awesome teacher
5334,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,i took this class at the university of wisconsin milwaukee with her a class about vampires and it is really interesting but take it if you just want an easy course that involve much if you like to read and write than it will be super easy be sure to show up to class though
5335,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,this is one of the worst classes i took at the u of a the teacher is really biased in teaching she talks a lot about her opinion not anything interesting or useful try to get a better trad you need to goto class take notes everyday writting pages and test and a final test are easy questions but the other are hard
5336,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,i loved this class no it is not an a handed to you yes you do have to work and wake up its professor murphylee is always enthusiastic about her subject sometimes it gets boring because the class moves too slowly for people who know history easy if you do the work honors section easy as all get out do it for cr
5337,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,hard class do not take i heard it was easy but it most certainly was not
5338,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,the class was supposed to be easy but definitely changed it everything is graded harshly for a trad and she wastes a good half hr of students time at the beginning of class then makes you stay till the very end the sad part is she is a really nice person and open to helping you but her class is boring and too hard for a gened
5339,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,i thought this class was really easy yes the essays can be graded hard depending on your ta she is too perky for me but at least she knows what talking about just go to class and do fine
5340,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,this class is aweful i was told it was so easy but it definitey is not you must earn your grades and the essays are graded soo hard she knows what she is talking about but she is so uninteresting russian is boring and i hate coming to this class attendance quizzes are frequent and they suck i hate this class
5341,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,a very friendly and helpful professor memorizing names and dates can be a bit boring and difficult but besides that the class is fun interesting and relatively easy honors section is enjoyable due to the relaxed discussions we have about assorted studentpicked topics pertaining to russia
5342,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,this class rocks i love because of it i could have got an a in this course when i was two great friendly teacher
5343,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,i think shes very good its just the class which causes problems it helps when people print out the notes so they arent asking stupid questions the honors section is really fun because we can talk about different topics from any time period in russia that we pick
5344,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,professor murpheylee is fantastic she is so unbelievably caring and helpful willing to help you in any way as long as you ask even if history is not your thing she makes it really fascinating and has an infectious enthusiasm for the topic this class was recommended to me by so many people who had taken it in the past.take their advice
5345,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,murphylee is awesome really easy but at the same time you definitely learn a lot i would highly recommend her to anyone awesome and her class is awesome
5346,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,wow this class is ridiculously easy i feel like in the fourth grade i know whether a product of good teaching or what a very nice person though and the honors section is a little more interesting and challenging
5347,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,easiest class ever been in
5348,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,she was such a good teacher she really wanted yo uto do well and would help you wiht anything you had a question on the tests were easy becasue she gave you every answer in the lectures
5349,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,no comments
5350,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,as long as you go to class the easiest class ever take i do a single assigned reading assignment sad i wasted my money buying the books pretty interesting too in my opinion
5351,Meghan  Murphy-Lee,very nice person and i learned so much i thought this class was going to be boring but it it was very interesting to learn about history and i usually hate history classes easy a as well highly recommend this class
5352,Jan  Tarski,dont take this teacher if you have trouble with math i had to spend a lot of extra time in the math lab because his lessons were so unclear i ended up dropping the class and just taking an online course would not recommend this professor to anyone avoid if possible
5353,Jan  Tarski,got a heavy accent that you can get used to if you try hard enough very nice but not very clear i thought i was gonna fail the class but i ended up with a c i go out of my way to take this class but i also be scared away from the bad reviews its very passable
5354,Jan  Tarski,he is such a sweet guy every second week there is a test but it is open notes
5355,Jan  Tarski,seriously anyone who complains is someone who just care j tarski is a little hard to understand but you get passed it after he has such a big heart tried his best to answer any questions to the best of his ability he also encourages the math res center open note take him if serious about learning
5356,Jan  Tarski,very sweet old man intelligent too but is difficult to understand without following along in the book reasonable homework requirements and tests that relate directly to lessons and homework you have to stay the entire class time if willing to put in the effort to learn outside of class open note tests
5357,Jan  Tarski,im not sure if he still teaches but this guy is a incredibly smart he is a bit hard to understand but if you ask questions you will understand he is a very reasonable guy i despited a test grade and he was very nice and open minded about it and ended up changing it stay after class to help you too i wish he tough more classes
5358,Jan  Tarski,he is a really great person if you go to his class everyday he will help you more but he is a little old so hard to understand
5359,Jan  Tarski,good teacher helpful if you are here to learn about stats he can help you understand it by simplifying it i get his class and easy to understand though i worry about his health listen to complain about him because they have no interest in math and does not know any bad teacher i would recommend him to my friends
5360,Jan  Tarski,mr tarski is old and hard to understand becuase of his accent but he is really nice he comutes all the way from berkely by bus and is willing to come in on extra days just to help his students the quizes are open book and you are allowed to use hand written notes if you come to class try and ask for help he will definatley give you the letter g
5361,Jan  Tarski,not a math wiz but mr t makes everything quite easy for his students come to class take notes take the quizzes points each then take an almost identical test the next class after a nice review of the quiz notes are allowed for all quizzes although he is sometimes hard to understand the textbook and his teaching method make it easy
5362,Jan  Tarski,this heart is in the right place for sure but unfortunately very difficult to understand he answer questions clearly and talks to the board if you show an interest in his class he will be very lenient with you in terms of grading etc take this class if you are already good at math and you will get an a otherwise bad
5363,Jan  Tarski,one of the best teachers i am a total retard when it comes to math but i got an a at the end
5364,Jan  Tarski,if you have a hard time with math do not take this class he help clear up questions and will just move on to the next section he explain what he is doing he just works a problem on the board in small writing and then moves on always late even on test days
5365,Jan  Tarski,easy class nice professor i feel bad for him because everyone takes advantage and talked during his class and those are the ones who fail so their fault he has office hours and can talk to you after class if you have trouble i learned a lot good class
5366,Jan  Tarski,though he is hard to understand sometimes he really knows his stuff if you do the homework and take notes in class you will be able to overcome the confusion most students experience
5367,Jan  Tarski,i signed up for this statistics class in the summer he was teaching methods were so unclear that i had to drop the class after two days i do not recommend taking this class with this professor after all you want to learn the subject as it is a good tool for business
5368,Jan  Tarski,i feel bad cuz everyone clowns on him and takes advantage of him he is a good professor although the class is not very organized the tests and quizzes are similar and he gives the quiz days before the exam hw optional take why not
5369,Jan  Tarski,i hate statistics like a foreign language only specialists use it but tarski is clearly a statistical expert because he taught me stats and i actually understood a good amount of the topics the course seems extremely hard but i pulled through with an a
5370,Jan  Tarski,worst teacher ever he not only has a thick accent but speaks to the board he assigns a used car project and explains nothing about it no help what so ever do not take
5371,Jan  Tarski,take this class for the people that stated hard he grades hard you cant understand him yaddy yadda yahh your the ones that either a tried to learn in his class and get a passing grade b know anyone from his past classes or c both a and b for me i was neither find someone from his past classes and use the tests they
5372,Seth  Ovadia,are you kidding me this guy is a prick he busted me for plagiarism after i asked him to look over my paper his class is so boring and a lot of notes this guys sucks these people dont know what they are talking about
5373,Seth  Ovadia,dr ovadia is one cool guy the class is mainly a discussion forum as opposed to a lecture just read books and talk about them as well as a short reaction paper after each book you have to talk in class though he took everyone to starbucks on the first day and paid awesome guy definately take him
5374,Seth  Ovadia,the class is easy but notes are very important a chimp could get an a on his quizes the papers do require some effort he has a good sense of humor but tends to distance himself from his students
5375,Seth  Ovadia,class was interesting three quizzes and he gives you a study guide for each the quizzes are taken directly from the study guide take good notes and miss class and get a good grade three papersthe final is one of the papers final paper was hard and made you think i suggest you start thinking of the paper early
5376,Seth  Ovadia,fantastic this class teaches you a lot about the finer points in sociological theories take this calss only if you are interested in sociology theories i would definitely recommend him over the other soci professor tests are super easy papers a little trickier take lots of notes and miss class and do great
5377,Seth  Ovadia,this class is hard if i can get through it anyone can he only takes attendance for the first two weeks he is very helpful outside of the classroom though
5378,Seth  Ovadia,this could be my best college course experience dr ovadia is a great teacher and wonderful outside of class as well the class is challenging but not at all impossible if willing to show up pay attention and study good balance of fair workload and always willing to help
5379,Seth  Ovadia,lectures explain reading well and you can choose topics for your papers only expect to leave class early be prepared to take notes overall not bad prof
5380,Seth  Ovadia,very nice professor class is very easy easy papers midterm and final gives review sheet for on the review is on the midterm only one problemway too many articles you definitely go wrong if you take him he is definetly recommended
5381,Seth  Ovadia,ovadia is a great professor and definately the one to take for theory obviously the class is really hard but he does a great job of explaining all of the theories and theorists there are a couple of papers but they too hard and not too hard of a grader great teacher
5382,Seth  Ovadia,i had him for and really like it but loved him for theory he explains everything so well very detailed and helpful a lot of information to learn but he will help be sure to have him look at your paper before you turn it in it will really help
5383,Seth  Ovadia,he is an awesome teacher he makes it easy to learn and tries to help you as much as possible tests papers def take him really nice and cares a lot taking him again next semester
5384,Seth  Ovadia,relatively easy class never takes attendance have to do the readings if you go to the lectures explains concepts well not very insightful in answering questions though three papers and exams easy a is you participate
5385,Seth  Ovadia,this is one of those classes i was afraid to take but he made it so nice he goes out of his way to explain things and engage class some of the material is boring but overall i think it has been pretty take another of his classes
5386,Seth  Ovadia,explains the rather difficult readings very well and is always open to student input a couple of papers quizzes and an exam overall i enjoyed the class
5387,Seth  Ovadia,nice guy very excited about class but boring at times
5388,Seth  Ovadia,this class was so boring he has very distracting mannerisms he will say ya know times every min
5389,Seth  Ovadia,papers exams pretty easy class and a nice guy and knows what talking about
5390,Seth  Ovadia,sounds like it could be a good class until you get there the way he teaches is terrible
5391,Seth  Ovadia,could be a very interesting class but its not at all soo boring he stutters a lot and doesnt give good feedback to students comments and questions in class
5392,Mark  Sirkin,he is very disrespectful towards students and will not answer questions also will reprimand students for taking bathroom breaks tests were easy but the material was monotonous one of the few classes where i did not learn anything new
5393,Mark  Sirkin,class was ridiculously easy an easy a if you care enough to do the work and pay some attention dr sirkin seems gruff but is actually a very nice guy he just expects students to act like adults and take their work seriously makes sense to me if you mature enough to be responsible you probably like his class though
5394,Mark  Sirkin,seriously go to class if you your screwed do exactly what he says and you will get an a i have no idea how people can not get atleast a b he practically gives you the answers funny enjoyable dont care for people that dont come to class gives attendence times a class period
5395,Mark  Sirkin,open book open notes but still not very east he wrote the book so if you get it in class and you ask and he just looks at you like dumb you figure it out at home cause he wrote the book blackmailed into taking him he tries but not very good with effort a b i think the class is just so he can feel important
5396,Mark  Sirkin,tries a bit too much to be humorous but he can be pleasant he does not allow you to leave the class and stares if you come in just a minute late tests could be a bit more clear do not challenge him to be wrong because he gets very irate one student took a test but sirkin lost it despite the room supporting him he still kicked the student out
5397,Mark  Sirkin,this class is fairly easy make sure you come to every class and pay attention his exams that difficult but he is fairly strict and tolerate messing around also pretty funny
5398,Mark  Sirkin,if you are not good at math and would require the help of a professor with a pleasant attidute who gives a damn whether or not you understand the information take anything but this class with this guy misery loves company
5399,Mark  Sirkin,not a bad class if you have the right attitude in fact if you come to class and care about what you do its pretty easy act like an adult and treat the professor with respect and find a very nice man the text looked overwhelming but it really just basic algebra
5400,Mark  Sirkin,not very helpful had him twice and both times he helped when asked he thinks he knows everything but he misses a lot really stick to the syllabus as far as a daily break down in what is going on in the class
5401,Mark  Sirkin,open book open note tests tells a lot of corny jokes but a good teacher make sure you drift off when he goes into one of his stories because he picks right back up into the lesson
5402,Mark  Sirkin,as a professor he does his bes but the problem is that many liberal art students must take this course to fulfill research requirements but interested in it tests bad i like his jokes feels like in good old commedy show
5403,Mark  Sirkin,tests are open book so i mean that is helpful but the material sucks and aside the fact he keep on the topic at hand for long or he does for too long sucks when he wrote the textbook so he thinks that he knows all
5404,Mark  Sirkin,yes this guy is old has bad jokes but his test are open book how bad can it be material is somewhat interesting just hang in there not as bad as you think
5405,Mark  Sirkin,horrible teacher doesnt know how to grade and is very biased
5406,Mark  Sirkin,he doesnt teach the material and actually fell asleep during a presentation just like in grade school he does not allow you to get up to go to the bathroom during class and wont let you tape record him it wont take you long to figure out
5407,Mark  Sirkin,awesome professor unique way to teach statistic principles tough teacher but if you like a guy who doesnt put up with any crap this is your guy those who rated him poorly probably did so because they did poorly in class
5408,Mark  Sirkin,if you like to experience someone who is rude then this is the professor for you be very afraid to ask him a question he like it if you are going to be tardy look out he will stop class and embarrass you and whatever you do get c
5409,Mark  Sirkin,very rude and only wants to talk about how smart he is like being in higschool because you have to show up and he yells if you need to leave early and freaks out if you whisper or your cell phone goes off
5410,Mark  Sirkin,he is alright but he makes way to many stupid jokes he should spend more time teaching
5411,Mark  Sirkin,he gets off on a tangent and wastes tons of class time but takes attendence so you have to sit through listening to him tell about his brotherinlaw buy a suit not joking
5412,Annis  Golden,if you like being indecisive looked at with disdane or feeling as if its the style of sitting in the back of the class then this is the route for you this class will def give you that push that you want
5413,Annis  Golden,dr golden is a very nice person but the class material was pretty boring i never thought it would be possible to take attendance in lc18 but acom proved me wrong this class made me loose interest in com major but she gives lots of opportunities for bonus points and stuff i got an a study hard and ok and always go to class
5414,Annis  Golden,this class was quite boring but easy if you use the lecture outlines on webct golden tends to ramble and get wordy in test questions but she is always willing to answer questions in class
5415,Annis  Golden,this class is so boring and is the only time heard of attendance in a lecture center if you have something to do in class not so bad studyguides are posted online before tests but some of the exam questions are unclear discussion sections are pure torture
5416,Annis  Golden,attendance is mandatory is this class prof lectures are pretty dry compared to that of professor halkowski prof golden is very approachable and would often show up early and wait outside the lc and talk with students outside of class
5417,Annis  Golden,attendance is mandatory even in a person lecture hall there are course assistants in every row to make sure there class is relatively boring with her but worth it for the attendance it can really bring your grade up bring lecture notes to class and discussion it really makes everything much easier
5418,Annis  Golden,she was just really boring and did not keep my attention at all
5419,Annis  Golden,she will put the lecture outlines online and tell you to print them and bring them to class do it if you take notes on the outlines it is much easier to follow the test questions are based a lot on the lecture objectives if you read the objectives and can answer them you will do really well follow this advice
5420,Annis  Golden,ehh this class is arite shes a pretty good teacher trys to make the class somewhat amusing shows some pretty good movie clips tests arent that easy though so study
5421,Annis  Golden,prof golden was the most helpful teacher i have ever had i missed some tests and she let me write papers to make up for it class is pretty easy straight forward
5422,Annis  Golden,lectures are boring as hell for many some find her helpful first year they implemented discussion sections they were much more helpful than lectures all notes are on webct a great help she responds to webct questions quickly and clearly texts are a waste
5423,Annis  Golden,so what if the class is boring but she makes up for it by providing a very detailed study guide and helpful notes attendance is a must and it can your average there is a discussion group with every friday and it helps you to have a better understanding of what you are learning
5424,Annis  Golden,if you read the lecture outlines you will be ok in the course there are like books all pretty small but it is very helpful to read them
5425,Annis  Golden,no comments
5426,Annis  Golden,she reads right off the notes no use going to class it is so boring but of your grade goes to attendance so better bring a book or something
5427,Annis  Golden,she is a tough teacher you definitely have to work for your grade she explains everything thoroughly and is looking out for her best interests
5428,Liz  Stanley,no comments

5430,Liz  Stanley,liz is so sweet

5446,David  Breiner,he is the best teacher ever while his tests are hard you learn a lot he is very very helpful when it comes to your projects he is just simply the best
5447,David  Breiner,do not take this class at lights off slideshow just asking for naptime otherwise he is very organized and tries very hard to help his students very tough grader though be sure to take very good notes
5448,David  Breiner,his version of a grading curve he gave everyone one point praise the lord very helpful though in terms of a human being one of the most compasionate teachers had in a long time
5449,David  Breiner,great professor very organized the ultimate professional
5450,Michael  Milburn,i took psych comm society prof milburn online the material he provides is very interesting and i really enjoyed the class he is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great the class is very straightforward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly the work load is fair if you do the work you will do well
5451,Michael  Milburn,this class was online and it too bad my only complaint is the final exam it is ridiculous and unlike other papers i have had to write before did not enjoy that at all
5452,Michael  Milburn,he was very accessible always gave feedback and answered very fast i took this course online so not sure how entertaining he is but i did not have a problem with this course even though it was my first online course you have to submit online discussions every single week grading for all assignments is clear
5453,Michael  Milburn,easy a the difficult part is willing yourself to go to class interesting topics but he makes it boring the papers are challenging as it is impossible to write a perfect paper in pages double spaced while cramming in studies they need to be longer which i cant believe i would want i would not take him again as i found it hard not to skip
5454,Michael  Milburn,he knows the material but presents is in a dry manner the book is interesting but not necessary to get most readings are online attendance is taken and could help boost grade papers are worth small percentages tests worth more do the online practice tests read correct answers and do well ta is helpful
5455,Michael  Milburn,i find this class to be a breeze if you actually do the things he tells you to its an easy a or b the multiple choice questions are literally word for word from practice tests and his papers are very short and clear cut you follow the criteria and you get like i managed to do the lectures very interesting though
5456,Michael  Milburn,professor lectures can at times be dry due to his sometimes monotone voice but if you are interested in psychology there is no way to make this subject boring his exams are easy if you do the online quizzes which have all the answers in them most of the class got but due to poor work ethic he provides the way to an a
5457,Michael  Milburn,this professor needs to retire now i took his psych class and it was horrible boring lectures confusing material and not helpful the tests are really hard he gives you the ahead of time but expects you to memorize multiple choice questions and only chooses of them for the actual test dont take
5458,Michael  Milburn,worst professor ever hes def on my worst professor list this guy has so checked out of teaching its not even funny hes close to retirement and it shows he didnt even correct our papers he had his grad student do it so in reality we werent even writing for him because the grad student wasnt even correcting by his guidelines so boring
5459,Michael  Milburn,i took social psych from him professor milburn is one of the best professors that umb has i wish that have been able to take more of his classes work with him more closely take a class of his efore he retires
5460,Michael  Milburn,one of my favorite umb professors i wished he taught every psych course he has one book that he uses which is his own book and all of his other readings are online you are required to attend classes do the readings and do the mandatory posts for the readings every week aside from that you do paper a midterm and a final
5461,Michael  Milburn,he just know how to teach to a room of kids he relies completely on unclear vague powerpoints and his lectures are totally centered around describing studies very boring and misleadingly difficult also the tests are built around memorization this class discouraged me from pursuing a topic that i had been very interested in
5462,Michael  Milburn,good prof although when he talks about all the studies it can be a real snooze the papers are short and easy his exams r easy too if you take the practice exams
5463,Michael  Milburn,he is an amazing teacher there was no group work this semester unlike some of the other comments indicated there were tests all multiple choice and short answer the questions were given to us prior to the tests it made studying for the tests a piece of cake i liked the class he was able to keep a classroom of under control vry well
5464,Michael  Milburn,he tries hard to explain study after study but never quite puts everything into context he is enthusiastic about social psychology on a personal level and that really shines through but he is not a natural born teacher and that hurts his ability to pass on his enthusiasm effectively to the class always available for office hours very nice guy
5465,Michael  Milburn,all powerpoints and lecturing if you keep up with the reading not to bad has a few movies to watch through the semester tests kind of suck
5466,Michael  Milburn,he is a very good professor all you need to do is do the assignments and make sure you turn it in on time the exams were multiple choice and short essay the essay questions are usually given out a week before the actual test i think if you do all the work you should be fine excellent professor and very helpful
5467,Michael  Milburn,he does expect you to work if social psych is your thing he is your proff not for the feint of heart know that if your a loafer you will be spoted take other psych classes if you want to coast but if your intending to go into this feild he goes the extra mile for you
5468,Michael  Milburn,i have had several courses with this professor and i think he is excellent he is very demanding has a lot of reading but the tests are open book so if you are paying attention in class and do your work you will do very well i like his lecturing style he uses groups in his classes but you can do the papers on your own if you want
5469,Michael  Milburn,mixed feelings on this professor the work load was extremely difficult i hated the group component of the course it would have been very useful if our grade depend on it fair in his grading aside from the group grade and the subject matter is interesting the lectures were a bit dry and he expects a great deal workwise
5470,Steven  Schneider,excellent poet and critic enjoyed his east coast insights is married to a fabulous graphic artist and is proud of his accomplishments he makes his classes relative to what is happening in the world at large very erudite and knows his stuff loved his class
5471,Steven  Schneider,i took online pretty difficult a lot of discussions and reading and writing barely passed
5472,Steven  Schneider,awesome professor first class i took online and it was a great experience we read small books and they were easy to read and interesting take him highly recommend
5473,Steven  Schneider,professor schneider is very enthusiastic about the subject he teaches you need to get the books and read because he does give quizzes attendance is mandatory good professor as long as you study and participate you should do well good luck
5474,Steven  Schneider,miss his but do not worry he warns you in advance we had to buy different novels i suggest getting them early because many student had a hard time finding them toward the end of the session i got a b his are easy just read the books his mid term and final consist of an essay and questions
5475,Steven  Schneider,i thought he was a great professor we only had three paper assignments which were fairly easy as long as you did the required reading during the class the papers were not long at all and our final was really really easy i would definately take him again listen to these other ratings he is a good professor
5476,Steven  Schneider,i learned to hate the language i already know he holds a chair in the dept he lets you know at the beginning of every lecture however what chair exactly i do not know very very unprofessional and pompous
5477,Steven  Schneider,no comments
5478,Steven  Schneider,i know how anyone could say anything negative about this prof such an honor to have a nationally recognized poet heading up the utpa english dept yet very unassuming and easily approachable if a person needs help i highly recommend him to anyone trying to learn to write poetry he helped me enormously
5479,Steven  Schneider,no comments
5480,Steven  Schneider,pretty good prof take attendance or anything if you read the books the quizzes are super easy the class discussions were very interesting coming from somebody who read or favor english too much i enjoyed the class a lot
5481,Steven  Schneider,you do learn about poetry if your thing he has a minor speech defect that sometimes interferes with his lectures which could turn you off to his seminars it bother me talks a about his family in class
5482,Steven  Schneider,really nice guy down to earth gives easy quizzes and intermedeiately easy tests which include half multiple choice and half essay not too demanding considering he is an english teacher highly recommended
5483,Anton  Armstrong,dr a is an amazing director he will push you and others in the choir harder than any other director you will learn how to make near flawless music for the purpose of delivering beautiful texts and messages a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with a musician of his calibre
5484,Anton  Armstrong,if you care about your voice and are okay with being exploited by your colleges pr department then this choir is perfect for you but really way overhyped the straighttone blending and the schedule are antithetical to a healthy singing technique
5485,Anton  Armstrong,awful professor late more than not actually teach just tells stories about how great he is worst class i have taken at st olaf
5486,Anton  Armstrong,i will acknowledge that a fantastic conductor however he is lacking as a professor perpetually late and mostly talks about himself rather than the subject matter
5487,Anton  Armstrong,dr armstrong is favorable to the students that are in the st olaf choir if you are not in choir expect to get a lower grade plain and simple also i feel that i learned as much as i could have because dr armstrong was so busy telling the class anecdotes of how influenced people instead of actually teaching
5488,Anton  Armstrong,amazing conductor he truly loves what he does and is so inspiring to everyone in the choir he truly cares about each and everyone of us
5489,Anton  Armstrong,very thoughtful guy he is not very approachable but he loves each an every one of his students some people connect with him better than others i always believed that we were very similar so i think this kept us from getting to know each other better an honest hard working man
5490,Anton  Armstrong,pulls it all together
5491,Anton  Armstrong,unbelievable so inspiring and heartfelt his eyes just light up and everyone sings their hearts out for him an amazing experience
5492,Anton  Armstrong,no comments
5493,Anton  Armstrong,simply the best
5494,Anton  Armstrong,i am in dr collegiate chorale it really does prepare singers for sophomore year and beyond hopefully for st olaf choir i love dr warmups and his choice of repertoire for fall semester what a wonderful director
5495,Anton  Armstrong,i had dr a for conducting and he was very clear and a great prof but definitely challenging
5496,Anton  Armstrong,i had dr a for collegiate chorale a nonaudition choir and he was so kind and encouraging to us and helped us feel great and as a result sing well too
5497,Anton  Armstrong,no comments

5542,Carol  Topping,topping is an amazing professor she is full of hilarious stories and will make you laugh every class she is super kind and easy to talk to i am taking her courses again this fall

5556,Roberto  Calderon,do not take this class if you want to waste your time spending minutes out of a minute class writing on the whiteboard saying nothing while writing is a waste of everyones time learning everything from si and just causes more trouble he grade anything only the do
5557,Roberto  Calderon,one of the nicest profs i have ever had very approachable outside of class and will work with you to help get the grades you want you definitely have to read so being lazy wont cut it all grades are essays which isnt too bad because he gives the questions a week ahead of time and goes through them in class lectures can be random but worth it
5558,Roberto  Calderon,his lectures can be boring at time all he does is lecture the entire time and the tests are essays based on mostly the text some on lecture however he is super approachable and willing to help as long as you ask he has been the most helpful professor had so far he wants all his students to succeed you just need to reach out to him
5559,Roberto  Calderon,midterm and final make up almost all of your grade tests are essay questions he gives you the class before the test he gives you questions but only two are on the test and you write about one the questions are confusingly worded and have multiple separate parts personally do not recommend
5560,Roberto  Calderon,this class was the longest class of my life lectures are extremely long he stands in front of a stand and reads the lectures to you the entire time go to the si sessions if they are available i learned everything from the si sessions he gives grades the entire semester midterm and final both you must write during class like a test
5561,Roberto  Calderon,teacher way heavy on the mid term and final exam both are strictly essay which was scary at first but he is super fair and an easy learn just have to listen to a lot of lecture
5562,Roberto  Calderon,nice guy but long lectures i had him for hours once a week most of the class was gone halfway through class is straight lecture with no powerpoint or visual aid so easy to zone out essay tests worth half your grade so outline and prepare well for those go to si sessions extra credit is offered but ya gotta be there
5563,Roberto  Calderon,very droning literally reading straight from a piece of paper a lot of interesting things have happened in history and he touches on none of them
5564,Roberto  Calderon,two tests make your grade for the entire class not bad but also not great both are essay questions and its kinda hard to get at what he really wants on his tests otherwise attendance isnt manditory however read the text does give extra credit but gotta be there
5565,Roberto  Calderon,professor calderon is a great teacher he really takes his time in explaining the material chicano history and makes time to meet with you in case you got questions i have taken several classes of his in the past and taking another one again great material and excellent professor
5566,Roberto  Calderon,go to class and read the assigned material and you have any problem with your grades in the class although he tends to go off into tangents about weird things sometimes so his lectures always the most interesting
5567,Roberto  Calderon,no comments
5568,Roberto  Calderon,rarely prepared for class has an extreme bias and his lectures are hell to muddle through suggest against his classes
5569,Roberto  Calderon,history of chicano education awesome info presented in class he knows his stuff sometimes has students volunteer to present some info to break up monotony of his lecturei think considerate no multiple choice here had essay exams and a few papers grading was fair and generous nice guy respects students very approachable and helpful
5570,Roberto  Calderon,worst teacher ever hates america for some reason
5571,Roberto  Calderon,dr calderon the preaching mexicanism his students are he is a great professor his classes are based on open discussions of the readings as long as you read the books you are fine pretty and did not want to take this class but had no option and still made a b
5572,Roberto  Calderon,great professor unless your either lazy or a great texts alot of chances to discuss lazy students stay away you have to actually work instead of sleep in class white students will object to a strong mexican american telling it like it is white but stomach
5573,Roberto  Calderon,should not be teaching very unorganized does the majority of teaching through the students giving presentations spends more time on soapbox blaming all of problems on white north americans
5574,Roberto  Calderon,does not teach if you are looking to learn something that you cannot already teach yourself do not take his class he is not helpful should not be teaching
5575,Roberto  Calderon,no comments
5576,Bob  Betts,dr betts is a wonderful teacher he is always willing to help if you need any clarification on anything really knows his stuff he makes you work for your grade but fair and clear on what looking for
5577,Bob  Betts,if you havent took sph this is the professor you need in your life professor betts is super funny but very professional he creates such a comforting environment in his class that makes it so much easier for speech days he tells you want he expects gives clear instructions for every speech group speech and also for the tests
5578,Bob  Betts,i was always so scared of public speaking but bob betts creates a classroom environment that takes away that anxiety he grades on content not nervous ticks or memorization super enjoyable class with fun assignments i would recommend to anyone taking a speech class
5579,Bob  Betts,took this last year but he was a very nice professor he was very helpful and if you do exactly as he instructed and follow his outline then youll be fine i was very anxious to take a public speaking class but i left the class becoming more confident in public speaking would recommend research matters a lot
5580,Bob  Betts,this professor made too many mistakes in his grading he was also was very unprofessional about it because he did not care to fix the grades unless you chased him down
5581,Bob  Betts,best one i have ever had speech is hard you have to practice regardless of the professor but if you do what he says each speech you write he checks on each person individually in class if you do exactly what he says when he gives you individual help and you practice you will pass easy hes really smart so just do what he says
5582,Bob  Betts,nice passionate helpful but tough grader for sure
5583,Bob  Betts,professor betts managed to make my first year of speech enjoyable rather than stressful and nerveracking he provided you with plenty of notice and instructions before each assigned speech he also did not require anyone to memorize their speech his focus is more on content and participation matters significantly in his class
5584,Bob  Betts,research is key to good grade make sure to show up be on time and take notes as best you can he loves class participation and questions and is very accessible via email and office hours he assign much in textbook but if you take the time to read the related chapters you will have a solid advantage
5585,Bob  Betts,show up do your research and do well
5586,Bob  Betts,he is probably one of the most picky professors i have ever met his grading is very inconsistent for one speech i used a visual aid in a way he liked for the next speech i did it in the same way and for some reason he did not like it and gave me a lower grade also tell you something is ok but then later you it is not
5587,Bob  Betts,a very specific grader but a great teacher if looking for a teacher that actually cares and makes class fun take professor betts yes awesome
5588,Bob  Betts,by far the worst teacher i had at rvc very condescending and often spoke to the students as if they were ignorant fools there are many different speech teachers you can take for a better experience please stay away there is no need to comment on the professional style of this professor in my experience there was none
5589,Bob  Betts,he has set ideas politically and if your speech happens to conflict with his beliefs your grade will reflect it even if your research is extensive discredit it because he agree with your point i feel like people who side with him politically love him because he grades to encourage his beliefs so much for open
5590,Bob  Betts,great teacher very enthusiastic and genuinely cares about his students great guy one of my favorite teachers had
5591,Bob  Betts,i enjoyed his class and sense of humor total speeches indivual and group mid term and final are tough
5592,Bob  Betts,great prof hotness irrelevant here to learn and get degree got a b worked hard but found his influence next qtr when had to do a speech in a class i was actually comfortable doing a speech finally thanks to prof betts well worth the time and made it fun great prof kudos to betts for doing a great job and being patient and kind tough
5593,Bob  Betts,i consider myself a speaker with professional training through the military as a briefer and i received a very high b other students that i felt were weak received and he seems to grade you off of your individual potential instead of grading you off of the other students this will benefit a weak speaker and hurt a charismatic person
5594,Bob  Betts,as someone who is downright scared of public speaking i found his class to be very welcoming and helpful i learned tons of pointers and figured out how to make my speeches concise and effective professor betts made my four week summer speech course bearable by being a helpful friendly guy he is tothepoint but not harsh great guy
5595,Bob  Betts,mr betts is really into helping students become all they are capable of a shy person and hate public speaking he realizes this and grades accordingly he let you slip by but grades you low enough to push you to progress i think all it takes to be successful is your own willpower and motivation not being a good speaker

5620,Tanya  Cassidy,i think making us go to the cemetery and observe froze my ass off not to mention creeped me out i spent hours on her assignments when i could have taken a much easier course she is approachable and nice just thinks that her class is our on
5621,Tanya  Cassidy,for a second year sociology course i thought she asked for quite a bit more than any other soc class i had taken because so many people complained she made the final super easy but her teaching style is often difficult to follow
5622,Tanya  Cassidy,very brutal expects too much
5623,Tanya  Cassidy,very nice prof she is very reachable and helpful very good class notes all online both courses were interesting she is one of the hard working prof
5624,Tanya  Cassidy,nice person soc of everyday life was real confusing and most of the time i had no clue what she was talking about in class would like to have her again she tried her best

5629,Tanya  Cassidy,awesome course and an awesome teacher totally reccomend her to anyone in sociology
5630,Tanya  Cassidy,very clear lectures she is amazing
5631,Valerie  Martin,mrs martin is approachable and supportive if you are struggling or challenged by utilizing computer systems
5632,Valerie  Martin,a useful course for those who are preparing to find a spot in the marketplace.students learn to navigate through real world current relevant scenarios.the course gets a boost with the inclusion of periodic lectures talks with industry gurus.with so much happening in the cyberspace the course have been introduced at a better time
5633,Valerie  Martin,she is a very nice easy teacher she will help you and give you time to get projects done however there was no method to her madness as far as how projects were weighted but didnt really natter because as long as you did it fairly well you got an a
5634,Valerie  Martin,mrs martin was by far one of the most engaging most dedicated and most valuable teachers that ever had and i have had some very incredible professors any student that goes through her classroom is the better for doing so
5635,Valerie  Martin,very fun class i definitely recommend it
5636,Valerie  Martin,she works with anyone who needs help very friendly corny jokes but has a sense of humor not too strict when it comes to grading show effort and she will take notice of this btw she is not hot

5640,Mark  Damen,professor damen is one of the most enthusiastic professors you will have you can tell he loves what he is lecturing about and it makes the class bearable he is clear on what he expects papers to look like and what the test material will be on if you need to take a history credit take this one
5641,Mark  Damen,professor damen is a really kind and energetic professor however his grading criteria is so hard to understand he use canvas and your grade is basically unknown to you until a few weeks before the semester tests are all fill in the blank but good luck because hard lots of papers with very specific formatting and writing style
5642,Mark  Damen,dr damen is amazingly helpful and by far one of my favorite professors the content of the class was brutal but he has a way of making it tolerable incredibly motivating and his comedy is stress relieving
5643,Mark  Damen,i absolutely love this man his theater background makes his history lectures extremely entertaining and you will have several good laughs he require you buy a textbook which is fantastic and you get points taken away you only add on only downside is he use canvas take this class you will learn so much
5644,Mark  Damen,professor damen has a different way of grading you earn points by doing assignments and taking tests rather than losing them if you get a bad grade this makes it possible to get a good grade even if you do well on tests he has a lot of guidelines for his papers i really enjoyed his lectures if you put forth the effort you can get an a
5645,Mark  Damen,provides textbook for free online a very easy a if you study for the tests and write the essays attendance is not necessary besides test and group work days because all the material and instructions you will ever need are online
5646,Mark  Damen,his lecture are really entertaining and obvious he is passionate however if you do the reading yourself class necessary to go to as long as you review all of the vocabulary words the assessments are extremely easy just study highly recommend his class
5647,Mark  Damen,latin classes here at utah state are amazing professor damen makes you feel like family i imagine my college experience without his intellect and help he truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed if you ever get a chance take his classes they might be difficult but the knowledge you will gain is outstanding
5648,Mark  Damen,super enthusiastic loves the stuff he teaches i would recommend buying the class reader book in the bookstoretake notes on it in class use it to write papers and study the bold terms for minutes before the test and you will get an a in this class
5649,Mark  Damen,i loved him super fun and helpful take any class he teaches really fun to talk to too just an all around amazing professor my favorite one so far and on my third year of college
5650,Mark  Damen,damen was by far my favorite professor this semester he is very enthusiastic about his subject matter and so funny he makes learning history very interesting he put grades on canvas but if you do all writing assignments and pass all tests have an a all test material is bold words on online textbook great teacher great class
5651,Mark  Damen,very enthusiastic teacher he will tell you exactly what he will be covering in each class in the syllabus all test questions come straight from the online text book put bolds the important words you ever need to go to the lectures if you read the text book i never did but got an a the text book is also an audio book
5652,Mark  Damen,great professor does everything possible to allow you to get an a really enthusiastic and loves teaching
5653,Mark  Damen,free online text professor damen is amazing the content my favorite but he is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about history not unreasonable amount of papers he wants everyone to succeed and will help you succeed the tests are a little challenging but studying is the key useful audio and powerpoints great class overall
5654,Mark  Damen,damen is an excellent professor very excited about what he teaches you will have to write several papers but they are short and he is an easy grader he delves into lots of really interesting stuff in his lectures great class i would recommend it to anyone
5655,Mark  Damen,this class is fantastic by far one of my favorites professor damen get really into his lectures it great and he is always very helpful if you study and do the work you will pass no sweat only thing to watch out for are the essays he is very picky about the essays andif you have to reprint it it off automatically so be careful
5656,Mark  Damen,he was definitely one of my favorite professors he was funny and kept your attention all through the class although attendance is not mandatory it is best to be there he covers a lot of info class that makes it easier when reading the book it is a bit of challenge but not too bad
5657,Mark  Damen,he is my favorite teacher by far he is so enthusiastic about everything he teaches this class is a wonderful history class and if you want to learn about religion or crazy roman fights or scandelous stories then take this class from mark p.s i seriously would of had to try to get a bad grade on the tests cause they were that easy
5658,Mark  Damen,very colorful rainbow colorful got rings on at all times three on his left and three on his right an earing and he runs around like a chicken with its head cut off but god is it a great class
5659,Mark  Damen,i think anyone taking one of professor classes will either love him or hate him he is extremely dynamic and passionate about what he teaches as a theater person his lectures are like performances anal about how his class is run the best grading system i have ever had loved his class great teacher not an easy class but not bad
5660,Dr.  Shingle,dr shingle is a very nice woman but not a good teacher in my opinion she is very intelligent so the way she explains the information can be extremely confusing you can ask questions but her answer always clear naturally a strong student so i did well but people who generally strong students struggled in the class
5661,Dr.  Shingle,okay she tells you expected and it smart and can come off as talking down to you online quizzes but two tests are taken in class
5662,Dr.  Shingle,lady is impossible lectures are all over the place she teach the material clearly at all in fact the online quizzes look foreign since you learn nothing in her class actually really annoying if you email her to asked for clarity be prepared for a word answer and no explanation you need to read the book to understand
5663,Dr.  Shingle,okay she rushes through the material kinda quick good at science so i have a tough time but you definitely have to read the chapter in order to do well on the quizzes which are online so are the tests no projects attending class in mandatory you get points a pretty great person
5664,Dr.  Shingle,pretty much an easy a all quizzes are online and test grades are projects
5665,Dr.  Shingle,always go to class the points can bring you down if you miss the quizes can be hard so read your book bother trying to google find many answers she is very helpful so ask for help
5666,Dr.  Shingle,great prof she is funny and interesting she makes the topics crystal clear before this class i was only taking biology because it was required now i love it
5667,Dr.  Shingle,dr.shingle was a great person sometimes her lectures were really boring and a science major but not that bad she tells really good stories and is corny in a funny way she is great to talk to and really smart
5668,Dr.  Shingle,a great teacher she is so down to earth and knows what she is talkin about she makes bio fun
5669,Dr.  Shingle,dr shingle is a great instructor so downtoearth and helpful she was able to bring a topic foreign to most of us in the class to an understandable level also a lot of fun i highly recommend her
5670,Dr.  Shingle,awesome knows how to invlove everyday topics into discussions really into the subject and gets you to feel the same
5671,Dr.  Shingle,no comments
5672,Thomas  Rooney,he tells jokes yes and tells stories not connected with an educational experience and kaboom classtime is over with i believe this is his goal filler to accomplish another class where is the meat where is an education dept at immac
5673,Thomas  Rooney,great guy fun class lots of practical information
5674,Thomas  Rooney,very funny man he offered alot of great tips on teaching i would recommend him
5675,Thomas  Rooney,no comments
5676,Lilli  Downes,this professor was the best instructor as a teacher and intellectual who i have encountered since beginning community college and receiving my m.a degree
5677,Lilli  Downes,i love dr downes very personable easy to understand
5678,Lilli  Downes,no comments
5679,Lilli  Downes,best professor ever she gets you to think on your own instead of just following what everybody else is doing the classes are hard work but it pays off she taught me a lot about myself along with the subject matter i felt like she just an instructor but a friend as well she was very warm and open to her students and would help whenever it was needed
5680,Lilli  Downes,no comments
5681,Lilli  Downes,she helped me understand myself and society i took her for courses and loved every one of them i stand to miss class because her lectures are so interesting i love the way she has students discuss topics and reading assignments
5682,Lilli  Downes,one of the best professors ever had in class challenging rewarding fun
5683,Lilli  Downes,i hated her she tells you at the beginning of the semester that you dont need to take the final if you have an a or a b i dont remember well i had whatever she asked for she made me take the final anyway she gives feminists a bad name jerk
5684,Lilli  Downes,extremely hard my first d a lot of reading and tests are a killer we were expected to know things that we really go in depth about during class time good luck if you take her
5685,Lilli  Downes,i took her social problems class a couple about a year ago awesome class very hard lots and lots of reading stacks of articles handed out each week well worth it one of the best professors at hcc prepares you for the four year schools
5686,Lilli  Downes,great teacher expect to read and discuss a lot relate all aspects of the soc problems on your papers and love you
5687,Lilli  Downes,very hard teacher
5688,Lilli  Downes,an intelligent professor with who will offer help if you ask i was frustrated by her class discussion approach at times but i think it benefited more students overall
5689,Lilli  Downes,feminist teacher impossible tests half the class failed only d that i ever received and i have a gpa
5690,Lilli  Downes,the best professor they have she prepares you for academic success whatever she makes it is not enough
5691,Lilli  Downes,this prof is great she cares about students expects hard work but the hard work is worth it you learn so much
5692,Lilli  Downes,professor really knows the content is fun in class but expects the highest academic standards
5693,Lilli  Downes,gentlemen beware she is out to get you studied my butt off and got a low grade by the way in honours absolutely the hardest class ever taken i gotta admit she was a great teacher
5694,Lilli  Downes,i found her class challenging but very informative you must use college study habits however to pass tests are multiple choice and come from the book not lectures she does enjoy women but likes men as well its humorous just pay attention and show
5695,Lilli  Downes,she is definitely a feminist but an all around nice woman
5696,Robert  Karpinski,dr karpinski is by far one of the best professors at depaul university every time i left his class he helped me look at the world from a completely different perspective he is extremely understanding and is always there to help out simply put every professor should be like him you will miss out if you take this class
5697,Robert  Karpinski,best professor at depaul this professor really cares about his students he gives a couple of essays for the quarter but makes it really easy to pass you redo any assignment until you receive full credit i enjoyed every minute of this class and it was a night class so happy i took him
5698,Robert  Karpinski,i would highly recommend for anyone to take him yes the class is easy and its hard to fail his lectures were very interesting especially for a religion class and he is very understanding
5699,Robert  Karpinski,professor karpinksi is awesome most amazing person i have ever met there are two reflection papers one page each and three papers he does an amazing job at explaining the material he give you extra time to complete the papers take him best religion teacher ever keep up the great work professor chili pepper approved
5700,Robert  Karpinski,professor k is an angel from above he is such an intelligent man he does assign a lot of papers but worth it because you actually learn the readings are interesting and so are his lectures he engages everyone to participate and keeps an open mind during discussions keep up the great work your chili pepper you deserve it
5701,Robert  Karpinski,overall interesting class take if you need to raise your gpa pay attention and turn in your assignments give effort in this class and you should get a a or b
5702,Robert  Karpinski,karpinski is definitely a real gem he gives you extra time to turn in papers he is a fair grader he has amazing lectures he is more interested about you knowing the material than passing so you most definitely will pass if you just show little effort in the class i love this man graduating if not take him again one of the best
5703,Robert  Karpinski,i recommend that you read the course description because the title of the course is misleading the books for the class are necessary every assignment is based on the readings he can come off as a little rude to the skeptics however he really tries hard to be respectful be prepared to hear rambling from the die hard christians in the class
5704,Robert  Karpinski,dr karpinski made it clear during his first interaction with the class that he was there for the students although it was an easy class he made sure that the students got the most out of each and every class through participation great reading material and discussion
5705,Robert  Karpinski,highly recommend taking his class at depaul encourages participation and makes everyone feel included
5706,Robert  Karpinski,dr k was awesome he always kept my interest and made a thursday night class tolerable which is really impressive
5707,Robert  Karpinski,dr k is awesome he is the best teacher had at depaul he genuinely cares about his progress and encourages feedback about his teaching and assignments he was a catholic priest but remains unbiased during class discussions participating is actually enjoyable and encouraged take this class
5708,Robert  Karpinski,best professor he is an incredible individual and my favorite at depaul take him
5709,Robert  Karpinski,dr k is a great professor if you have the opportunity you should take him keeps the class engaged and respects all of his students he teaches you life lessons i think find in any other class at depaul
5710,Robert  Karpinski,highly recommended to anyone dr k is literally one of the coolest professors i have ever run into mainly because he is just a wonderful human being he is so intelligent and so compassionate and he understands the way that education should work i wish i could have him for more classes if you are a smart cookie you will take his class
5711,Robert  Karpinski,great guy understands that college students and knows just a requirement for most of us i was born and raised a catholic and learned more about the religion than i have my whole life mind being in his class on a thursday night
5712,Robert  Karpinski,dr class was awesome i learned a lot about catholicism he is a very down to earth guy that understands students he shares some very interesting stories and real world examples during class
5713,Robert  Karpinski,dr k is undoubtedly one of the best prof at depaul his course was very exciting i learned a lot of things about the catholic religion he explained well his lecture and give us all the info that we need in is awesome not to mention he is a very attractive and good looking man one thing i regret was that i had him for only weeks
5714,Robert  Karpinski,take his you wont regret it if i had any problems it would be he graded the work really late but i ended up with an a i probably learned more about religion in weeks than in religious classes that are year long
5715,Robert  Karpinski,one of the best professors ever i took the class over summer and wished it was a week class he has a great presence about him that makes you want to pay attention and be present for every class as for the workload adequately planned for the length of class time three quizzes response paper and group proj take his class
5716,B  Trentham,best teacher ever so helpful and will work with you after class if you need it
5717,B  Trentham,great teacher take him if you can goes over homework so you should make a on every assignment exams but they too hard if you study he reviews before every test gives you an opportunity for extra credit by turning in a project early
5718,B  Trentham,also took his class a fantastic teacher he makes the class enjoyable goes over the review before every tests and shows you exactly how to do the problems on the test there are tests each is pts multiple choice and pts problems if you listen on review day you should do fine there is a reason his classes always fill up fast
5719,B  Trentham,mr trentham is one of the greatest teachers ever had if you show effort he will help you as much as possible he is very laid back and as long as you try an easy class making sure to sign up for his act class i imagine taking anyone else
5720,B  Trentham,he is super helpful and super nice guy i would refer him to anyone he was an excellent teacher
5721,B  Trentham,mr trentam is one of the funnyest and easiest teachers i think i have ever had he makes class fun and gives you all homework answers he will help you with a test for sure just dont ever leave a blank on a test if you fill it in with just any thing like a smiley face even count it lol awesome
5722,B  Trentham,great teacher there is a reason all his classes fill up very quickly take him you will regret it if you
5723,B  Trentham,still the best take him if you must take accounting i urge you
5724,B  Trentham,i would certainly recomend him he is very laid back and although the class isnt easy he makes it as painless as possible
5725,B  Trentham,mr trentham is the best teacher that i have ever had he really wants his students to succeed and he does everything he can to help you i do not usually rate my professors on this website but i really wanted to give him a good evaluation

5727,B  Trentham,pretty sure hes the coolest teacher at vol state hes so hilarious and makes learning funn hes so goofy and has a good time at his job if you have to take accounting then you should definitely take him
5728,B  Trentham,if you have to take accounting do yourself a favor and take trentham very funny guy good and easy his tests are kinda hard but he tells you exactly whats going to be on it if you put any effort into the class you wont get worse then a b classes consist of going over chapter notes and then giving answers to the homework prac set was required
5729,B  Trentham,great
5730,B  Trentham,brent i would have to say is one of my favorites he explains everything as if you are on the brink of grasping it and his teaching takes you over the edge he is hilarious great guy great class if you have to have it
5731,B  Trentham,super nice guy really explains the matterial well i just wrap my head around it
5732,B  Trentham,brent is a fun teacher i hated the subject but his teaching is great
5733,B  Trentham,makes class fun
5734,B  Trentham,trentham made this class very easy and understandable he has great stories to tell too
5735,B  Hester,excellent teacher she knows what she is talking about and she make anyone feel dumb when they ask stupid questions
5736,B  Hester,no comments
5737,B  Hester,i hate this class with a passion save yourself take it
5738,B  Hester,she seemed to know what she was talking about just not how to explain it with my class she was pretty rude to more than one person and in front of the class one classmate left the class because mrs hester told her there was no reason for homework not to be done and mrs hester proceeded to say does anyone else want to leave class it may just be me though everyone else seems to have a good opinion over her
5739,B  Hester,if you want to learn about accounting then this is the professor to learn from she is fair minded keeps you moving along and makes sure to stop when explanations are not clear ask and she helps great class
5740,B  Hester,mrs hester is an excellent professor she is always willing to help and does a good job shining the light on a difficult subject
5741,B  Hester,video course but was helpful and nice tests were not easy but either is accounting
5742,B  Hester,mrs hester is a superb teacher not only is she knowledgeable in the subject area but she is also able to teach it to others not a talent all accounting teacher possess would highly recommend to anyone who is serious about learning

5749,G  Cutler,awesome teacher really easy going and really tries to help you understand the material i had him for acct and i am taking him again for acct2
5750,G  Cutler,best professor ever a hard course but if you take advantage that he is there to help you will succeed he will answer or clarify any concerns you may have not only i enjoyed this class but i learned a lot huge tip read your texbook if you you will be lost and it will be much harder to understand his lectures
5751,G  Cutler,great guy that understands what it is like to work and go to school he is always available and puts out extra helping instruction just listen and follow close because sometimes he switches gears and may loose you if your not on the ball
5752,G  Cutler,very nice guy take this class you wont regret it.be there for the test review and your good

5758,Raymond  Ercoli,loved him he is a great teacher and is more interested in the design elements and creativity of the projects than construction really wants you to succeed and push your creativeness explain enough how much i loved him and his class
5759,Raymond  Ercoli,ercoli is the best so laid back and free spirited he really gives you the room to be creative instead of always trying to change your ideas like other teachers he has lots of cool books and can tell you about really cool relevant things just ask him def take him for prob solving not clara

5763,Raymond  Ercoli,raymond is the best he is a great person to get to know some of the other teachers may help you to grow as a desginer more but with raymond you truely get a friend
5764,D  Estes,she was hard to understand if you asked a question she wouldnt answer it i almost failed her class because i was so unsure of what to do i learned everything on my own and then in act with hoover i am sure she is a great accountant but not a good teacher at all and not being clear is not teaching at college level its not teaching at all
5765,D  Estes,i enjoyed ms estes she was insightful however if you are immature and want your work hand feed to you then you might not take this class and go back to high school she teaches her class on a college level not high school you act like an adult you are treated like an adult you act like a child you will be treated as a child
5766,D  Estes,i took the online act class with ms estes she was very quick to respond to any questions i had via email and was very fair with grading
5767,D  Estes,if you want to learn how to do accounting take her if you ask her a question she will answer with another question and you end up more confused than what you wereorginally
5768,D  Estes,mrs estes was not a good teacher she was hard to understand and would go on about things that important then she skims over the things that are very difficult not very helpful when struggling with something she teaches the class as though everyone already knows the material she seem to understand that everyone is
5769,D  Estes,no comments
5770,D  Estes,class hard to sit through very boring she answers her own questions and just goes through the problems in the book
5771,D  Estes,overall a good teacher she is pretty boring though although she throws out a joke every now and again her grading is fair and the tests are too bad
5772,D  Estes,very helpful easily understood good grading scale
5773,D  Estes,no comments
5774,Odette  Bruneau,odette was very helpful i learned a lot about myself and my personal teaching styles her assignments are helpful for the future as a student who was not in her advisory she directed me towards better courses which i provided for my actual advisor odette you rock
5775,Odette  Bruneau,odette is one of the most amazing professors ever had i absolutely love her she is so helpful and everything she teaches is stuff that can be applied to the real world she is without a doubt one of my favorite people
5776,Odette  Bruneau,she is my favorite ed prof she is super helpful and a great teacher
5777,Odette  Bruneau,awesome super helpful fun class
5778,Odette  Bruneau,everything she says about teaching is right on i can sometimes hear her pearls of wisdom as teaching
5779,Odette  Bruneau,odette is amazing she has a lot to bring to the field and makes the information fun to learn along with making the information understandable
5780,Odette  Bruneau,super wonderful she has a lot of insight and is always willing to push you even after graduation she pushes you fantastic
5781,Odette  Bruneau,she blew as an adviser
5782,Odette  Bruneau,contrary to popular belief odette does not rock
5783,Odette  Bruneau,very giving of her time and knowledge she tries to bring the best out of each student
5784,Odette  Bruneau,you rock
5785,Odette  Bruneau,you rock odette
5786,Odette  Bruneau,odette my goodness are you hott
5787,Odette  Bruneau,fun good teacher to work with always has good input
5788,Odette  Bruneau,classes are similar but you learn a lot has a lot to bring to the table and very easy to talk to
5789,Dennis  Dipert,his class hard just really easy to get bored as long as you know your terms and definitions be fine he like making things too difficult so the bare minimum is how his classes are set up
5790,Dennis  Dipert,this class is just hard period physics is not my mr dipert can come off as condescending and confusing but found if you approach him outside of class he is a different person he tells you what to expect on quizzes and exams and leaves plenty of room to ask for help if you do well on final and project pass
5791,Dennis  Dipert,never ever have i met a more condescending and rude teacher in my life if you have thick skin you can pretty much expect to leave in tears after every class claims he wants you to succeed but then tells students they make a good such and such if they do do that word cannot describe how awful he talks to students
5792,Dennis  Dipert,this class was way easier than i thought he lays out clear guidelines for what you need to do to pass and you decide how you will do every week he has a quiz which you must be present for to be able to get your points that build up to an a but as long as your getting a decent grade you can leave early he is very willing to help
5793,Dennis  Dipert,great professor really enjoyed his class study your terms in book take the quiz each week and be fine take attendance but must take the quizzes get out early a lot after about the first weeks of class has a good sense of humor definitely recommend his class for anyone know anything when i started and got an a
5794,Dennis  Dipert,very easy class go and take the quiz each week and then you can leave if you want i made over on almost ever quiz you must buy the book for this course then just study the words for every chapter the quizzes are not that difficult and if you stay for the whole class you get out atleast an hour or hour and a half early for night classes
5795,Dennis  Dipert,he is a good professor easy to get along with and he care if you stay for the whole class as long as you take the test at the beginning
5796,Dennis  Dipert,at first i thought he was a little nuts first day of class he told us all he had alzheimers he turned out to be a really cool guy though you have to sit thru class just go in and take your test every class easy a and an interesting class recommended
5797,Dennis  Dipert,no comments
5798,John  Janicek,i loved taking acct and with prof janicek he really does care about his students and wants to see them do well he use hw as a grade nor does he grade it but goes over it in class he took grades for each of the classes midterm final and a case study he does give extra credit to use on the test which is super helpful
5799,Chantal  Maille,avoid i was so excited to take a feminism class she absolutely ruined it for me kept calling cisgender women and brushed me off when i brought it up class discussion felt forced and inorganic readings were excessive and unnecessary mandatory participation is a major drawback since she absolutely care what you have to say
5800,Chantal  Maille,ask a question and spend five minutes giving you a nonanswer definitely got a secondwaver feminism vibe from her
5801,Chantal  Maille,average teacher would not take again fair grader
5802,Chantal  Maille,chantal is very clear about exactly what she wants and is willing to answer any questions easy to get ahold of her and her ta her lectures are pretty much a summarysynthesis of the readings so easy to get away with not doing a deep reading ahead of time there is no textbook she makes the readings available for free
5803,Chantal  Maille,so disappointing i honestly feel like any of the girls in our class could do a better job of teaching this course than her regurgitates the readings during class without interpreting them or trying to engage the students in discussions when she does ask us questions she barely understands our responses most of the time avoid her
5804,Chantal  Maille,seems to have little respect for her students she does not seem to enjoy teaching at all avoid
5805,Chantal  Maille,terrible i was overjoyed to get a b since i could barely stay awake the whole semester class consisted of power points since the professor liked hearing herself talk no class discussion no encouragement strict with attendance and lateness not at all helpful for the final paper keri the class writing tutor is awful too just avoid
5806,Chantal  Maille,great prof brillant thinker very dry sense of humour great readings this class turned out to be a lot more interesting and fun than i originally anticipated
5807,Chantal  Maille,the class has no use at all powerpoints useless when you ask questions she skips over them not answering them she know how to use a computer she figure out how to log on to the computer one class so we do anything every class she repeats herself on what she said in the first class of the semester overall very boring
5808,Chantal  Maille,extremly uptight video useless frustrated when u ask something one small assaigment exam question given one week previously and a final paper
5809,Chantal  Maille,she is intelligent and kind however the constant powerpoints of the readings got dull when she rely on them to lecture it was great she will show you a lot of perspectives and the class is overall incredibly interesting
5810,Chantal  Maille,this class was great the readings were interesting she encouraged class discussion she did not seem closed to activism and encouraged people to speak their minds on a variety of issues from many perspectives she is a bit old school but knows a lot and was pretty engaged in the subject material as this is a class she developed
5811,Chantal  Maille,readings were decent but the prof was terrible disdainful of student activism completely closed to student input gets really defensive and unpleasant if you raise critiques especially closed to poststructuralist and deconstructionist approaches she shows upsetting material depicting graphic violence against women in her classes without warni
5812,Chantal  Maille,if it for the fact that she took attendance i might not have made it considering it should be an intro class in a subject i normally love her lectures are the readings and as for grades she gives you what you probably deserve minus one letter point when discussion happens she lead and it quickly becomes repetitive
5813,Chantal  Maille,boring uninspiring uptight and snappy
5814,Chantal  Maille,all she did in the lectures was summarize the readings if you did the readings the lectures are extremely boring and useless chantal does not encourage class discussions or participation we also watched quite a few movies a nice person but a lazy professor
5815,Chantal  Maille,nice teacher very professional does require lots of reading and class attendance is mandatory fair marker
5816,Chantal  Maille,concordia needs more profesors like dr maille
5817,Chantal  Maille,just never mention the wave she gets mad if you critisize it and takes it very personally also impossible to get an in her class which is bs if you desserve the grade then you should get it she rants sometimes and she sometimes does not take critiques
5818,Chantal  Maille,i agree that she is gentle and kind and she is also professional the work too hard and the lectures class discussion cover the readings in case you do them lots of videos and discussion which is a nice break from taking notes on your knees since the sdbi only has couches not desks
5819,C  Jackson,mr jackson was not helpful at all and was very unnecessarily demanding
5820,C  Jackson,he is a terrible teacher and if you want to pass do not take him he could care less whether you pass or not he is not doing this job because he enjoys to teach thats for sure do not take him
5821,C  Jackson,this guy has no clue what talking about he was out for a week and he came back gave us our test and expected us to know what neither he or the sub went over do no take
5822,J  Allen,very thorough tests go over what we learn in class and she purposefully make them difficult i feel like she cares about us passing and wants us to succeed we have a few take home tests which help to raise our grade gives extra credit and us drop our lowest grade meaning we can skip the final if doing good enough
5823,J  Allen,she is very straight and to the point it is helpful to highlight in the book during lecture most of what she says and puts on the test comes straight from the it highlighting makes it a lot easier to study for her tests use that as your study guide she does not take attendance but her lectures are definetly helpful for the tests
5824,J  Allen,if you make a low test score she will make an appointment to speak with you but will only go over with what you missed she will not offer no extra work work and if you happen to ask again she will say at this point there is nothing she can do like how messed up is that never will recommend her
5825,J  Allen,she tests more on the than the word definitions but she goes over everything and is pretty fair she uses a high school grading system a b etc and that sucks would have gotten an a if she used a regular grading system but overall good teacher who will work with you if you have to miss a test or something
5826,J  Allen,professor allen made it extremely easy to break down medical terms you always know expected on the tests and if you have questions she is always available
5827,J  Allen,mrs allen is not the best teacher ever had she has no personality making it very hard to connect with her and she is very monotone she does give you the terms needed to study for the test but just not terms there are all kinds of required things to learn for the tests like procedures terms different diseases etc
5828,J  Allen,she drops the lowest test grade the final is the same weight as any other test miss a test day she does not allow make ups she has no personality but thats she has so much info to cover if you study even a little you should pass this class tests are straight from the book gives extra credit after the midterm from then on
5829,J  Allen,she is awesome her teaching style is fluid and to the point.this is one class you do not want to take online you will miss out the best professor i have ever had the best word to describe her is wonderful
5830,J  Allen,she is awesome and she tells you what to study for the test no tricks she give extra credit on the last tests and one of the last tests is a take home test i really enjoyed this class i made a a
5831,J  Allen,cool teacher whatever you do take this class online impossible to pass you also have to make a in this class to in order to get an
5832,J  Allen,take this class her lecture the goods she tells you exactly what to study for and what definitions to know she is also very helpful in explaining the bad there really any just know the words she gives you and you will pass
5833,J  Allen,she was pretty cool and told you exactly what was on the tests you ahve to study nonstop though
5834,J  Allen,if you can memorize at least words a week you will do fine in her class if you good luck in passing
5835,J  Allen,she is very helpful and as long as you study everything medical you will do fine
5836,J  Allen,no comments
5837,J  Allen,no comments
5838,M  Blevins,emtb professor at vscc
5839,H  Henson,hunter henson is seriously one of the most intelligent professors ever had and even ever known as a person it took some time to figure this out because he is super super humble he is about yrs but has been teaching ems for yrs he is a truly good person has strong moral compass is an rn in spare time expect breaks
5840,H  Henson,best teacher ever
5841,Casim  Abbas,what a guy abbas is a german genius mathematician with a slick accent always cracking little jokes bringing a little light to a very dull and stale topic the class is stone cold but not gonna change with a different prof plus lectures mandatory because he posts his notes online go to recitation for the quizzes
5842,Casim  Abbas,i love abbas with all my heart having him as a prof is like having a genius grandpa teach you math super approachable cares for students explains ideas offer alternative explanations writes down everything he says and posts online this can be annoying in class but makes it easy to miss class but skip super funny
5843,Casim  Abbas,loved the guy interesting despite the topic and always cracks jokes easy grader and throws a huge curve at the end of the semester
5844,Casim  Abbas,not an easy class but he definitely helps the homework problems are very similar to those on the quizzes and tests
5845,Casim  Abbas,i love this guy really cool
5846,Casim  Abbas,funny guy really smart if naturally good at math this class be too bad i would avoid skipping as he covers about a section a lecture homework is tough but the quizzes and exams are quite easy
5847,Casim  Abbas,sharp guy expects a lot from his studentssometimes i think he confuses us with his grad students he always work out solutions to the homework problems before he assigns them which can turn into long and grueling homework sessions homework took roughly ten hours a week often more however it was definitely worth being in his class
5848,Casim  Abbas,homework due twice a week very hard tests exams and a final were easier than the homework quizzes once a week difficult class but some interesting proofs funny guy
5849,Casim  Abbas,this professor was terrible
5850,Casim  Abbas,the class was hard but not beyond what someone in an honors math class should be able to manage he gave up his own time for a problem session and was helpful with office hours highly recommended
5851,Casim  Abbas,very very difficult even for an honors course not impossible though a good challenge for someone looking to do well in a math career he explains well but the material can be so murky that it is still takes time to sift through gave up his own time to give us an unofficial recitation session i highly recommend him
5852,Casim  Abbas,great teacher commited to helping students understand calculus and do well in the class
5853,Casim  Abbas,excellent communications ability
5854,Casim  Abbas,hes hilarious i liked the lectures
5855,Casim  Abbas,a really good professor and does a lot of examples to help you understand i would definitely recommend him
5856,Casim  Abbas,abbas is
5857,Casim  Abbas,i like him because i understand him when he teaches me in class
5858,Casim  Abbas,abbas is hilarious
5859,Casim  Abbas,not a great prof but a damn genius and really funny
5860,Ronald  Coleman,i wouldnt take a class by him again unless it was free he just wasnt a good teacher acted bothered if you tried to contact him i did take the class online so maybe it was that but the class wasnt too hard just a lot of memorizing medical terms
5861,Ronald  Coleman,taking online class good teacher nice and helpful organized and clear study the vocabulary and golden
5862,Ronald  Coleman,i took this class on line this summer dr coleman was extreemly helpful and quick with getting back to me with any questions i struggled a bit at the beginning but he kept with me and was encouraging through the course i wound up getting an a i would highly recommend him
5863,Ronald  Coleman,i took prof web class we had multiple choice tests over terms a homework case study test and a final case study one was a bit difficult if you do what is expected of you this can be a very easy class there is a list of terms that is given at the beginning of the semester memorize these and make an a
5864,Ronald  Coleman,i took the class ahc med term college home course test are super easy only all together are multiple choice and is mc just study and make note cards i had no medical background what so ever and passed with a extra credit is offered
5865,Ronald  Coleman,all tho i didnt get him for a lecture class he is a great support for the college at home course willing to help and very understanding he is a wise man with compassion to seeing you succeed
5866,Ronald  Coleman,he is great i have him for medical terminology and i absolutely love his class and his ways of grading our tests if i could i would take him again
5867,Ronald  Coleman,his class was majorly easy he gives notes for each chapter section and test reviews however his lab makes you sweat a bit but when fun great
5868,Ronald  Coleman,he is gneiss as schist we love you mr coleman you know who this is from
5869,Ronald  Coleman,i loved mr coleman his class is hard but his grading is very fair i disagree with the previous comment he does teach on a students level just a college level not a grade one
5870,Ronald  Coleman,mr coleman has a wonderful personality and if i were a paleontologist listining to his sermons i would probably understand his class he teach on a level he should be teaching a harvard level geology course
5871,J  Harrison,i took her online her test are really hard way harder than they should be she isnt very helpful at all when you ask her questions her response is usually one sentence long basically if i could go back definitely take someone else i usually do these but i look at them and wanted to help others out make her your last choice
5872,P  Bode,one of the most accessible instructors i have come across in three years jolly on the spot with any assistance you need her passion lights up yours gotta earn the grade but you will know the material inside and out fab teacher
5873,P  Bode,ms bode is passionate about what she teaches she is a great instructor her classes are not for those who want an easy a you may get an a but it will not be easy if you work at it you will get an a and you will learn the subject material if you want to work take these classes
5874,P  Bode,had her for several classes including online classes goes above and beyond the standards to help and to answer questions always interested in student progress even after graduation knows what she is doing has passion for the subjects she teaches encouraging personality one of the best
5875,Susan  Mulcahy,ms mulcahy is a very good teacher she is willing to help and is very clear in what she expects from each assignment since this is a course you will be doing many different projects throughout the semester so it is in your best interest that you go to class
5876,Susan  Mulcahy,mrs mulcahy was so easy but the best part is i still learned in this class just do the assigments how she wants have the book and the notes for the online tests come to class and you will have no trouble making an a attendance is huge and just try to understand what asking for on assignments turn in early work great
5877,Susan  Mulcahy,not even sure if easy is the word for her class as long as you turn in every assignment and look at the during the online tests you are basically gaurenteed an a also make sure to attend as much as possible that is part of your participation grade i did everything the day it was due in her class so not joking
5878,Susan  Mulcahy,not as hard if you study her notes and take notes on any keywords and points she makes during lectures just pay attention i got extra points on all of my papers and projects and most of them were done last minute however so hard on attendance that missing classes last semester dropped my grade a full letter which was very frustrating
5879,Susan  Mulcahy,her class was extremely boring and i am an art major the class was easy but there was a lot of assignments as long as you do all the assignments on time and always show up to class you will pass i never talked in there because she will make you feel stupid i know a lot about art but she would make me feel so dumb for sharing
5880,Susan  Mulcahy,super easy class she gives extra points for attending class there is a lot of work but it is very easy as long as you show up to class and listen to how to do it i would recommend her for sure
5881,Susan  Mulcahy,i took her printmaking class it was very fun it is not like a highschool art class where you just make art and it is cool you must try to make good composition she cares more about that than subject matter if you can understand the way she thinks then you can figure out what she wants and do it she is a great teacher and knows her stuff
5882,Susan  Mulcahy,i really did not care for art until i took her class she is very clear in her class checklist and made me like art
5883,Susan  Mulcahy,art is drawing i learned a lot in this class but not a class you can joke about she is very serious with work because it is a studio class students have to be hardworking and show improvement for her to be happy which is sensible i do recommend her as a drawing teacher
5884,Susan  Mulcahy,the worst art class i have ever taken and this is harsh since i am an art major and love to write constantly unclear and became frustrated when you understand i asked for extra credit because she wanted to use presentation of mine for future use and she accused me of being manipulative she grades essays hard despite her terrible grammar
5885,Susan  Mulcahy,why why why are all the teachers in the art department insisted on making an easy intro to art class so freaking difficult you miss a day or you lose off your final grade you have to buy the expensive book have to write papers do quizzes and take test are you kidding me
5886,Susan  Mulcahy,very boring she is elderly and soft spoken test are relatively hard however my suggestion is to take her as a hybrid class you only have to meet times and everything else is online also study the slides over and over on every test the time limit is really short
5887,Susan  Mulcahy,very nice and extremely helpful but the most boring class ever taken tests and essays are pretty easy just so sick of the pics ready for class to be over
5888,Susan  Mulcahy,she is way too harsh when grading her essays i never made below a in my english class but i got on my essays in her class she thinks an english teacher apparently i had to dumb down my essays to get an a she did however let me rewrite my essay so she heartless
5889,Susan  Mulcahy,terrible class everyone i knew made a c or lower by far the most boring clas you will ever go to i love art but after this class i rethought my art major
5890,Susan  Mulcahy,she is not a bad teacher is always willing to help if you need it just an extremley boring class and is relativley hard
5891,Susan  Mulcahy,teaches a great foundation is art concepts and technique takes great care that all the students understand ideas they may be unfamiliar with
5892,Susan  Mulcahy,you actually learn somethingeven if not interested in art
5893,C  Hampton,rude when asked questions in class she says look it up read your book when you ask about due dates in class she tells you look online bring your syllabus to class her lectures are crazy disorganized good luck taking notes tests are insanely hard taking notes and reading the book help papers are easy once i liked art
5894,C  Hampton,top worst teachers had at vol state she is rude and reads from power points every class all class accused me of plagerizing an opinionated paper like i was not capable of producing a material would not take awful teacher
5895,C  Hampton,this teacher will kill your gpa if you looking for an art class just because your major calls for one look further this is no ordinary art class as the criteria may state she sucks at everyway she teaches talks all class more like a history class i swear you could take the powerpoints from lecture and still fail her test
5896,C  Hampton,very boring class she seems like she really come off clear a lot of times
5897,C  Hampton,i took this class online it bad at all you get extra credit opportunities it is very clear what she expects of you if you follow simple directions it will be reflected in your grade
5898,C  Hampton,i took her online class wow she expected more writing than my english comp class did graded fairly easily on discussion posts but her tests were pretty hard i finished up with a b
5899,C  Hampton,i liked her as long as you study take lotss of notes and keep up with the dates you will do great in her class she emails back fast too
5900,C  Hampton,i am taking her online class and she is very rude and does not explain anything.it seems like to me she hates her job and wants to take it out on her students i do not recommend her at all
5901,C  Hampton,i took her for art history and studio first she is inexplicably angry at our generation unjustly offended by technology constantly accusing the class of not caring convinced that her work in unappreciated in studio she will always have something negative to say hardly anything positive expects the world out of her students
5902,C  Hampton,i took ms hamptons hybrid art class the class was very tough challenging however i came to college to learn even if it was a subject out of my comfort zone i learned to appreciate art as i never did before her class ms hampton is abrupt and to the point however i loved her be prepared to work hard your grade come for free
5903,C  Hampton,i took her art appreciation class during my first semester of college before the class i was a notorious critic of matisse i had never liked his work but after reading the book and hearing her lectures i finally admire his work take her class with an open mind and you will do just fine
5904,C  Hampton,i took this class as a week summer session.i was a lot of not hard you just have to put your best foot forward and try you will do fine the biggest problem i had in the class was the rudeness of other students towards her this class is not meant for an easy is college do not expect her to just had you an a and you will be fine
5905,C  Hampton,she was very rude and demeaning to all of my work that i submitted she really teach very well do not take
5906,C  Hampton,i really liked her i had her last semester and i made a a in her class you have a quiz about every weeks over art work and the dates and the artists which is a easy a you write papers in her class the tests are easy just let her know that you want to do well in the class and at least try and you will make a a
5907,C  Hampton,i enjoyed her hybrid class very much i think she made the discussions clear and easy to post she enjoys humor so apply what you are learning to something real life with a smile on it and you will get high marks participation a
5908,C  Hampton,regardless of personality flaws and teaching styles hampton is still a human being she deserves respect and appreciation for what she does and the passion she possesses if you show you are making an effort to learn her material all that matters she expect you to love art but to appreciate it that is key to passing her course
5909,C  Hampton,i understand why teachers have to make a subject like art so boring and hard and for the love of mary why make students buy a book you even use half the time
5910,C  Hampton,nice lady but takes art to an extreme do not take her if not a master in writing papers she acts more like an english teacher than an art teacher at times test are easy if you study and go to class rarely used the book you will learn a lot from her but needs to understand that she is not an english teacher
5911,C  Hampton,this woman is extremely rude and hateful the first day i ever attended school at vol state i was lost and sent to her to ask her where i should go for my art class i knocked on her door and she proceeded to rip the door open and tell me off in front of her class for interupting her lecture i was mortified she ruined my first day of college
5912,C  Hampton,she is annoying
5913,Anthony  Roda,alright let me justify my rating true a nice guy but where the benefits end sure he gives you test questions but often change them or put new questions you never studied and if you word it correctly wrong lectures are pointless if beyond the first row the books are not easy reading stay away
5914,Anthony  Roda,this class is horrible i am in i right now he does not teach he expects you to read these complicated ethic books and teach yourself and make your own study guides so if you understand it you will fail the tests like half this class hard he is useless as a teacher and clear with what you should study
5915,Anthony  Roda,avoid he may be very intelligent but only someone with bionic ears would be able to hear him speak yes helpful he gives test questions ahead of time because it would be impossible to pass otherwise take philosophy with another professor
5916,Anthony  Roda,roda can be hard to understand since he talks really low so you might want a seat in the first rows he is a harsh grader but he looks like he have a curve on most quizess and test everything is based on the reading which can be hard to understand themselves somethimes he will go overthings that wont be on the test overall its a hard class
5917,Anthony  Roda,hated this class although he may be a old he is nearly impossible to understand is the most unfair grader i have ever encountered does not care how much effort you put in studying wise there is no chance of extra credit his advice better on the next i would never take a class with him again if you paid me
5918,Anthony  Roda,took ethics with him basically yoda i would kill anyone for roda awesome
5919,Anthony  Roda,donttake his is about7080yrs old prob half a a tube through his wont be able to hear past the books were very hard to me at leastethics by frankena was the cant tell you enough dont take his warning you nowhe should be i am an ab studentnever d
5920,Anthony  Roda,tests are hard but he gives review sheets with exact questions on them he is hard to understand but if you do the reading and ask questions the class hard he will help anyone who wants it
5921,Anthony  Roda,cleaar your filthy ears out and listen to this man he knows what he is talking about and gives all he has left to do it best philosophy doctor in my days
5922,Anthony  Roda,prof roda is a horrible teacher ethics and philosophy are great because they are subjects that allow a lot of personal interpretation unfortunately this old man who can barely talk is a very closed minded individual though he tries to help you prepare with quizes and tests he makes it virtually impossible to have the level of patience needed to do well in the class im sure he was an outstanding teacher years ago
5923,Anthony  Roda,love this guy you need to grow up and pay attention ask questions clearly and get a clear response brilliant but you should try to get in the first row to hear better
5924,Anthony  Roda,beware the tracheotomy
5925,Anthony  Roda,dr roda is not at all the way most of these reviews make him sound i know how much easier he could make it seeing as he gives you all the test and quiz questions ahead of time he also offeres to help with any questions you have in my experience he was a very nice enjoyable teacher
5926,Anthony  Roda,no comments
5927,Anthony  Roda,the worst teacher ever he speaks softer than a mouse and is extremely rude and cranky do not i repeat do not choose this teacher don not
5928,Anthony  Roda,hes not as bad as all these ppl make him sound
5929,Anthony  Roda,wow i do not recomend this class with this professor i speant half my time trying to figure out what hes saying and the other half screaming at him no words can explain this class
5930,Anthony  Roda,nearly blind and deaf talks too quietly to be heard beyond the second row sometimes even the first regularly minutes late to class tries to make up for it at the end doesnt explain things well no comments on tests unfair grading worst prof ever
5931,Anthony  Roda,very nice man but horrible teacher comes late look over work and is completely deaf you have to repeat yourself a billion times and then he still hear you and tells you to speak up imagine how much fun taking attendence was
5932,Anthony  Roda,very smart man who knows his material he is a little hard to understand and hear well whether or not you enjoy his class depends on how much you put into it he knows an extrodinary amount and would love to impart it to you you can do well though
5933,McVey,this class was hard for me but i been in school or used most of the material covered in real life in years she was very helpful was always able to explain how to do the problems when i got stuck there is a bunch of homework tests weigh for of your grade as long as you do the homework you have any problems with tests
5934,McVey,mrs mcvey is very smart but has no idea how to explain her knowledge she does not allow you to use a calculator the whole first half of the class her tests are extremely hard and consist of most of your grade the homework will take you hours and hours a week which count for much she is a nice person but i would not take her class
5935,McVey,do not take math with this teacher she is very rude talks to you like your stupid if you have any questions never responds to emails and really doesnt care if you pass or fail
5936,McVey,she is horrible never answer email and horrible at explaining not a good teacher to take
5937,McVey,powers through lectures horrible at explaining how or why things work very picky about how she wants answers written and usually tell you ahead of time how she wants it written a bit critical basically reads the book off and lets class fend for itself
5938,McVey,love mrs mcvey took her for math classes she was amazing and caring and helpful a really great teacher
5939,McVey,mrs mcvey is an excellent instructor she does keep it moving to stay on schedule but she explains everything step by step she leave anything out she is very willing to help you and informs you of all of your resources she wants you to do good and has a good sense of humor will answer any questions enjoyed her class
5940,McVey,does not slow down for anything hard core on grading if you have a comma in the correct spot the entire problem is wrong does not answer questions very explain things well expects you to know everything and she is just reviewing you on the material not good
5941,McVey,i know how she has received any good scores as teacher she is horrible flies through the material and really explain it when you ask her to slow down or explain she tries but it makes no sense her grading is insane and she is not forgiving on small mistakes
5942,McVey,i had this teacher for college algebra she is very picky about her grading she will count the problem incorrect if you put and other nit pick things overall i recommend her she is helpful but seemed to go about things the long way
5943,McVey,
5944,McVey,she is a really good teacher but her tests and grading aspects are ridiculous i got a yc in her class because i failed all of the tests but i got on all the homework other than that she is a good teacher but i perfer not to take her again
5945,McVey,i had to take this class because i get a good act score so i already knew what i was doing she is one of the best math teachers i have ever had she really knows how to break everything down so you can understand although you can not use calculators she makes everything easy enough to be able to do without one
5946,McVey,mrs mcvey is one of the best math teachers ever known math can be difficult for lots of people but i watched mrs mcvey help even the dumbest person understand what they were doing she is very detailed and picky but it is beneficial to the student she is very fair and respectful of everyone period
5947,McVey,this is an incredible teacher however you must be ready to work with no book that is very unconventional for us older students but you will make it she will go above and beyond her calling to make sure you get the lessons you just have to ask her if you are really struggling she will help you outside of class i highly recommend her
5948,McVey,as a person she is wonderful and kind i have taken the week class since it went too fast i was there everyday and did my best but transfered out of her class and into a full semester of elm alg i now have an a i like the fact if you finish checking your work because you see it in your head mark you wrong
5949,McVey,this teacher is extremely helpful she move on to the next lesson until everone understands the course is weeks long and moves pretty quick attendence is key to everyday class the previous comments by people who like her more than likely go to class regularly and they fell behind she knows her stuff
5950,McVey,this is the most horrible teacher i have ever had she wont allow you to make up tests she makes your final counts double or triple.even though i had a doctors note and a field trip for another class recently she has been behind and has taught around lessons in class periods.at this point only around people are passing her class
5951,McVey,she is wonderful
5952,McVey,i do not like her i feel that she care about your grade and she will not help you unless you schedule for help on her time i would not recommend this teacher
5953,J  Harville,super easy class if you like math he will help you any way you can i took him for and now
5954,J  Harville,mr harville is wonderful i took his math online and have a avg so far the class work is easy no complaints
5955,J  Harville,i took his online class during the summer he was very lenient if i could not get past a section by his due date he would give me some extra time also he would give me options to get help section i think was the hardest but just pass that and it gets easier make sure you do the notebook he does collect those
5956,J  Harville,his online class was hard
5957,J  Harville,mr.harville is an excellent instructor that will do anything that he can to help i say that is class is easy but if you make a good effort you can make an a in his course if you take this course make sure that you complete all homework assignments and review test they are important because they are similar to the test
5958,J  Harville,hes a nice guy willing to do whatever it takes for you to learn the material i took it in the summer and it easy by no means i spent alot of extra time in the math lab so i could understand it i would have loved to take him in a longer semester and yeah not too bad looking for an older man
5959,J  Harville,he is a pretty good teacher take him in the summer because it is really easy he gives you a study guide with everything on that will be on the test you do have to teach yourself most of the time but the book is really good at explainging problems well and he does a lot of examples in class take him in the summer it goes by fast
5960,H  Lawson,had a b average in there until the final and made a c he is not very clear and will interrupt himself while working out a problem to go on a tangent not recommended
5961,H  Lawson,i took lawson for college algebra and i must say that at times his teaching methods can be confusing hes a little irritated by somethings but only if class gets out of hand a bit he recommends to only use the website and not the book i learned more in the math lab
5962,H  Lawson,mr lawson is a remarkably helpful and interested professor he is not easy but he is very fair he really wants you to do well although i know some people think him confusing i took him after barely making it through highschool math classes and he is the first teacher i have understood he has a bit of a temper so smart mouth him
5963,H  Lawson,mr lawson is a good teacher sometimes he allows himself to get distracted and he does lecture on his personal beliefs occasionally but usually very helpful i had a very easy time with his class but admittedly i already knew the material and was simply getting an easy math credit still i would reluctantly recommend him
5964,H  Lawson,i graded for mr lawson and the way that he grades homework does not help the students he simply wanted me to check that it was done not whether it was right or wrong staff in the advising center told me not to take him when i asked them which teacher i should take students have told me that he is very hard to understand and not helpful
5965,H  Lawson,cares about the students i highly recommend him
5966,H  Lawson,i had never gotten higher than a c in highschool i got a in his class
5967,H  Lawson,terrible teacher as a person he is pretty nice but hes teaching style is so confuseing and tests are really hard would not reccomend him
5968,H  Lawson,i couldnt tell if he was lecturing math or about the soccer club
5969,H  Lawson,flake is right i used to play long can we distract lawson in every class which was easy anyways but we got up to an hour before he noticed if you want to work you butt off take this guy
5970,H  Lawson,i showed up for every class took notes paid attention and still follow this guy what a flake
5971,H  Lawson,i loved this class as long as you miss alot do your homework no way that you have at least a b in this class i rarely studied got an a he makes class fun to sit through by telling stories or jokes everyone needs to take him for college level algebra
5972,H  Lawson,no comments
5973,H  Lawson,i learned so much from professor lawson he really explains things well i always felt uplifted because of his positive attitude towards life i will consider him one of my favorite all time teachers
5974,C  Conrad,he is a very kind man and is willing to set aside fridays for study groups if you are available his teaching is mediocre and students correct his problems at least times a day so watch out for his work his tests are mediumchallenging and must do homework to understand them the exam is extremely difficult so better do good on those tests
5975,C  Conrad,terrible teacher cannot get a full thought out will tell you incorrect information and even if you are correct will tell you that he is correct does not understand electronics and makes you do the class on the computer without any clue as to how to do it makes you buy a book for and let you use it
5976,C  Conrad,he was horrible the first week he confused everyone and sometimes just seem to know what he is talking about he tells stories that have nothing to do with class he is the worse do not take his class
5977,C  Conrad,professor conrad is a very fair grader and certainly wants his students to understand the material he had multiple study sessions outside of class there is a lot of out of class work that he assigns however it really helps you understand each and every topic
5978,C  Conrad,awful i had him as a professor for college algebra while i was still in high school whenever anyone asked him a question he hardly ever answered the question being asked when he would try to show someone how to work out a problem he would get it wrong i basically had to teach myself
5979,C  Conrad,i have always been a good math student so good it is my major however conrad is a terrible teacher he is hard to follow and is corrected by his students at least once a day might as well take it online because you will be teaching yourself i will probably retake because his test are of your grade and his grading makes no sense
5980,C  Conrad,he teaches directly from the book and is very boring makes many mistakes on the board and has to be corrected by students tests of grade and homework of grade very difficult if you are not naturally good at math
5981,C  Conrad,class is very difficult because calculus he do a great job at explaining the material during class but if go to his office and ask for help explain it much better you have to show up to his class if you know calculus by heart let him intimidate you during the first couple of weeks either he is a nice man
5982,C  Conrad,do not take this class if you have never taken calculus or trig overall had a horrible experience in this course i not learn anything from him i had too go home and learn the material by myself many of the problems on his tests are different from the homework he assigned he is very sarcastic and expects you to already know e
5983,C  Conrad,to be honest he is a smart person at math can he teach no it is kind of like einstein teaching a little boy about his own theories only uses the examples not his own you would have to have additional help in order to pass his class the text book wast horrible at explaining things
5984,C  Conrad,this guy seriously needs to retire get ready to teach yourself or fail the class he explain anything he expects you to already know how all homework and quizzes are in mathlabs the tests are proctored and count percent of your grade do not take
5985,C  Conrad,he is an excellent teacher for math majors i highly recommend taking a different teacher if you are not a math major he teaches fundamentals of math not formulas if you are not a math major pay attention and show up to study groups
5986,C  Conrad,conrad is not as bad as the reviews took a night class and he was always concerned with the students understanding the material before continuing to the next assignment we used mathlabs for all the hw and quizzes so a lot of self learning and studying but conrad did teach well in my opinion funny guy too would take again
5987,C  Conrad,not an excellent teacher do a very good job of explaining the material required homework and quizzes are all online his due dates change at random things will be due when they even been discussed in class nice man but i recommend him
5988,C  Conrad,can not teach
5989,C  Conrad,my misery my nightmare
5990,C  Conrad,worst teacher would come in late still eating lunch take smoke breaks or go get more lunch no in class work or help all on time took this class again and made an a with other professor
5991,C  Conrad,mr conrad was a funny guy but his teaching method is a lot different then what use to if your someone who understands math easy probably enjoy his class otherwise recommend taking another teacher
5992,C  Conrad,mr conrad is a great teacher i am terrible at math and had to take developmental courses all of which i took with conrad he helped me figure it out and as long as you go to class and do the work he gives you the benefit of the doubt a great instructor in college algebra now and when i ask questions he always helps willingly
5993,C  Conrad,makes you feel stupid he expects you to already know all the material and does not teach you anything you couldnt read off a powerpoint no book work all online and test are percent of the grade
5994,Kathy  Johnson,great teacher if you pay attention and come to class you will do fine very understanding and always there to help she will reward those who try and comes to class would defiantly take again
5995,Kathy  Johnson,mrs johnson is an all around decent professor i am not good at math whatsoever so i have trouble in her class however she is understanding do not miss her class if you have to trust me you will regret it she is pretty good at explaining things and will help you further i have anything bad to say about her
5996,Kathy  Johnson,in her probability and statistics class she does not explain things well at all she did not show us how to use statcrunch bc we use it on tests it was made for online hw so online hw takes hours she does not drop lowest grade or provide extra credit so if you understand her complex teaching you are screwed
5997,Kathy  Johnson,mrs johnson is a wonderful teacher one of the best i have ever had she genuinely cares about the success of her students and wants them to do good she is more than willing to help when a student needs extra help she tries to teach each lesson several different ways because everyone learns differently highly recommend this teacher
5998,Kathy  Johnson,mrs johnson is one of the most compassionate teachers i have ever had she takes the time to make sure that you understand the material and she is extremely understanding of the situation of her students ive never had a teacher take so much interest in my academic welfare when you need help she is always there i really lucked out
5999,Kathy  Johnson,the class itself was hard at first then it got easier did not have a good experience with the teacher she was very rude and not encouraging either when time came for students to drop the class she said if anybody wants to drop let me know so i can get forms ready she should be encouraging us to continue and help not drop it
6000,Kathy  Johnson,maybe she is different on campus than online i took online she did not seem to care or be helpful at all so far she is the teacher i am most dissatisfied with i had a great gpa and made mostly before making my first c in her classes she seem to have any care that some people work full time
6001,Kathy  Johnson,great teacher she cares about your grades and always makes sure you understand the material
6002,Kathy  Johnson,this is one of the most helpful math teachers that i have ever had for a class she goes out of her way to help you out and usually responds very quickly to emailed questions even over the weekend if math is intimidating this is the right teacher to help you learn and understand it
6003,Kathy  Johnson,take her class she actually cares about her students and wants to help them as much as possible
6004,Kathy  Johnson,she will go out of her way to help you with any problem that you may have she uses her own mnemonic devices to help you understand better the mechanics of math teacher take her
6005,Kathy  Johnson,she is an awesome teacher there is nothing bad to say about mrs johnson if you speak up and say you need help she will go above and beyond to help she truly cares and wants her students to succeed she is an exceptional teacher and person take her if at all possible
6006,Kathy  Johnson,amazing teacher had her for my online college alg class and she is so helpful with any questions you have i would take one of her classes anytime
6007,Kathy  Johnson,she is not easily frustrated when students ask questions but she usually explains things really well homework is due on test days tests are not very hard she tries to make the lessons fun and interesting she also gives advice on how to teach lessons in the classroom i wish i had taken her for she really wants to see her students succeed
6008,Kathy  Johnson,she is a great teacher she will help you just as long as you ask her i hated math but she made the class interesting she makes her tests sound hard but they are easy promise you have homework with no definite deadline and a fun tessalation basically easy grades i highly recommend her
6009,Kathy  Johnson,had a bad experience with this class because she decided at the last minute to make it an online class which i like but when i voiced how i felt about it she was quick to tell me she would not let me fail she even held optional study meetings and was extremely helpful math is not my she helped alot wld take her again
6010,Kathy  Johnson,i think mt johnson is an awesome teacher and is one of the few that really care if you get it or not if you understand speak up and she will help you anyway she can to make sure you understand i say enough good things about her i hate algebra and she helps you get it even when it is hard for you.i got a b and i suck in this area
6011,Kathy  Johnson,mrs johnson can get carried away at times and leave the students confused but if you ask questions she will clarify things for you she tries to read expressions but no one is a mind reader if you take her and understand speak up there were tests and a final the lowest grade is dropped
6012,Kathy  Johnson,i just love her she is so helpful understanding i hate math and she tries so hard to make sure you understand everything she takes her time and puts math on a level that you understand i cant say enough great things about her take her class
6013,Kathy  Johnson,not sure but i do think that shelly tests are easier i took this class at the same time that a friend of mine was taking and her tests seemed easier ms johnson is awesome though i took this hybrid if you ever have a problem and your work is going to be late just tell her homework due every couple of days
6014,Rita  Sowell,if you at least attempt all of the homework do fine in dr class the start of each class will be spent going over homework and this is where most of the learning takes place imo as a teacher she was fair respectful and very accessible to all of us my only complaint is that we ran out of time near the end and had to rush
6015,Rita  Sowell,dr sowell is great and she knows what shes doing but i feel she could work on her teaching skills she moves very fast and sometimes dosent show every step of the problem for someone who is a bio major and not math inclined this can prove hard she has really strengthed my math skills though take her shes great youll just have to work hard
6016,Rita  Sowell,i really enjoyed dr class she is there to help her students and cares about how you do in the class you have homework every night and tests are weighted heavy but if you do the homework you should to good on tests i would recommend her
6017,Rita  Sowell,at first she seemed very enthusiastic about teaching the class after a while she seemed to get confused and second guessed herself and very helpful a lot of the time outside of class she was pretty responsive other than going over homework questions and being redundant with lectures i felt as if no one was really learning anything
6018,Rita  Sowell,she is a really nice person but her lectures are hard to follow she kinda is all over the place she takes forever to answer emails and is hardly ever physically in her office however she gives lots of partial credit on test which saved me if you dont do the homework or study you wont pass
6019,Rita  Sowell,she is a nice enough individual but absolutely no help for the subject the only teaching that she does is hand out print outs of how to use stat crunch and most of the time what she gives you is unclear and the examples are not helpful at all i would only recommend taking this class if you want to teach yourself how to do statistics
6020,Rita  Sowell,had her for an online course never had a professor who was less helpful i emailed several times for clarification on specific types of problems and she told me spend more time studying when i was already spending more time on this class than my other combined would not recommend her for an online class
6021,Rita  Sowell,dr sowell is awesome took her for elemantary statistics and dreaded it from day one she made it as easy as possible and explained everything very well tests were not too bad but the hw is online which i hated she genuinly cares wether you learn or not and will do anything to help you as long as you put in the effort i definately reccomend
6022,Rita  Sowell,one of the best teachers had enrolled in her class for differential equations and cal ii
6023,Rita  Sowell,i took her for an online class she is a great teacher always helpful the book work gets alittle hard but its not her making it up
6024,Rita  Sowell,excellent teacher in online courses as long as you asked questions she would help you out i made an a after being out of math for years i strongly recommend her if math is not a good subject for you
6025,Rita  Sowell,didnt respond to emails quickly at all i had to go out of town for a family emergency and asked to take a proctered test from my laptop but she said no so i failed the midterm for reasons out of my control i still passed her class but she was not very helpfull or sympathetic towards my situation at all not a good online teacher to take
6026,Rita  Sowell,great teacher i had her for college algebra online and came out with an a after being absent from math for years she was very helpful to me and i hope i have her again as a prof in the future
6027,Rita  Sowell,dr rita sowell is the best teacher ever had i took calc ii and diff eq from her and absolutely loved it which is saying a lot about her while she expects you to work hard she does everything in her power to help you and sincerely cares about her students almost sorry for this semester to be over just cause i have her again
6028,Rita  Sowell,great professor made it easy to comprehend in class and made great use of electronic notes
6029,Rita  Sowell,this was a online class you do all your work tests at you ever needed help ms sowell would work problems for you or offer to meet you online she seems real nice and i would take her class
6030,Rita  Sowell,online class work was consistent but not over bearing i am taking her now for college algebra good teacher and most of the times understanding about late work and having it extended to complete it
6031,Rita  Sowell,professor is very nice and is willing to help but i done decent in the class grades great but certainly not the worst i failed the final so she failed me for the entire semester i have to take it again there is nothing fair about this
6032,Rita  Sowell,a mistake
6033,Rita  Sowell,online class was really hard went too fast would not put lectures up until the day the assignment was due
6034,Bruce  Arrigo,this dude is a boss while there is a lot of writing it really that bad and there is no test got a b in the class and even use the book i only used it for the writing assignments which are weekly
6035,Bruce  Arrigo,very openminded and articulate be there for you when you need it
6036,Bruce  Arrigo,very intelligent in the subject but requires too much irrelevant work no tests is an upside but all the papers make up for it
6037,Bruce  Arrigo,page paper due every week and one pg paper due at the end which is going to suck and a group project on a chapter in the book nice guy very very intelligent and knows this subject up and down just follow the syllabus on the papers and you should be fine i would recommend
6038,Bruce  Arrigo,great professor page papers due each week and one final page paper no final exam attendance not mandatory
6039,Bruce  Arrigo,not a bad professor interesting you have a page paper due each week not bad i usually read the chapter the night before you have a page paper due at the end but i basically put all my paper together and it worked out perfectly oh yeah you have a group presentation but basically one chapter out the book attendance is not mandatory
6040,Bruce  Arrigo,a lot of work but the papers take less than like an hour to write the only hassle the whole year is the ridiculous page paper no paper needs to be that long to get a point across you dont really have to even to go to class except for the presentation day and to turn in your papers easy class if you do the work
6041,Bruce  Arrigo,great are pg chapter page paper a group project and frequent class discussions.but if you take into account you have one paper due per week and the rest of the time just very interesting discussion with no tests to cram for.you really learn the information and it will be with you for life.take him
6042,Bruce  Arrigo,listen to the slackers if you enjoy cj and actually want to learn something novel and challenging and different take his classes he can be challenging but he helps you and attack you like other professors his classes usually mean a lot of reading and discussion but well worth it also his graduate classes are rocking
6043,Bruce  Arrigo,bruce arrigo really motivates you to think outside your box which is nice
6044,Bruce  Arrigo,simply put dr arrigo is the man common sense in a sea of lunacy intelligence in a world of stupidity and someone not afraid to think outside the box instead of grazing with the sheep every graduate class should be like his read or lecture grad students get them to think for themselves dr arrigo gets it
6045,Bruce  Arrigo,this guy is full of himself bother doing the reading because it help
6046,Bruce  Arrigo,this was a phenomenal honors capstone course clear and challenging thought provoking and enjoyable
6047,Bruce  Arrigo,i had dr arrigo a number of years ago as a graduate student and his classes were nothing like what these freshmen are describing attendance was mandatory class discussions were stimulating and papers were challenging he was one of the best teachers i ever had
6048,Bruce  Arrigo,no need to go to class tests are take home they are tricky though so take your time my major is criminal justice and learned nothing haha
6049,Bruce  Arrigo,just like the other guy said take home tests straight out of the book in order no need to attend class interesting topics discussed in class sometimes
6050,Bruce  Arrigo,he take attendence the tests are take home tests no point in even going to class but questions on tests are kind of tricky easy a if you really look hard for the answers on the tests
6051,Bruce  Arrigo,dont bother showing up to class his tests are take home and open book his lectures are indepth and boring i only went on test days to get my test and got an a
6052,Bruce  Arrigo,no comments
6053,Bruce  Arrigo,awesome class excellent professor i learned more and enjoyed this class more than any other in the criminal justice department if you have any interest in criminal law whatsoever love it
6054,W  Hagewood,i hate math this gentleman taught his class in such a way not only did i understand it i enjoyed it
6055,W  Hagewood,great professor helps you as much as needed this was such an easy a lots of homeworj but tests were not hard
6056,W  Hagewood,stick with it and it will be an easy a
6057,W  Hagewood,very easy in all your homework easy a and also tests are open notes and sometimes open questions on the test come straight from very nice main and also has bonus got an a in this class and i am horrible in math
6058,W  Hagewood,nice professor
6059,S  Fenton,ms fenton is cool she does not count attendance as a grade but she notices if students are not present so do not skip class take her class she will call on you to answer questions in class so be prepared to speak when called upon oh show all of your work on tests memorize all formulas early in the semester she cares
6060,S  Fenton,i had prof fenton for algebra she lectures over everything you need to know but moves very quickly and if you slow her down she will make you feel dumb for asking a question if you pay attention show up for class and do the homework its an easy a
6061,S  Fenton,i had professor fenton for college algebra she made all the concepts very clear and worked through problems in a very thorough manner she always makes time for questions and will work with anyone who is having trouble with the material
6062,S  Fenton,interesting like everyone else said make you feel dumb if you slow her down with questions but she is still willing to help very understanding if respectful but i exactly recommend her if you are semi good at math and pay attention for the most part you should be okay though
6063,S  Fenton,i recommend this class if you know you are not great at math she moves really fast if you slow her down by asking a question make you feel stupid
6064,S  Fenton,professor fenton saved my bacon more than once i took her for college algebra math and i mix very well i made a d my first time through b in the maymester course she is a wonderful teacher and always tries to help her students if you have problems you be afraid to speak up she also gives partial credit in maymester course
6065,S  Fenton,professor fenton is brilliant her class was very hard for me though i felt like she had a very difficult time getting across what she was teaching she starts a point and then changes it or times before she gets it sorted out in her mind sweet and helpful though
6066,S  Fenton,i took prof fenton for math and i struggle with math she is very sweet but she is very confusing when she tries to teach she got upset when we asked questions and when i asked for help she made me feel stupid i did not enjoy her class and recommend her
6067,S  Fenton,this was the second time i had taken college algebra previously i had scored a c with prof fenton i recieved an a i really enjoyed her class she took the time to explain things well and she had patience with everyone in the class
6068,S  Fenton,i had fenton for math it was basically the online class with class time we did everything online never used my book so just get the online code i do not struggle in math so i did fine i know others that really did struggle and she really helped them a little socially awkward but still nice i would take her again
6069,S  Fenton,i am actually good at math so i did not struggle in this class i did my assignments and that was all i had to do never had to study i know others that struggled and she really worked with them so they would understand and make a good grade her social skills are a little off but she is really nice i would take her again
6070,S  Fenton,i had her for college algebra this summer and she was wonderful i have never been good at math and she would explain it to me until i understood she is very serious about math but i think awesome that my math teacher likes math very sweet and a great teacher
6071,S  Fenton,a good teacher but boring most of the time reccommend her
6072,S  Fenton,i had fenton for and johnson for and i have to say johnson is way better fenton gets lost in mid sentence a lot she seems to be nice but lacks social skills her tests are hard even when she gives a study guide i am in no way trying to talk about her bad i just believe johnson is way better at teaching the subject
6073,S  Fenton,she is a nice lady but sort of hard to understand and really scatterbrained i truly think she wants her students to pass but she exactly easy to understand and her tests are difficult especially since she teaches the new lesson right before the test on the last chapter it makes it confusing
6074,S  Fenton,shes super sweet and wants to help but shes a bit scatterbrained did not let me make up a test when i missed for illness so be careful about that and make sure you talk to her when you have to miss
6075,S  Fenton,i really have a problem with her its just that she teaches in a very weird way and different from what been taught prior and she treats college algebra like its the most important class you will ever take i take her again
6076,S  Fenton,a nice lady but not the best teacher she gets off track and kind of bounces around in her lessons each question on her tests count for a ridiculous amount of points she also seems like one of those people who let things build up then will explode on you if i had to do it over again i take her
6077,S  Fenton,tests count as a rediculous amount but gives opportunity for redemption
6078,S  Fenton,talk about a professor that cares she will do whatever it takes to explain it to you i would for sure take her if you feel you need a kind rather meek teacher that can really teach super nice
6079,M  Morrison,best math teacher i ever had
6080,M  Morrison,professor morrison is a genuinely nice and humorous person and creates an extremely conducive classroom environment for learning trig
6081,Muldrow  Kyle,i had prof muldrow for math and computer and he is very easy to talk to he is funny in a goofy way he is very helpful you just have to ask i have had three of his classes i wish i could take my last math class with him i truly recommend taking whatever classes he is teaching
6082,Muldrow  Kyle,very nice guy he will go over everything with you stepbystep he does not give too much homework he is funny in a very dorky way
6083,Muldrow  Kyle,this guy is a awesomest teacher he has a really funny dorky personality he makes the class fun and is willing to give his students a break his lectures are really really helpful
6084,Muldrow  Kyle,funny guy likes stoogis reviews are exactly like quizes just study
6085,Muldrow  Kyle,muldrow rocks hes funny and very understanding knows his stuff and makes learning fun w00t for cis120 root beer floats id take him over any prof any day
6086,Muldrow  Kyle,nice professor knows stuff

6089,K  Jones,i took her online elementary algebra class she was an okay teacher the videos and notes were very helpful but she really that helpful she took forever responding to emails and she let you make up any work she the worst teacher but she the best either
6090,K  Jones,ms jones is an awesome professor she is really nice and if you pay attention she makes math easy to comprehend
6091,K  Jones,i really liked ms jones i thought she was a great teacher and i would recommend her for people who are afraid of algebra and need extra help
6092,K  Jones,i would never take her again the homework was on the computer and the test were on paper and if the clas doesnt understand something and you ask a question she says she has office hours most people had stopped coming by the end of the semevery sit was packed at the start if your not good with math on the computer i wouldnt take her
6093,K  Jones,she was unwilling to help she taught horrible but i will give her the credit of being a nice person

6096,K  Jones,ms jones is an excellent teacher she goes over our homework with us in class works the problems out on the board and goes step by step through the problem she move on till whoever was confused is now clear on the issue she goes into great detail teaching math and explains math in terms of our everyday life take her for math

6100,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i took dr online psychology course he is a tough grader and you must turn everything in on time he does not respond to emails right away however if you email him he will answer any questions or concerns you may have you must participate in discussions or you will fail this class is very fast paced but interesting
6101,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i have struggled with this class this semester online teacher requires you to sign in and respond to posts on different days which kind of defeats the purpose of online classes and working at my schedule terrible response time on emails i have been waiting for a response on an assignment for a week now whole class has same issue
6102,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i took her online development psychology course it was kind of hard to stay on top of the assignments she would make a lot of things due on one day about a month ahead of time and let the students do it as they pleased some may like this approach but i found it difficult to remember to do assignments until the last minute
6103,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i took professor general psych class online for a filler class worst professor had in years takes a long time to respond and very tough grader with no response for help take his class again not online at least
6104,Sidney E.  Hardyway,so glad i read his reviews before i started work in his class if you take him make sure you are detailed with the module questions i mean pages per module and only use his links to answer the questions he gives unlimited attempts on tests so take advantage be active with discussions too class is a lot of work but learn a lot
6105,Sidney E.  Hardyway,he was a very tough grader but graded very fairly to what you actually knew i used the textbook quite a lot also to answer his questions he has certain papers to write that you need the textbook for or else you might not get a good grade but overall he was a great professor and i am very glad i took him for psychology
6106,Sidney E.  Hardyway,he is very specific on how assignments are completed make sure you complete initial discussion posts b4 deadline retake exam testshe gives unlimited attempts you must be detailed and give essay answers in your own words class is not hard but requires lots of grading if you follow directions and he offered e.c
6107,Sidney E.  Hardyway,refused to grade my assignments citing book page number not shown when i even have the book it was listed on the class website that i would receive credit if i used and cited the class page sources which i did when i complained to him about this he gave me next to nothing points for the assignments then a few weeks out from the end of the semester he told me there was no way i could redo my assignments and that i would need to make perfect scores on all assignments and quizzes and tests from then until the end of the semester if i wanted to pass even having the gall to suggest retaking the class during the summer horrible teacher do not take his class if i could give a rating lower than one star i would
6108,Sidney E.  Hardyway,literally win teacher essay them pg either i really suck at essay questions or he just hates me but i got out of points my heart sank research activitycombined part with part3 because they were the same he give me the points for part2 because according to him i complete it boo
6109,Sidney E.  Hardyway,loved this class i took it in high school and often find myself comparing him to professors i have now he is so funny and lectures were interesting we even took a field trip to a prison very helpful and knows how to entertain students
6110,Sidney E.  Hardyway,a student have to turn in assignments over and over to get credit for work they have already completed i constantly had to reprint assignments he also asked questions in class that you got points for but write down the right people to receive points may have to take class again bc it hurt my gpa and i am an a student sucks
6111,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i had him for psych online i do not recommend taking his class online he is a very smart guy and the class is well organized test open discussion research project and essay questions once or twice a month the test are not that bad with google but the essay questions will hurt your grade big time if you are a lazy take
6112,Sidney E.  Hardyway,he is a good teacher tests are extremely hard if you read the chapters thoroughly it will give you a lot better of an understanding there is not a lot of supplemental materials for what to study tests are over chapter and i find it difficult to know the most significant topics out of chapter stay involved in discussions
6113,Sidney E.  Hardyway,worst teacher i have ever had let me explain why he has one assignment where you have to answer essay questions so i answered them all with a pretty large paragraph each but i forgot to include what page numbers i found each answer from in the book so i got a grade so i could have just gave the page numbers and got a
6114,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i am in his online class right now and i hate it he rarely sends out emails and when i emailed him about a test it took him over a week to reply it helpful at all his tests have nothing to do with the subject although you do have the option of taking it twice if you want maybe better in person i take him again though
6115,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i took psyc1030 online with him i did get a b but it was endless hours of busy work having little to do with understanding the subject he accept late work and any questions if answered at all were answered after the assignment due date had passed rendering them useless i would not recommend him or take him again
6116,Sidney E.  Hardyway,took his class while still in hs gotta take him in person his tests are hard and he makes questions almost impossible to get bc his actual philosophy of what psych is researched dsmv for a book of opinions and there are no rights or wrongs he convincingly reinacts symptoms of disorders briliant fun
6117,Sidney E.  Hardyway,took this class online his tests are very hard on the homework assignments being very detailed increases your grade make sure to follow instructions carefully on research activities or you will lose major points i enjoyed the class though and would take him again
6118,Sidney E.  Hardyway,dr.hardway was great the class is was easy test are not easy you have to read overall he is a great teacher
6119,Sidney E.  Hardyway,i took him online this summer his tests are crazy hard and some of the questions i find in the book nor on google after the exam i received and on tests but aced the homework assignments they take forever to finish but the more detailed you are the better your grade post often on discussion boards i still got an a
6120,P  Lawson,a sweet woman but man her lectures were based on opinion and the actual work was online its not fair because if we wanted an online course we would have taken one but oh well overall dont take her unless you want to be forced into hearing her very biased opinion watching boring films from the and doing everything online
6121,P  Lawson,teacher was terrible made a b in the class but nothing of what she says in class will be on the tests or quizzes she has some computer program make them for her and the questions come out of the text she has a attendance policy but i could have made the same grade without ever stepping foot in her class
6122,P  Lawson,i hated her class so disorganized and would go off topic very easily quizes were nothing she had said in class tests are online and that was the only good part about it
6123,P  Lawson,do not take this woman for a video course for one it will turn into an online course two the workload is absolutely ridiculous if you do you will regret it
6124,P  Lawson,took the class on video i will never do that again all material came straight from the book only two tests so they covered at least chapters each the text was a horrible read i recommend not taking her especially not during the summer
6125,P  Lawson,she liked to single minorities out and ask them things about their culture i would have felt uncomfortable it were me
6126,P  Lawson,she is very hard i ended up changing teachers because i was spending more time outside class doing the assisgments that was required she also requires you to turn in everything online and take every test online so if you do not have a computer and do not want to spend your entire semester on this class only do not take her
6127,P  Lawson,mrs lawson is out to brain wash all of her student into thinking like she does she insists that you agree with her and if you she might throw you out of class do not waste your time
6128,P  Lawson,a little collectivist but goodhearted
6129,P  Lawson,she is the meanest womman ever met she needs to retire and you wont learn a thing
6130,P  Lawson,very funny
6131,P  Lawson,mrs lawson was a great teacher she uses the book website for all of the quizzes and tests people that read fast take her her online quizzes and tests are timed it seems only the slow readers complained about that she uses a lot of supplemental material in class which i thought was great i would recommend her to anyone
6132,P  Lawson,ok teacher notes in class do not pertain to test go to the website and read chapter summary and take chapter test a lot of questions come from there read book a lot make sure you take notes on the movie clips beacuse she uses those on the final overall she was an ok teacher
6133,P  Lawson,ms lawson this is the most hardiest class i ever took in my life take notes in class but not on her tests use publisher website alot tests are very hard most of every thing is online as far as tests quizes and assigments also every thing oniine as far as tests and quizes are timed
6134,P  Lawson,she is extremely liberal if attendance required i would have never gone to class the things that she lectures on the test any way but you must take notes because that will be your final exam everything is online and all straight from the book i like her teaching style or her opinions at all
6135,P  Lawson,ms lawson is a pretty good teacher be prepared to read though nothing said in class is on the tests use the website a lot it is a tremendous help she has a habit of talking about her personal beliefs though which can get annoying paying to learn psych not listen to her beliefs
6136,P  Lawson,she is an okay teacher good luck on the test nothing she says in class is on her test test comes straight from the book you better read
6137,P  Lawson,i loved ms lawson great teacher
6138,P  Lawson,she has to be one of the greatest teachers
6139,P  Lawson,i liked her teaching style if thinking about taking her go ahead learn a lot and it will be an easy grade however i warn about her quizes on the computer it sucks being timed while doing a quiz but get the hang of it
6140,Charisse  Coston,thought this class was easy as long as you go to class just the paper and the presentation is your grades she literally tells you exactly what to put in the paper if you go to class gotten an a but i used an outline during the presentation
6141,Charisse  Coston,no intellectual bullying i liked this
6142,Charisse  Coston,loved the professor extra credit helps
6143,Charisse  Coston,enjoyed the class enjoyed the professor wish every one read the material
6144,Charisse  Coston,liked the number of graded assignments
6145,Charisse  Coston,i liked the way she taught we got written and oral credit it was a lot of worl but it was all well worth it
6146,Charisse  Coston,good class liked the paper of my work even though it is not criminal justice take her
6147,Charisse  Coston,interesting class
6148,Charisse  Coston,loved her and her class she really cares if you get it
6149,Charisse  Coston,great class thought her book was great
6150,Charisse  Coston,i was really excited to take this class but it really disappointed the worst thing that happened this semester was the online book she made us buy but then told us not to use it after test and we get a refund this class attendance based but i would really suggest going because the tests are hard
6151,Charisse  Coston,she has experience in the field so she knows what she is talking about and provides good insight has guest speakers attendance not mandatory will do anything to help you if you ask
6152,Charisse  Coston,great interest great professor
6153,Charisse  Coston,only grades in the class are exams tests are easy if you take notes and study tests are multiple choice gives a few extra credit points if you go to class she shows several movies and has several guest speakers great class and great professor would absolutely take again attendance not mandatory and textbook not needed
6154,Charisse  Coston,challenging class excellent lectures
6155,Charisse  Coston,good teacher always there to help easy a only tests that are questions each
6156,Charisse  Coston,nice lectures are easy in the sense that no participation and we get out of class early a lot she can be confusing though in lectures and rambles we watched a lot of videos and had some guest speakers we really have review sessions for exams and pretty hard she go over exams with you after the test is taken
6157,Charisse  Coston,it is her class so she can say because i said so i think that she is smart and loved the class
6158,Charisse  Coston,the class has nothing to do with criminal justice i did not learn anything but how to write the paper that is due at the end of class
6159,Charisse  Coston,i love dr coston she is great and very helpful it was a pleasure taking a class with her and look forward to take more classes she really care for students
6160,F  Goosetree,fantastic teacher very helpful she only required to read the chapter and take a quiz
6161,F  Goosetree,aka mrs hurley shes such a great teacher very easy and gets your final project out of the way during the or weeks she gives time for everything and your very rarely in there for the whole period
6162,F  Goosetree,no comments
6163,F  Goosetree,i really like mrs goostree she is a nice person and her class is really fun
6164,F  Goosetree,she is a wonderful teacher i highly recommened taking her
6165,P  Hinkle,ms hinkle was the best so nice and encouraging she understands the adult learners that she teaches great class
6166,P  Hinkle,so easy her quizzes are harder than her tests because the tests are the exact same questions that were on the quizzes that she gives back
6167,Vanessa  Mitchell,had her for two psychology classes psyc1030 and psyc2130 she is an amazing teacher and she knows what doing she also does her best to help her students and goes over the lecture thoroughly i recommend any of you to have her if you can
6168,Vanessa  Mitchell,definitely one of my favorite classes while i was at vol state she made the class very fun to learn in she is very cool and was very understanding about me having a class at another school you be shy or embarrassed in her class because use her psychology on you but if you get the chance to take her take her she is really cool
6169,Vanessa  Mitchell,i had to dance the nutcracker in front of the whole class if i she was going to take away points we had to take selfies with strangers in public basically we did a ton of stupid stuff that had no relation to psychology she said we need a book then test time comes and she says read your chapters she never taught us anything
6170,Vanessa  Mitchell,i say whether prof mitchell knows her stuff or not she just posted the same cookiecutter material used in every gen psych class but do not expect her to work with you in an emergency and do not expect any kind of feedback at all
6171,Vanessa  Mitchell,be prepared to teach yourself if you take this class online instructor offers no help she very rarely checks or responds to emails i was excited at first to take this class and ended up very disappointed
6172,Vanessa  Mitchell,ms mitchell is awesome she is so nice and willing to help if needed she makes her classes interesting and fun i have taken of her classes and i wish i could take more the only time i have ever looked forward to going to school is when i was in her class
6173,Vanessa  Mitchell,i felt that she really help us out at all online we essentially taught ourselves from the textbook then on top of that she would make of the test about things that covered in the textbook how are we supposed to know these things if we are teaching ourselves
6174,Vanessa  Mitchell,now she is a awesome makes you want to come to class to see what is gonna happen you learn so much in there and yet you feel like your doing anything you do need to study for the tests but she gives a study guide piaget is huge in her teaching so lok him up and know all you can about him you rock ms mitchell love ya
6175,Vanessa  Mitchell,great teacher
6176,Vanessa  Mitchell,miss mitchell made my semester i really ought to talk about her knowledgeability and the way she makes the material fun and interesting to the vast majority of disinterested students but all that pales in comparison to my huge crush on her shew yeah she really kills me leave it at that
6177,Vanessa  Mitchell,excellent teacher treats everyone fair she have pets and she seems to really enjoy teaching
6178,Vanessa  Mitchell,wonderful teacher def the best at vol state very helpful and amazingly nice to everyone
6179,Vanessa  Mitchell,shes always willing to explain what shes talking about
6180,Vanessa  Mitchell,mrs mitchell is the best instructor at vscc hands down she really goes above beyond to help anyone who needs it would highly recommend her if you want to have fun learn at the same time
6181,Vanessa  Mitchell,amazing teacher
6182,Vanessa  Mitchell,mrs mitchell is such a sweet lady and a great teacher she is willing to help a student in anyway that she can a great overall teacher i wish there were more teachers like her
6183,Vanessa  Mitchell,mrs mitchell is wonderful i say enough nice things about her she is very intelligent and willing to do anything to help a student i highly recommend her
6184,Vanessa  Mitchell,i love mrs mitchell she seems so interested in teaching and seems like she loves what she does she tries to get everyone involved and i think that is great
6185,Vanessa  Mitchell,very sweet teacher i like her lots of class discussion
6186,Vanessa  Mitchell,love her she is the best
6187,J  Burton,had as video gave study guides which made the test very easy to pass there is a lot of textbook use in this class you have to read the text and take really detailed notes on the video or you will not pass very nice woman
6188,J  Burton,no comments
6189,J  Burton,not an easy class but a good one to take gave take home tests that were very hard but manageable also had a couple papers to write not too hard though was an overall good professor to take would recommend to anyone
6190,J  Burton,very good teacher give alot of hoomework she helps review with test good class
6191,R  Dauer,i loved mrs.dauer
6192,R  Dauer,mrs dauer was incredibly nice funny and down to earth she made class interesting by showing videos and incorporating daily life and the media into our discussions i would highly recommend her
6193,R  Dauer,no comments
6194,R  Dauer,mrs dauer is one of the nicest teachers ever had her class too difficult we even had a party in class very helpful i would highly recommend her
6195,R  Dauer,no comments
6196,Kathleen  Cummins,absolutely wonderful she can be slightly vague at times but mostly gets the point across i like that she is thorough with her marking
6197,Kathleen  Cummins,she is just amazing very nice person and great to look at too i use to attend her class just to see her had her for media story telling class and it was great fun
6198,Kathleen  Cummins,really good teacher
6199,Kathleen  Cummins,she is way too kind hearted and gets taken advantage of most people sleep in her class because they come in the first place those that do get to see some decent movies overall i liked her even though many thought she was unclear at times
6200,Kathleen  Cummins,great teacher great person
6201,Martha  Malaty,there is a good amount of homework although if you read up be fine she teach much in class mostly youtube videos and she jumps from slide to slide without explaining how they relate to another tests are ridiculously hard and confusing half of the content has never been gone over or even mensioned in for a ride
6202,Martha  Malaty,she literally will not teach you anything if you are a comp sci major i hope you already know how to use java if you are taking it for credits even think about taking this excuse for a professor you will fail if you think you did all the homework right which you probably did she will still give you
6203,Martha  Malaty,lecture with errors and youtube channels are of the material covered in class unless the students are engaged she tends to move clearly knowledgeable in the subject but not the clearest on answering questions and a little hostile in answering questions even though she encourages them
6204,Martha  Malaty,tough grader she expects too much for an introduction class lots of homework no extra credit
6205,Martha  Malaty,good instructor a grading criteria is given for each assignment but does not display how picky she is so be sure to be very precise when assembling your homework folders gives detailed feedback very caring encourages questions lectures are slightly confusing but she spends quite some time clarifying things with you if you ask for help
6206,Martha  Malaty,she is a so so teacher she truly cares about the students be prepared to learn the majority of the content on your own i got an a in this class she is a very easy grader the people who said she was a tough grader and gave hard exams are the ones who did not prepare this is a tough subject you need to study
6207,Martha  Malaty,barnone the worst professor had throughout different institutions only take her class if you are already an expert on programming lectures are vague and unhelpful no study guides but very difficult nasty attitude broken english grades ruthlessly lots of homework material not covered in class
6208,Martha  Malaty,she will give many extra credits i think her logic and lecture is clear if focus on what she said and no tired of questions we have to be really careful with homework because of so many details i learn preciseness and patience from her
6209,Martha  Malaty,i finished her class and i am very disappointed about her class i can say that there is nothing except that reading her confusing lectures watching videos on youtube and doing her tough homeworks be careful to read her long assignments because she is a tough grader and she help you at all
6210,Martha  Malaty,although she is pretty touch for grading but nice and really help you to learn the truth of how programming really is if you are serious about your career as cs engineer so take her i like her commitment in teaching overall very helpful when you come to her office for
6211,Martha  Malaty,assigns a ton of homework said be able to do my work on my mac if i purchased office365 which didnt come with the required software for class her lack of knowledge of current computer software and stubbornness caused me a lot of stress i ended with a getting a c she did not round up even knowing the extra time i put into class
6212,Martha  Malaty,horrible worst class i have ever taken and she is no help at all online for a reason and expects you to come to her office hours for help when you email and show exactly the problem is and just need a better clarification of it all and nothing no help not recommended
6213,Martha  Malaty,dont take this class
6214,Martha  Malaty,a good teacher overall if you are not experienced programming i would recommend you take python before hand or some moocs otherwise it will be a little bit tough not because of her teaching style but more so the java language that other students find tough and this class will prepare you for more so than python
6215,Martha  Malaty,this class is not recommended she expects so much from her students but teaches so little prior to the work supposed to do take the class if you already know how to program but beware for she takes points off if you program the way she does
6216,Martha  Malaty,professor malaty has a very poor teaching structure from day one she expects you to know how to write a program and she annoyed when your asking her for help only take her class as a last resort
6217,Martha  Malaty,instructor is very disorganized often makes mistakes and is easily confused this really sound like the proper mindset for teaching programming and it shows on the first day of class only take this class if its required or if you plan to selfstudy
6218,Martha  Malaty,i never felt the need to write a review about a professor until taking cs prof malaty is quite possibly the worst teacher ever experienced she comes to class unprepared and is annoyed by any question being asked even if crucial to the lesson i got an a after thoroughly reading the book and collaboring other students stay away
6219,Martha  Malaty,ignore her lectures read the book she is wellmeaning but her lectures are abysmal i got fed up and just resorted to relying on wikipedia for key terms and concepts a full semester later and i ended up teaching myself very exhausting for people not familiar with programming
6220,Martha  Malaty,whe it comes to teaching the students she is all over the place if you are a beginner you have to rely solely on the textbook not helpfull whatsoever and she seems like she come prepare to class she is very forgetful and if you try to follow relize that you are being misguided unless you catch it or someone else in class does
6221,Ramin  Zabih,medical literacy was amazing it got me excited about diverse medical fields ramin lecture himself but behind the scenes organized group of practicing physicians from weill cornell medicine every session was a case study and explored a field the session on lung cancer made me quit smoking so this class extended my life span by years
6222,Ramin  Zabih,i did not like the lack of organization on the hws and exams tas write the hws and half of each exam i was told the class gets harder every year with minutes left on each prelim we got extra minutes but no extra time on the final so expect it all the time overall that made me feel a lack of trust do well on the final
6223,Ramin  Zabih,his first time teaching in years lectures were not pertinent much and not updated online until right before final problem sets were managed solely by the tas prelims were fine grade in class is almost solely based on final as stated by email afterwards a decent person but do try to stay away as far as class goes
6224,Ramin  Zabih,extremely careless about classes lecture notes are updated month later those for the finals been updated yet
6225,Ramin  Zabih,ramin is amazing extremely interesting lectures really knows his stuff enthusiastic about the subject best cs class i have taken you really learn a lot about cs rather than just programming
6226,Ramin  Zabih,incredible class ramin makes intro cs extremely interesting while other cs100 classes were doing mindnumbing pointless programming assignments we actually learned useful cs applications and picked up the programming as we went
6227,Ramin  Zabih,ramin is a god being taught by a genius like this is a true blessing
6228,Ramin  Zabih,taking with ramin really kindled my interest in cs a dynamic and lucid lecturer with a flair for the material his exams were engaging the homework was interesting and manageable i hear good things about machine vision but comment from personal experience
6229,Ramin  Zabih,took class fall funny guy once asked the students why they took a lecture um we were freshmen we had little choice exams and assignments were difficult but fair
6230,Ramin  Zabih,students should complain about the material not the teacher this guy was really great in machine vision great sense of humor and definitely one of the top lecturers in the cs dept
6231,Ramin  Zabih,he managed to make lectures confusing even without using powerpoint
6232,Ramin  Zabih,course textbook guide to the galaxy variable names ford arthur and hhgtg were common lots of intel references on a whole really liked his teaching style wierd geeky humor
6233,Ramin  Zabih,went on personal rants all the time and really teach us much about the material extremely hard to get a hold of and the grading was a constant mess i will avoid him in the future
6234,Ramin  Zabih,clear thoughtout lectures coursework can be demanding and tedious at times has a strange pechant for thhgttg
6235,Ramin  Zabih,given that the material is difficult ramin is pretty good at explaining it he could be better sometimes his examples too quickly and his explanations are not always direct he will however make you understand all the major concepts
6236,Ramin  Zabih,conceited the class is marked by arrogant speeches that sound as if doing the students some kind of enormous favour by teaching them very hard to get a hold of outside of class a disorganized lecturer and the coursework is extremely hard
6237,Ramin  Zabih,ramin is a very dedicated teacher he takes the class very seriously and an interesting lecturer not the best teacher ever but damn damn good
6238,Bonnie  Bedford,it was years ago but if anyone sees her tell her sean to know me is to love me evans says hi she wrote a great play regarding a sniper incident too
6239,Bonnie  Bedford,i love bonnie bedford i think incredible
6240,Bonnie  Bedford,no comments
6241,Bonnie  Bedford,very full of herself not a very good writer and she plays favorites very phony
6242,Bonnie  Bedford,classes were great papers were hard show up with the plays read and papers done and you will get an a but she is not going to do the work for you however she read most papers so do really well for a couple of weeks and then you can slack off because she judges your first paper
6243,Bonnie  Bedford,she was pretty good her class was both fun and easy i see what everyone is complaining about probably stupid if you did not like bedford
6244,Bonnie  Bedford,she was the best instrctor of the semester work all that har and ended up with because i missed days
6245,Bonnie  Bedford,terrible
6246,Bonnie  Bedford,no comments
6247,David  Martin,i dont understand why he is useless david martin has specific teaching experience there are times the class is tough to understand but he makes you work for it giving you quizzes every week in class a big deal it wakes you up he gives lab homework and his grades assignments hes not like other teachers that dont grade hw
6248,David  Martin,i just feel like he just made his course difficult on purpose on the first day he told us that more than of his students fail so i know if its his fault or the students he gives out quizzes everyday which is fine but what he teaches in class is completely irrelevant to what he gives out just as stated in the comments below
6249,David  Martin,he is a nice guy but his teaching style is really hard to understand
6250,David  Martin,his class was okay i would recommend lots of studying outside of class because his voice is little monotone so makes you sleepy in class
6251,David  Martin,keep this review simple dont take himm
6252,David  Martin,worst cis teacher ever seriously he needs to retire or something he seems like a pretty decent guy but what he teaches is completely irrelevant to what he gives out in his exams trust me just take another teacher and get a better grade
6253,David  Martin,cis in general is a pretty boring you basically learning the fundamentals of programming so look for this class to be extremely fun just study hard learn these fundamentals and look forward to taking cis trust me make sure you take professor kendall martin for her teaching style is inspiring and you work on cool stuff
6254,David  Martin,he definitely prepares you for make sure you read the book ahead of or after he lectures on this topic the book definitely explain concepts alot better reason why i feel he prepared me was because he tests you on every detail explained in the book which is needed in understanding java so you can program fun stuff in
6255,David  Martin,awful makes a very difficult subject even more difficult java the easiest subject in the world to learnand he makes it even more difficult some people are great teachers some are great business people you need to know your strengths care if great in business lousy at teaching a difficult subject that i love java
6256,David  Martin,i took him twice i felt the difficulty of his class was fair the exams were short answer and multiple choice the daily quizzes he gives do help you papare for the exams his grading criteria is clearly laid out if you do the homework you should be able to pass the class with no issuies
6257,David  Martin,take this professor if you have learning differences his learning style work for someone who has learning issues labs vary quizzes are almost daily which is fine but he explain the material in simple terms he makes things complicated than they need to be his voice will make you go to sleep i love compsci
6258,David  Martin,follows the syllabus you will have a quiz at the beginning of each class based on the current topic all test and quizzes are open book test your knowledge on quizzes to see your proficiency on the topic through tricky questions
6259,David  Martin,expects you to have basic knowledge before class and have all chapters read doesnt waste any class time and uses all of his time proficiently he is quite experienced and a knowledgeable programmer although he is not good at teaching
6260,David  Martin,i am not sure this is the right class for mr martin to teach i felt that most of the class was confused on the overall subject he did give his all and was very nice and definitely knew the teaching us the information was not clear enough that may be because of a student who kept disrupting the class
6261,David  Martin,lots of real world practical experience
6262,David  Martin,professor martin covers the material very well and clearly has a passion for it after the first few classes it becomes obvious that he is a computer veteran with enormous amounts of experience he provides a great overall learning experience and many examples from his career for the practical reasons behind material covered great professor
6263,David  Martin,prof d martin is a absolute gentleman open book quizs multiple choice exams lots of extra credits lowered bar he does everything to help you pass the class there is one minor thing about him though sometimes he spends too much time helping out students who falls behind some advanced students may find this little boring
6264,David  Martin,very traditional teacher but more than fair he gives out a generous amount of extra credit and does everything he can to help you if yon need it would recommend
6265,David  Martin,this guy was meant to teach computers been in the business for quite some time and knows the way things work i wanted to take assembler with him put they had to cancel the class in my opinion he is the best instructor they have in the cis department only had of them but best
6266,David  Martin,great visual basic instructor class was informative and enjoyable would take a course from him again
6267,Nicolas  Robidoux,great guy always willing to meet and help out super funny made class worth going to wish he was still at lu
6268,Nicolas  Robidoux,he usually late by over minutes he is a busy guy cut him some slack the tests were fair and if you got the prep work do well if bad at math blame him he was a funny guy yet still taught well unlike many math profs he just copy the book all the processes were right even if he made a few mistakes with s
6269,Nicolas  Robidoux,hes an amazing marker u cant fail his course
6270,Nicolas  Robidoux,very good sense of humour teaching methods did not work well for me minimal interaction with students several of my friends did very well though and enjoyed his lectures would prefer a tutorial rather than an extra mins of classtime fair tests but the exam was written by another professor and was not very related to what what we learned
6271,Nicolas  Robidoux,how to describe this prof he is always late for class there is no tutorial because he uses it to teach needs help from student when he makes mistakes tests were rediculously long and the class was never prepared should not be teaching
6272,Nicolas  Robidoux,what can i say about him he is annoying when he snaps his fingers or goes euuhh he comes to class disorganized posts our hwk like days before a test and expect us to do good when we have a million other things to do although he makes me laugh a lot which is good compared to most teachers
6273,Nicolas  Robidoux,an excellent teacher he brings a sense of humour to the classroom that is sorely missed he presents information in a clear manner and openly encourages the class to participate in the lecture this interaction is a great bonus he certainly knows his stuff and makes it available to all the class i was dreading to take has become my favourite
6274,Nicolas  Robidoux,what can i say about robidoux the guy really has no idea what hes doing he comes to class incredibly disorganized and wastes our time teaching useless proofs he actually has to get the students to point out his mistakes otherwise the stuff he teaches would be completely wrong
6275,Nicolas  Robidoux,sometimes you feel like a nut
6276,Nicolas  Robidoux,this teacher always has something funny to say he has an interesting bonus mark system only complaint i have is that his tests are very long
6277,Nicolas  Robidoux,this teacher makes all his tests and exams too long so that everyone fails because they dont have time to finish and most of the stuff on his test r things he didnt even teach yet in class completely disorganized
6278,Nicolas  Robidoux,the guys a lunatic never prepared for teaching his course
6279,Nicolas  Robidoux,awesome teacher always willing to help he makes the class fun
6280,Nicolas  Robidoux,i know about you but if i take notes during lectures pretty much up the creek without a paddle there to learn not to fail
6281,Randall  Warwick,i took this class these past weeks in the fall of and i thought it was going to consists a lot more work like people were saying honestly i learned a lot from the labs we were assigned and he strongly believes in all students there is nothing that be possible in this class i would highly recommend him to anyone thanks again
6282,Randall  Warwick,awesome course and i am very glad i took it if you are decided on him and another teacher take him this is a perfect ge course for life science if you are not a science major there are about quizzes discussion current event assignment a midterm and a final it sounds like a lot but it really
6283,Randall  Warwick,i hardly used the textbook and still ended up with an a he sets you up to excel and for us nonscience majors it is much appreciated i definitely recommend this professor
6284,Randall  Warwick,hilarious guy must take this is a gpa booster i had him as an online class and i was cracking up while reading the study guide take him
6285,Randall  Warwick,hilarious man i enjoyed attending his classes i highly recommend him for nonbio majors
6286,Randall  Warwick,i highly recommend this online class it is pretty clear and easy a do the work and you will get the grade prof suggested to get mylab but use it at all the discussions req are clear and easy the prof is understanding and works with you on anything without out double questioning awesome teacher for being online
6287,Randall  Warwick,professor warwick is the best i took his online course plus the lab and i actually learned a lot he explains bio in a way in his lab book that normal people can comprehend i highly recommend him if you stay up to task you will get an a he is very understanding and you can email him with best prof ever
6288,Randall  Warwick,i took his class a few years ago and i really liked him he seems like a genuinely nice person and he has a really funny sense of humor i recommend his class
6289,Randall  Warwick,of our grade participation was given by attending class was awarded for doing inclass readings and small projects in which he would rarely assign quizzes are easy online and of our grade midterm and final are of the grade are also online tests you take at home if you get an a in this class sad lol
6290,Randall  Warwick,professor warwick is amazing he is funny and super understanding one time i got an answer wrong on a quiz and i gave him an explanation as to why i chose that specific answer and he liked my explanation and said that he would add that point back on he is eager to help and i highly recommend taking his class wish i could take his class again
6291,Randall  Warwick,this is a nonmajor biology class this is a freegiveaway course just to boost up your gpa just take it and you will get an a lots and lots of extra credit
6292,Randall  Warwick,up to you if you want to get anything out of the class so easy just do the work and get an a the lab can be harder
6293,Randall  Warwick,easy class and lab the lab kit is ridiculously expensive for a box of basic stuff you can find at home straw clothespin etc lab manual is only difference is the lab sheets are different color easy a if you just need class for general education requirement
6294,Randall  Warwick,i took both biology and the lab you cannot use used lab manual kit you have to buy new each semester because he uses different colored lab sheets labs are easy be careful if you search google for answers because some are wrong rent textbook instead to save money very easy class overall but it help you if you are science major
6295,Randall  Warwick,super easy but be ready to sit in class while he rambles about things that have absolutely nothing to do with biology or your lesson
6296,Randall  Warwick,an economics major so i was a little wary of taking biology without proper preparation however i passed this class with an a and with flying colors would recommend to all my friends
6297,Randall  Warwick,just take it trust me
6298,Randall  Warwick,lectures and important facts in seaport are a must read the book very well written but you will need it for some of the tests this class is straight forward weekly quizzes a midterm with essay and a final i highly recommend professor warwick i like his straight forward approach
6299,Randall  Warwick,professor warwick is wonderful he grades fairly and he round your grade at all so expect a higher grade however i guess my case was different because i had an after my final and he just gave me the a even though i expect it he is very attentive to his email and will always respond in a timely manner
6300,Randall  Warwick,five question mc quizzes super easy lab reports question mc midtermessay portion question mc finalessay portion google mc questions exactly i found all the answers i labs i think he even read them and got perfects i finished everything in weeks got a i learn anything but hey i got an
6301,Jessica  Wyman,her teaching is elementary she literally sat us down during one class and showed us a video of a man showing the process of how a first grader learned to draw a butterfly to a bunch of other first graders very rude take the time to have conversations with students and if you question any part of her teaching she snaps at you
6302,Jessica  Wyman,most uninspiring person at ocad she may be well educated but this self dubbed dragon woman is the least empathetic person i have ever met grading did not correspond with ass guidelines tried to ask for feedback as to y i failed she yelled at me rather than providing constructive criticism dropped her class took it in the summer got an a
6303,Jessica  Wyman,her guidelines for assignments match how she marks papers have any powerpoint presentations because all she does is talk we go to an art school we learn visually how do you not have visuals for take her class ever again
6304,Jessica  Wyman,she knows the history very well overall shes an alright person but at times she comes off as tough rude and strict but still her class is helpfull and you will learn alot
6305,Jessica  Wyman,jessica is awesome her course is challenging in a good way but she is reasonable with assignments does not give you lots of useless exercises a great lecturer great ideas funny very contemporary her class was a real pleasure and yes she is easy on the eyes
6306,Jessica  Wyman,no exaggeration the best professor i have had at the school approachable friendly and intelligent and can explain herself clearly and concisely you can tell she enjoys what she does and waht she teaches and teaches you everything you need to know to be critical and smart too a musthave for the school
6307,Jessica  Wyman,great stuff she really knows her stuff and conveys it enthusiastically and compellingly not the easiest of graders but fair easy on the eyes too
6308,Jessica  Wyman,her lectures were always well organized and informed she was an awesome prof to have you can tell she knows what she is talking about
6309,Jessica  Wyman,greatest teacher that i have had at ocad she takes the time to break down the text and explain everything possible in the little time that we have i hope that she continues to teach as a loss of her would mean disaster to the course itself
6310,Jessica  Wyman,cute but always teaches the wrong thing very moody and rude sigh
6311,Jessica  Wyman,sometimes moves around the place but is very very smart umm shes a sassy prof
6312,Jessica  Wyman,no comments
6313,Jessica  Wyman,amazing lecturer an absolute rock star up there she knows what to say and how to say it if you hate art history as i did get ready to be converted
6314,Jessica  Wyman,great very helpful very clear she screw you over answer questions to clarify anything and she has a great sense of humour
6315,Roy  Nutter,his lectures usually have nothing to do with the lesson nor do they relate to the textbook tests are all or nothing meaning you either get points in a question or points one little mistake in code and you lose all points i wish i was exaggerating your best bet is to hope his old tests make sense
6316,Roy  Nutter,the tests are word for word the practice test they are the exact same thing just memorize it lectures are boring and he makes a lot of mistakes on the board you can snooze through lecture be there for the quizzes and memorize the practice test and be fine very boring
6317,Roy  Nutter,really bad at grading tests questions are usually allornothing so while it might help you once in a blue moon if you show your work chances are you get any of the points for a question you get wrong anyways
6318,Roy  Nutter,good professor lectures are interesting makes the class fun to attend likes giving popquizzes homework is easy points takes attendance harsh grader on exams be as precise and clear with answers as possible or he wont give credit
6319,Roy  Nutter,good professor not the best teacher but he keeps the class is plenty entertaining and fairly easy
6320,Roy  Nutter,his analogies are a little off sure and old so he likes anecdotes also on be as precise as possible he took off for using abbreviations on diagrams that he used although since he did explain what they stood for some might say they were common knowledge for cpe majors you say wholly unfounded cut corners
6321,Roy  Nutter,nutter tells a lot of stories few of which have a lot to do with the material being covered quizzes come from the previous notes and the exams are very similar to the previous exams
6322,Roy  Nutter,although he uses analogies that really make sense to describe everything he is still a very straighforward professor take notes on class lectures and study those for the quizes the tests are exactly like the practice tests
6323,Roy  Nutter,ridiculous puts things on tests that he never goes over in class tests very unfair basically by the end of the semester hate him intensely so just save yourself the trouble and take anything teaching
6324,Roy  Nutter,roy nutter is the most unfair professer i have ever had he takes off points on some tests and not on others avoid him if possible when i went to him to talk about my test grade he laughed at me and made me even more angrier
6325,Roy  Nutter,horrible teacher avoid at all costs puts things on tests that he never goes over in class give much partial credit really seem to have a point when teaching overall just a crappy teacher take him unless you absolutely have to
6326,Roy  Nutter,the lectures were very interesting after we got out of assembly language tests were somewhat unfair the class was actually kinda fun to go to
6327,Roy  Nutter,great professor.likes to have quiz time at the start of most classes.most hw deals with topics from previous courses.tests are really fair.he pretty much tells you what each question will be before hand.i would recommend you take him for any and all classes possible
6328,Roy  Nutter,great guy he is not like any other professor because he stick to a schedule for a course new topics are made day to day and the material is broad does anyone ever remember details learned during a course a year later no learned a lot in his courses which help me life
6329,Roy  Nutter,tests are pretty much identical to practice tests he is somewhat forgetful and sometimes talks about off topic things for the whole class overall i enjoyed his classes and would def take him again
6330,Roy  Nutter,he kind of floats around likes attendance sheets and is overall pretty interesting he goes kind of slow so you can get bogged down in material just work the crossword or something to fill the time
6331,Roy  Nutter,if you go to class and study the practice test you will be fine he is very straightforward about what will be on the tests anyone who got less that an a in his class shuld be ashamed of themselves
6332,Roy  Nutter,dr nutter was my advisor on my senior project he was not very helpful and not very clear he is a fairly nice person though
6333,Roy  Nutter,awesome
6334,Roy  Nutter,no comments
6335,Jay  Dull,no comments
6336,Jay  Dull,pretty laid back
6337,Jeff  Kurtz,dr kurtz is a transformational educator very rarely do students have an opportunity to learn from a teacher such as him he does not parent you but he expects a mature student to be prepared and engaged each day he is wicked smart he is hilarious in his own awkward offbeat way he cares a lot about what he does and it shows simply great
6338,Jeff  Kurtz,i loved kurtz he is actually the best professor i have had in my total education career his passion for teaching makes you want to be in class he writes comments on papers that are hard to read but he is pretty clear in his office hours and class time about what is expected he is an amazing professor and you have to take a class with him
6339,Jeff  Kurtz,passionate about teaching willing to help and he cares about students and denison as a community some might call him unclear but just the nature of his class there to make you think and help you make connections if you understand his offbeat sense of humor realize actually a hilarious guy highly recommended
6340,Jeff  Kurtz,dr kurtz is an amazing professor he is passionate about his classes and his students the content is difficult but he is always willing to help and fair
6341,Jeff  Kurtz,really obscure he is unclear and not a very good teacher he sort of throws out big words and hopes that they sound intelligent but secretly not very smart easy if you like pandering to his desire for run of the mill phrases and simplistic insights all the books are redundant and similar good luck
6342,Jeff  Kurtz,this guy is crazy and i mean that in the best way possible very intelligent almost awkwardly so and has a really outthere way of lecturing very random too rarely a downright boring day and gotten progressively more interesting as the class goes on the material really interest me and i had a bit of difficulty on one of our papers but he took the time to explain what he wanted in the paper to me even though i still get it after the fifth explanation
6343,Jeff  Kurtz,very nice guy def a little to smart for his own good but never had a prof so willing to help tons of reading but it is intresting def a class that you fall asleep in
6344,Jeff  Kurtz,very nice guy but also very awkward seems almost too smart for his own good for being big on public speaking and whatnot not too good with the whole social skills stuff himself not too hard though and can be fairly interesting at time
6345,Jeff  Kurtz,if he is still teaching his of the civil rights please take it one of the best classes denison has to offer
6346,Jeff  Kurtz,i took dr civil rights rhetoric course a few years ago and i am still recommending some of his course texts class was always eventful and challenging and focused in a weird fun sort of way he is also invested in his students and fully encouraging
6347,Jeff  Kurtz,public speaking very easy helpful and clear one tip pick controversial subjects for speeches
6348,Jeff  Kurtz,very helpful also very intelligent
6349,Jeff  Kurtz,be prepared to work it was a pretty good class though
6350,Tim  Gongaware,dr g is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well he really cares about his job and it shows i would recommend taking him if you have the chance we had exams all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class
6351,Tim  Gongaware,dr g is fantastic he makes you feel validated and respected as a student he never talks down to anyone he keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible still theory and tries to engage students in the discussion you can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students take him
6352,Tim  Gongaware,dr g is hilarious he likes to tell personal stories which helps you remember the material the lectures can get long and boring but because the class is an hour and a half there are only three exams total all of which are online there are also two projects the only downfall to this is that you lose more than points for an a
6353,Tim  Gongaware,although the lectures get long i found the content boring rather than the professor i loved having him he made things personal with stories which helped me remember certain info and why things happened the way they did critical to sociology he thrives off of bantering with students and their participation would definitely recommend
6354,Tim  Gongaware,i find that the lectures get boring but gongaware is hilarious you have exams which are all online and projects which are pretty easy not a hard grader and i never read the book but do well on the tests would recommend if looking for a class to fulfill gen eds
6355,Tim  Gongaware,dr g is the man i took this course online over jterm but he was still very helpful read the instructions and do exactly what he is asking for and it is an easy a
6356,Tim  Gongaware,professor gongaware is a cool professor really funny and will always listen to you although the course starts out rough definitely get the flow of it
6357,Tim  Gongaware,dr g does an excellent job of making students feel validated and important to lectures allowed lecture to get derailed from time to time simply because we had a strong interest in a topic and he enjoyed seeing us work with the material great use of examples and ask you for too much you get out what you put into this class
6358,Tim  Gongaware,great teacher when it comes to keeping lectures interesting and engaging if you have questions he is easily approachable and will do his best to answer the question
6359,Tim  Gongaware,take his soc class i loved going to his classes most days he told stories that made this class great
6360,Tim  Gongaware,there is three exams all online and two one page single spaced papers i read the book once or any of the assigned readings and did just fine you do need to study for the exams but if you take notes you should be fine he can get sidetracked and sometimes the lectures that engaging
6361,Tim  Gongaware,dr gongaware was a very good professor his tests are all online and only two one page papers lectures can get long and boring but some of the material is interesting just do the review guides and be fine
6362,Tim  Gongaware,a fantastic professor i looking forward to soc theory at all and with dr g it quickly became my favorite class of the semester he is passionate sociology and wants to see his students succeed he treats you like adults and gives it to you straight great guy would take him again and recommend him without a doubt
6363,Tim  Gongaware,not hard what you are supposed to do for projects may seem difficult but as long as you just cover exactly what it says in the directions get on them tests are online recommend reading the chapter only before test do not need to otherwise super approachable and very understanding class can be boring but worth going take him
6364,Tim  Gongaware,he was a nice guy but not my favorite professor his tests were online but i never felt like i had enough time his expectations on assignments were unclear which made it difficult to get an a
6365,Tim  Gongaware,this class too bad his tests can be a bit tricky but they are all online which is nice i would not recommend procrastinating on the projects they are not hard but they can be time consuming he tends to go off on weird tangents so sometimes we only get through slides in class but overall he is fairly entertaining recommend him
6366,Tim  Gongaware,dr g is a very funny and approachable guy he is interesting in his lecture but it is very hard to follow what he is saying sometimes he is kind of scattered in his lecture and it is hard to remember everything from lecture sometimes you find the book more interesting than his lectures
6367,Tim  Gongaware,dr gongaware is a really nice and funny guy swears a lot which can be entertaining however his lectures drag on forever and seem scatterbrained at times no offense to him but i learned more from reading the textbook than listening in class i found him hard to pay attention to a lot of the time and he can be unclear about assignments
6368,Tim  Gongaware,awesome guy very easy to listen to drops quite a few which always spices the discussion up tests are online and papers bad take him if you can
6369,Tim  Gongaware,he was so awesome and funny he really opened my eyes to sociology and how incredibly interesting it is he has an awesome sense of humor and is a very real guy he class is really easy and he never takes attendance definitely take him for soc
6370,Theodore  Evergates,i thoroughly enjoyed dr evergates while gentle of voice and speech he packs a punch very entertaining very informative loved the narrative style of his lecturing speaking as a nontraditional student i think he is one of the most respectful and decent professors on campus
6371,Theodore  Evergates,i had dr evergates for senior seminar simply put this man is excellent he is so knowledgeable in his field and others is always willing to help and took our papers and made them into something amazing he is one of the best the college has
6372,Theodore  Evergates,very nice mean who is an easy grader if you do your work probably easiest seminar class except for class sometimes hard to hear and can be boring
6373,Theodore  Evergates,amazing professor really soft spoken so hard to hear at times but he is extremely knowledgeable and is always willing to help he re sparked an old interest for me
6374,Theodore  Evergates,nice guy hard to hear will help if you need it
6375,Theodore  Evergates,really intelligent and softspoken always wants the best for his students and tries very hard to accomodate
6376,Theodore  Evergates,if you pay attention his class is really easy especially quizzes in lecture he gives u vocab gives the def and then on the asks for or specific ones and he only wants or sent
6377,Theodore  Evergates,good teacher kinda boring at times but nice guy
6378,Theodore  Evergates,sit in front to hear him
6379,Theodore  Evergates,speaks very softly
6380,Mitchell  Snay,i took several of mitchell snays courses in and and still remember many of his lectures hands down the best teacher i had in my life challenging and passionate he made my love of history endure
6381,Mitchell  Snay,a hard grader i got a b yet one of the best professors i have ever studied with at denison expect to read a lot but the workload is still manageable his lectures were really good and enjoyable provided you read the textbooks
6382,Mitchell  Snay,a hard grader and ok teacher
6383,Mitchell  Snay,i love dr snay and his class is great my only complaint is that his assessments are incredibly picky most of the stuff you need to know will be oneliners from the book that you would probably not give a second glance to so be super careful he loves history and teaching but i think he forgets that not all of us can be walking encyclopedias
6384,Mitchell  Snay,love him
6385,Mitchell  Snay,favorite teacher at denison he is so passionate and the class goes by so fast while he expects a lot he makes you want to do well definitely take him if you have the option
6386,Mitchell  Snay,he loves history his passion makes you pay attention in class i find that he assigns way to much reading we use three textbooks on a regular basis and will read a chapter from each throughout the week he expects you to do your work and all of your work so if you tests will be a challenge work is managable really helpful
6387,Mitchell  Snay,incredibly challenging very passionate and expects a great deal from his students not coincidentally he is one of the best teachers ever met
6388,Mitchell  Snay,favorite teacher on campus challenging but fair his high opinion is motivating to do your best work by far the best class taken at denison was antislavery really intelligent approachable helpful had us to his house for dinner love mitch
6389,Mitchell  Snay,prof snay is a very good teacher reading is managable but he is a hard grader
6390,Mitchell  Snay,great prof very hard but definitly makes the material seem more interesting
6391,Mitchell  Snay,best professor on campus
6392,Mitchell  Snay,one of the best profs really expects a lot out of the students and is stingy on grading but you will come out of the class feeling as if you really learned something
6393,Mitchell  Snay,awesome prof class is difficult but he is so willing to help out he has a lot of respect for the students as long as you do the work one of my fave profs on campus
6394,Mitchell  Snay,not easy but a great class and an awesome and genuine professor

6403,Julia  Jasken,dr jasken is one of my favorite professors at mcdaniel she definitely cares about her students wants them to succeed she expects a lot as far as class work goes but work that is worthwhile can be applied in the real worldnot just silly reading assignments here and there i wish i taken more classes with her great
6404,Julia  Jasken,jasken is by far one of my favorite professors at mcdaniel is a great teacher is fun engaging and understanding i never felt that class was a waste of time and the class material was relevant and applicable i would highly recommend taking a class with herespecially the editing and desktop publishing class
6405,Julia  Jasken,dr jasken is my alltime fave professor at mcdaniel she treats her students with respect and is always willing to help you learn i have taken many classes with her and everyone just loves her she is wonderful
6406,Julia  Jasken,dr jasken was very nice and helpful but the class was pretty difficult since the class was required i definitely recommend her as the teacher
6407,Julia  Jasken,very nice engaging etc but her class activities are a little too squishy to be relevant to the subject matter i know why this was a class also teaching outdated technology not entirely fault but she clearly up on current standards
6408,Julia  Jasken,she is awesome this is truly one of the only classes i have enjoyed the class and assignments are engaging and as challenging as you want them to be i found her to be very helpful i was not familiar a lot of the computer programs she was always there to help she is also very talented
6409,Julia  Jasken,shes helpful and fun but i wouldnt take the class again
6410,Julia  Jasken,started out easy then turned on full blast so not a good class teaches like you are in grade helps only certain english major students avoid this class
6411,Julia  Jasken,a little too easy more of a high school teacher and not like a college professor but i guess what you should expect from an english class

6415,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,a prof actress and teaches acting hello people if you a theatre then take her courses if you are then you must take her will get great value from her knowledge and experience she tells you from the beginning that this is not easy and it this is serious work and evdb is a great teacher
6416,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,evdeebs incredible she has scared people out of theatre before but she just wants to make sure you the student really want to train and really want to get better as an actor she is wonderful and i love getting a beer with her great teacher
6417,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,she is an extremely hard grader she gives out the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and sticks to it pretty well she remind you when things are due just expects you to know her classes are fun and interesting if you like acting and theatre take her class if you are not a serious actor
6418,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,a professor who obviously loves her craft but necessarily be teaching it to others
6419,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,elizabeth takes every person as a serious actor who wishes to pursue this as a life goal also is very unorganized with homework little to no warning about work only a to take if you are in love with acting and plan on being an acting based theater major
6420,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,challenging insightful comments that help you to grow as an actor can be a bit wacky at times but not really a bad thing in an acting class after all do not complain about warm ups
6421,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,i had her as a teacher yet but she is my director for the fall play and she is fantastic
6422,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,a great teacher and she really gets inside of your head i loved the class
6423,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,great class expect to work you ass off though one of the only class you prob wont fall asleep in she has a lot of energy dont bring your cell but great class
6424,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,i love elizabeth her lectures are so interesting she keeps you on her toes she expects your best but is understanding when you can only give her less than your best you should def take this class it is awesome
6425,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,a lot of work for the class do not recommend if not a the student already
6426,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,who are you people this broad is crazy biased and drives people away from theatre she once told an advising student she should drop out of college because she was a bad actress sure she knows her stuff but overshadowed by her
6427,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,whoa hard work but really interesting and fun makes hu blar interesting and i got to know people in this class really well good for both actors and nonactors a non since i learned about myself as well thanks elizabeth
6428,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,elizabeth one of the best professors on this campus i highly reccomend her freshman seminar course acting with her will teach you a lot about yourself she knows lots about you from the first moment you walk in stay on top of all of your work if you it will bite you in the butt later
6429,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,no comments
6430,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,uber fun class elizabeth is great really crazy and great great class to take even if never tried acting before variety of work assignments
6431,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,know anything about theatre before this class easy no acting fun learned alot work but easy highly recomend for a global perspective
6432,Elizabeth  Van Den Berg,wacky lady a lot of work for a level class
6433,Wendy  Walters,awesome teacher one of the funniest teachers ever had assigns a lot of reading but not an overwhelming amount definately try to take her class
6434,Wendy  Walters,the good news wendy is smart and witty the bad news she knows it at first you laugh along with her and then you realize how condescending being she has no respect for risd and insults it all the time
6435,Wendy  Walters,no comments
6436,Wendy  Walters,wendy is one of the vew professors at risd who is confidently at the top of her field and whose work and teaching are maintaining the muchhyped and currently somewhat fragile reputation
6437,Wendy  Walters,wendy is awesome everyone should take a class with wendy walters she will change your life
6438,Wendy  Walters,her classes are hard but she is very helpfull and you will learn a lot she is a brillant teacher i found my favorite author via her advice
6439,Wendy  Walters,wendy really got me inspired i took the poetry class not expecting much thinking ot just blow off another credits and i ended up loving poetry loving the work i produced for her and how it improved and having a bit of a crush on her she is sh
6440,Wendy  Walters,difficult readings alot of discussion has alot of sense of humor is willing to help and laugh with you in all situations and all problems i love wendy awesome a great teacher
6441,Wendy  Walters,she was very strict when it came to class attendance she made us write a lot of papers the course material was not interesting we read long uninteresting articles rather than novels the articles were in depth and complex make you work hard but that hard a grader
6442,Wendy  Walters,funny as no other but the feedback from her is negative she has lots of things to teach but she force feeds it down the throut in an unpleasant manner exept when she relates the subject to food
6443,Wendy  Walters,every conversation turned into some kindof race speech about how the african americans suffered got pretty annoying and i dont think i learned very much she is nice but eh
6444,Wendy  Walters,was one of my friendliest teachers and i learned a lot
6445,Deb  Coolidge,this professor teach how to use materials i recommend watching youtube videos to master materials because one will not learn technique from the professor she gives a lot of pointless lectures too class time is not used well and can be boring she is very spacy but has a kind and enjoyable personality a good ta saves the day
6446,Deb  Coolidge,terrible
6447,Deb  Coolidge,i really enjoyed the assignments and the structure very spacey while her feedback was decent i got a lot more techniques and whatnot from my peers so your experience with her may depend on your section also find and befriend shane he will help you every freshman should do this
6448,Deb  Coolidge,assignments great teacher not so great always spaced out absentminded and very vague breaks project a lot never let her touch ur project her assignments are interesting to do but she give u any advice very idoriented class which i enjoy that much
6449,Deb  Coolidge,deb is awesome her projects were really tough but she inspired me to forge ahead and i changed my major from painting to id mostly because of her she is patient and easy to talk to and always has time for students on an individal basis if you get her you are lucky
6450,Deb  Coolidge,deb was great she gave us fun assignments and was always enthusiastic sometimes her expectations were not always clear but she knows when effort is put into a project and she takes note of it the final project was a blast too just remember to make the pojects your own
6451,Deb  Coolidge,pretty good assignments the course is laid out well crits are kind of unhelpful and sometimes make sense she is extremely nice however and is very lenient with project definitely a good introduction to have fun hard to go wrong if you put time and thought into your work
6452,Deb  Coolidge,very sweet a little absent minded sometimes but to a minimal degree without too much interference to her teaching her critiques were nice because she could usually point out a projects merits but balance it with constructive criticism enjoy her class if you enjoy a lot creative freedom
6453,Deb  Coolidge,she gives you a grade based on your effort craftsmanship is first then design and materials play some part too which is bad for you because the cost of materials link to the quality she buys some supplies so if frugal you can get away with spending she tries to help and talks a lot with demos but it ends up boring students
6454,Deb  Coolidge,i have very few words to describe deb you have to have a class with her to know her degree of spaciness some of us wonder whether she came to class stoned i tried my hardest and did well but not sure what i learned in the class the sleds were very fun to make though
6455,Deb  Coolidge,her assignments were lame and she barely held our interest also she got highly frustrated if any of us tried to enjoy being in studio for eight hours the sled project was tons of fun but she just threw it at us without any introduction to woodworking and expected us to make fine quality sleds
6456,Deb  Coolidge,i enjoyed this class even though is not my forte we had some fun projects teapots egg beating project sled very helpful if you ask for it but not going to hold your hand the whole way through if you satisfied with a project ust tell her and show her how hard you worked and take that into consideration
6457,Deb  Coolidge,deb is just flaky more so than other teachers she likes poetic explanations but mostly her own and it is tough to convince her of other ideas one day we had a tea party for the entire morning however she actually does pay attention to the level of craftsmanship and will reward effort more than you think gets really pissed when kids slack off
6458,Deb  Coolidge,just even think about how much money you spend to sit in one class or you make it nice semiinteresting projects but she is hard to read and give much helpful feedback overall not so good
6459,Deb  Coolidge,i try not to think about her i yelled at her a couple of times and she wrote that i have angermanagment issues people that know me know it true but in her class
6460,Deb  Coolidge,not a very good teacher but i enjoyed her assignments at least use the assignments as opportunities to push yourself show good craftmanship and you should enjoy the class and do well
6461,Deb  Coolidge,communication is not her forte so be surprised if when you get your comment sheet back after the semester is over that she mentiona things that are completely new to you
6462,Deb  Coolidge,blah this girl say a damn thing just nods yes or no her assignments can be really friggin cool though but you retain anything from her only from working yourself
6463,Deb  Coolidge,extremely boring projects not very knowlegeable give much feedback or says fine and then grades tough seems to like more traditional things
6464,Deb  Coolidge,she doesnt know what shes doing
6465,Pamela  Jackson,unless you are going into a class that she teaches knowing all the material like you have your phd in the subject expect to struggle lots of grades which is helpful but grading based on its what she wants to answer to be in her opinion ta is just like her very rude and makes you feel dumb
6466,Pamela  Jackson,i am currently in her class she is not helpful is impatient with questions arrogant and basically expects you to know spss zscores ttest prior to being in her class she does not go over new concepts her homework is very hard no time on class to go over it and balks at questions two words extra credit she is arrogant and rude
6467,Pamela  Jackson,she a bad professor but definitely give a lot of work
6468,Pamela  Jackson,dr jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap she was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question do whatever you can to avoid this lady
6469,Pamela  Jackson,was helpful during class in office hours was snippy and rude makes you feel bad for asking lots of assignments at one time and takes a while to get grades back
6470,Pamela  Jackson,love dr jackson if you need to take take it with her great teacher
6471,Pamela  Jackson,jackson is the most convoluted teacher i have experienced thus far she contradicts the book and herself on a regular basis her instructions are never clear when you ask for help she is snide and rude not the most difficult material but she makes it unbearable she also is never timely on grades
6472,Pamela  Jackson,dr jackson means well but this is the most annoying class i have taken at ru thus far we are constantly using spss and unless you are fortunate and have it on your own personal computer you will spend a lot of time on campus using those computers for homework the lab section of this class is just a study block essentially avoid if possible
6473,Pamela  Jackson,the material for the class is hard but dr jackson is super helpful and knowledgeable she does everything in her power to help you out would definitely recommend her
6474,Pamela  Jackson,dr jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap she was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question do whatever you can to avoid this lady
6475,Pamela  Jackson,hard class but dr jackson is always willing to help out if needed extremely clear offers plenty of extra credit attendance is not mandatory but you can receive up to extra points on tests just for going to class nice lady would definitely recommend
6476,Pamela  Jackson,most influential professor teaching research she makes you try in order to pass her class and by doing that you gain so much knowledge definitely take her if you wish to pursue a career dealing with psychological research love her
6477,Pamela  Jackson,continued from below but points are given for each day i failed this class with another teacher and ended up with a with dr jackson take her for psyc201 and so easy and very helpful gives lots of extra credit
6478,Pamela  Jackson,dr jacksons class is so simple everything and i mean everything on come straight from lecture notes tests but the first are part online and part essay and the essays she gives you to study before the exams the other exams are part take home and part essay as well and so simple attendance not mandatory but points a
6479,Pamela  Jackson,class turned out to be way better than i expected there were tough but she is such a nice lady and is always willing to help out students i am definitely taking her again for psyc
6480,Pamela  Jackson,this is the worst class i have ever had in my life made me cry never want to return to school etc if you feel like wanting to hang yourself by the middle of the year then by all means sign up for this course
6481,Pamela  Jackson,she is the worst professor i have ever had period avoid this woman at all costs take dr willner
6482,Pamela  Jackson,no comments
6483,Pamela  Jackson,she is very unorganized forgets what she is teaching sometimes looks confused i really dont like her teaching style because she doenst teach she expects a whole lot that is expected a class she is out of her mind she really be a teacher she is nice but doesnt teach well at all dont take her
6484,Pamela  Jackson,she was probably the worst psych teacher i ever had i had signed up for someone else but she wound up teaching instead i almost failed that class and my last years of school i only made like c in all my classes she sucks
6485,Michael  McGee,i really liked this class i thought the class got easier as it went on he goes over exactly whats going to be on the test the class before also he randomly takes attendance for extra credit and it can really help your grade points the paper is extremely easy definitely reccomend
6486,Michael  McGee,mr mcgee is so straightforward he gives you all the notes beforehand you barely have to write anything down i never went but studied for every test and i got an a in the class the book project is kind of tedious but not bad once you consider a great professor but whatever you do take this class at a.m.you will fall go
6487,Michael  McGee,class is really boring but hes nice he gives a study guide for tests and theyre just like the test i never went to class just studied the study guide and went on review days got an a taking him again this semester
6488,Michael  McGee,awesome teacher had him for a couple of classes really good teacher
6489,Michael  McGee,horrible teacher he uses his personal opinion over the text information on tests buy the book you need it attendance isnt mandatory so bother going rude and has a very negative outlook on life the very first day of class he let us know that of us would be divorced just ruude
6490,Michael  McGee,a nice guy the class was very boring and made sure to keep us to the last second he does a review the class before each test just take notes that class and study them and do fine on the tests
6491,Michael  McGee,class is pretty easy gives extra credit when he takes attendance lectures are decent
6492,Michael  McGee,easy teacher but expect to really get anything out of the class he could make jokes but i found him to be disorganized and arrogant ask to see him after class he complains constantly about how he has no time
6493,Michael  McGee,very easy class he emails all the notes and the tests are all multiple choice he make class very interesting but it is an easy a
6494,Michael  McGee,great guy very disorganized at times but his humor tries to make up for it gives great study reviews for exams highly recommended
6495,Michael  McGee,very easy i never went to class and i made an a he emails the notes and reviews to you so you never have to go to class tests are straight from the notes
6496,Michael  McGee,best teache i had at ru
6497,Michael  McGee,slack tests are question multiple choice the notes are emailed and all you have to do is take a few notes on what he says here and there like stories or examples cool easy a
6498,Michael  McGee,i really enjoyed this class he is a great professor should teach more classes emails notes and gives an awsome test review makes class interesting and fun i really like him and would def recommend him to anyone
6499,Michael  McGee,a good professor and makes note taking really easy cuz he emails all the notes all u have do in class is listen and the tests use the website he gives cuz the questions come straight from there go class every friday cuz he takes attendance
6500,Michael  McGee,he is so awesome funny and cute explains all the course material very interesting
6501,Michael  McGee,test was pretty easy.go everyday bc he takes attendance randomly and gives you extra credit the class before the test he gives you a review write these things down pretty much word for word from the exam.for the paper go to him and get your article cleared in advance and you will be ok
6502,Michael  McGee,an ok professor tests are ridiculously easy class was really boring to sit through he just reads the notes attendance is extra credit you have to write a paper but he gives an example paper easy he is incredibly patronizing at times makes you feel stupid for asking questions
6503,Michael  McGee,love mr mcgee one of the best professors ever had an extremely nice guy makes class fun knows his material will never turn you down for help etc had him for classes and done well in both a great professor overall
6504,Michael  McGee,my favorite class and professor at ru so far he adds humor to his lectures to make it interesting majority of the test info is from the notes but some from the book gives extra credit for attendance on random days so just go to classit helps a lot
6505,Tony  Caporale,really hard class it takes a gifted teacher to make macro interesting tony is not one of these gifted teachers
6506,Tony  Caporale,economics is a tough field for me and i really struggled in this class i met with him during office hours and he able to offer me any advice i spent on a tutor and i still do well i got a which i consider bad for the amount of work i put into the class he also made a mistake and recorded my grade as an f and i had to go through tons of paperwork to get it changed avoid this teacher
6507,Tony  Caporale,caporale is a good teacher and he is very clear on what he wants from you he makes sure he explains things thoroughly and is very helpful his tests are hard if you a good studier take this class
6508,Tony  Caporale,really enthusiastic about economics but i found that what he taught really reflect what was on the midterms reading the book is all that really matters because when it came to the tests my notes were pretty much useless
6509,Tony  Caporale,tony is such a cute professor he sort of reminds me of a turtle but i want to diss him because really enthusiastic about economics i think econ is very interesting but his lectures go really fast and usually get out early i still like econ a lot but glad he was my professor he also gives extra credit assignments
6510,Tony  Caporale,oh brother i can see this guy being like tony montana at home he explains everything clearly but the tests are pretty difficult for someone who really get economics but i rarely paid attention in class use the textbook listen in class and take notes and i bet this class be too hard
6511,Tony  Caporale,a cute little dude and crazy about economics the first test was really easy but the last few got pretty difficult i felt like the notes really relate to the exams but he does offer some helpful preexams on line
6512,Tony  Caporale,very enthusiastic about the topic go to class as much as you can and you will do fine
6513,Tony  Caporale,enthusiastic about the material and a fairly nice guy but the tests are much tougher than the class suggests and the inclass notes help much the notes are basically nothing but graphs and just breeze through the details you need to know need to read the book to do well
6514,Tony  Caporale,not an easy class but if you go everyday and take notes then you will do just fine caporale is excited about the subject but he really make it any more interesting for the students
6515,Tony  Caporale,his econ class was easy as pie i never went and got an a his economics of sports class is pretty easy i never went and got an a
6516,Tony  Caporale,caporale is an absolute jerk do not take his class bc he cant teach the material at all if you ask for help then he is rude to you the tests suck and i had to teach myself the whole class
6517,Tony  Caporale,i rarely went to class and still got a b im not even good at econ the times i did go it was very boring and hard to pay attention exams and final make up the final grade and all exams are multiple choice i would suggest taking the online quizzes most exam questions are very simalar to the online quizzes
6518,Tony  Caporale,i had a lot of trouble learning the material in the class i had to teach myself just not the kind of professor i like his tests are pretty hard too but if you never go to the completely and do well on the test go for it your guy
6519,Tony  Caporale,does not teach you have to learn everything by yourself the tests are impossible has no control over the class people just leave and come the whole class so annoying not very clear in explaining concepts all he does is draw graphs and expects you to understand them
6520,Tony  Caporale,talks very fast and teaches right off of the powerpoints from the website if you read the powerpoints and do practice problems from the book you should be okay so if you like going to class but like getting grades this is the class to take
6521,Tony  Caporale,dr caporale gives interesting lectures but as far as material and tests are concerned the book is a very helpful resource studying is essential for the multiple choice exams which can be difficult
6522,Tony  Caporale,read from book most of this class could be articulated as effectively through independent study after the first test i stopped attending class i recieved an a overall felt like a waste of money
6523,Tony  Caporale,tests are difficult study a lot multiple choice format as for the class a bit boring as for the teacher also a bit boring not a great class but not horrible
6524,Tony  Caporale,taught in a big lecture hall and he talks kinda fast so you cant really zone out but no homework and he did lots of practice problems to make things simple really animated
6525,Peter  Pezzolo,great nice lectures alongside films related to the class take home midterm and final with some hw assignments inbetween he make your semester a living hell and learn a lot from his lectures and just speaking to him in general
6526,Peter  Pezzolo,straightforward clear provides good lectures alongside films relating to the subject matter show up to class sign in listen and learn no tests no homework take home midterm and final papers as well as attendance your grade for this class pezzolo is pure class
6527,Peter  Pezzolo,hot professor went to yale and he is a lawyer would definitely take and yes even if he talks that kean is the worst it is true
6528,Peter  Pezzolo,if you want an easy a than take him nothing has anything to do with the course that he goes over all he does is throw temper tantrums about how kean sucks and we watch movies all the time show up to class do other homework he does not care
6529,Peter  Pezzolo,all he does is talk about how much he hates the administration
6530,Peter  Pezzolo,i am being very honest and speak with concern he is showing symptoms of senility he forgets things he has said minutes ago kids show up and leave within the first hour last week it was just me and other dude in class left at the end of the lecture i leave because i genuinely feel bad and surprised that he notice
6531,Peter  Pezzolo,he put question marks all over my midterm paper do not need the book final was so hard attendance counts walk in and leave he lectures for to long
6532,Peter  Pezzolo,easy a take home midterm and final easy essay question you can just google
6533,Peter  Pezzolo,take someone else if possible hes confused ididnt gt him hard to understand
6534,Peter  Pezzolo,good professor knows what talking about make you think deeper into the subject if you actually come to class attendance was never mandatory he specifically says show up to class regularly so half the semester is enough come in sign in leave just do the papers make sure you answer all of the questions pass
6535,Peter  Pezzolo,first time with this professor and i thought he was easy technically you can miss class times for attendance participation much just a midterm and final watch a lot of movies in class complains about kean a lot easy a
6536,Peter  Pezzolo,i had dr pezzelo for justice and human rights he is amazing great guy he cares about his students take home midterm and final essays really easy.very interesting class you like hist and politics.you watch movies and discussions after got an a great class
6537,Peter  Pezzolo,honestly i took this course because it was easy but i was also hoping to learn something too get me wrong you do learn basic concepts such as being honest and how humans take things for granted but what im criticizing is the way he teaches it is frustrating all he does is complain about people and kean complains but gives no solutions
6538,Peter  Pezzolo,he is so intelligent and his lectures are very interesting all classes should be like his where you actually leave the class with knowledge about the topic and a different way of thinking
6539,Peter  Pezzolo,he is very intellgent and passionate sometimes he rambles but that is only because he really loves what he teaches i enjoyed this class alot of work and it really made me think what school should be about no never a dull moment with this guy
6540,Peter  Pezzolo,very easy class he takes attendance but claims it does not factor into grade only right assignments in the entire class a takehome midterm and takehome final only a few pages of writing required he generally lets the class out early as well very nice and easy to talk to a great choice for a free elective easy a
6541,Peter  Pezzolo,the textbooks that he says you need are not a requirement buy or rent them you can google a lot of the info or use library resources teachingwise very passionate and kind pretty funny too and a little eccentric which is always interesting the class is very easy movies every class really chill and intelligent easy a
6542,Peter  Pezzolo,i had pro pezzelo for justice and human rights he is amazing great guy who cares about his students take home midterm and final which is really easy if you take notes and utilize his office hours come to class sign in and leave whenever you want attendance is mandatory he shows alot of movies taking him for two classes next semester
6543,Peter  Pezzolo,great class must take professor really good at explaining the subject if u come to class you will have no problem writing the papers
6544,Peter  Pezzolo,yes this is a good class if you like to slack off you definitely have to come to every class he shows alot of movies i did go to every class and took notes which made it really easy to write the papers but you can just easily google the information too i enjoyed his class if you bother going you can learn some things
6545,Bob  Filson,mr filson is hands down the best instructor i have encountered at grcc he goes above and beyond his duty and comes to class earily often it is not a easy class but if you put in the hard work ask he is always glad and eager to answer and attend class you should do well and even if you dont you will learn to love his class
6546,Bob  Filson,dr filson is a wonderful professor i came away with an unexpected tremendous amount of knowledge about the earth a tough subject that he makes fun and interesting and pretty forgiving in his grading do the reading and study guides show up to class do well i highly recommend him and love to take another class of his
6547,Bob  Filson,mr filson is a very kind and understanding professor it is not the easiest class but if you work hard to understand what he is saying you will get a good grade before the tests he gives answers to the study guide which really helps understand what will be on the test i would love to take another one of his classes and highly recommend him
6548,Bob  Filson,an awesome teacher that really cares about you and your grade he is very clear with what is on the exam he even lets you drop an exam gives out fair amount of extra credit so getting a good grade in his class too difficult
6549,Bob  Filson,lectures were interesting and informative normally much of a person but found myself looking forward to class each day labs are awesome using tools real geologists do and learning things that are relevant in many other fields overall a great guy and always willing to work with students individually to ensure learning
6550,Bob  Filson,hands down my favorite instructor at green river went into the class not expecting much but turned out amazing he is extremely helpful and will go out of his way to help students lectures are informative and interesting very understanding of your mistakes and works with you to fix them teacher all around
6551,Bob  Filson,great teacher very nice and helpful all you have to do is follow the syllabus and study the rocks and you should do great in his class
6552,Bob  Filson,he is such a kind man he cares about his students and will help you if you ask he grades really easy and will give you a good grade if you try hard he makes it interesting and there is very little homework
6553,Bob  Filson,such a kind instructor long lectures but he keeps it interesting by asking questions using videos sometimes recent ones and explains how it applies to you as a student he always comes to class enthusiastic and ready to teach tests can be very long but if you study each chapter and take good notes during his lectures you will pass
6554,Bob  Filson,awesome teacher i really like to take his class as i am a international student many terms i understand and he just explain these terms in easy way and help me a lot but the rock part is really hard
6555,Bob  Filson,taken three of classes he is very easy to understand and make the subject matter interesting he is always willing to answer questions he is very clear on what will students will be tested on and provides handouts for guide purposes
6556,Bob  Filson,very good
6557,Bob  Filson,filson is great humorous and friendly he is incredibly helpful and smart has a phd in the subject he seems to understand that students take this intro class simply as a requirement so he emphasizes learning general ideas rather than minute details that will be forgotten by anyone not a geology major
6558,Bob  Filson,my favorite teacher so far he made geology fun and interesting and helped you anytime you needed it field trips were easy very fun class
6559,Bob  Filson,excellent instructor very helpful and interesting if you put some effort into the class ie attend do the homework do fine he wants people to do well if you are a slacker be prepared to be stressed with the workload i also recommend the fieldtrips class for an activity credit it gives a new appreciation of geology
6560,Bob  Filson,bob is kinda cool for a older guy his class too hard if you go not the most fun class in the world but i definantly understand the earth a bit more really loves his subject
6561,Bob  Filson,while i profess any real interest in geology i appreciated this passion you will learn alot despite your best efforts the perfect model of what a good teacher can accomplish he really sets the bar high for his coworkers
6562,Bob  Filson,i have never been that interested in science but bob filson was one of my favorite professors he made the class fun and his lectures were actually interesting the tests were hard but easy to make up for in other areas i am totally amazed thinking back on how much i learned from his class i actually looked forward to it every day
6563,Bob  Filson,this guy is a great teacher with extreme passion he cares very much about you learning something his explaining ability is a top notch complex and incricate concepts come to be easily grasped after his explanations definetly recommended
6564,Bob  Filson,i hate him it was a hard class so if you are not a slacker and like geology then this is the right class otherwise find an easier science class and more interesting teacher to fill your credits
6565,Joyce  Hammer,great instructor genuinely wants to help her students succeed if you needed help outside of class always took the time to make sure you understood recommended
6566,Joyce  Hammer,didnt like her style at all too vague has favorites and pretty cheesy
6567,Joyce  Hammer,she succeeded at getting me past my math fears where many others had failed miserably a very warm very motherly way about her a hottie too but alas is very married with two kids
6568,Joyce  Hammer,great teacher very smart and entertaining
6569,Bob  Teti,very good professor helpful and funny at the same time make sure you take all test and the final try your best and everything will work out in the end promise take bob
6570,Bob  Teti,bob is fabulous he helps people when they need help if you are worried he will reassure you that everything will all work out in the end he teaches you not to give up on yourself and to remember that you can do this work all you have got to do is try and take bob
6571,Bob  Teti,bob is great at what he does i would ask him questions after class and seemed to get better feedback from him he was always reachable by cell phone or email and always kept communication open it is hard to maintain an a because there is no extra credit and your grade is based solely on exams stay on top of work and practice problems
6572,Bob  Teti,he is mean does not give extra credit or give any credit for homework your grade depends on three exams and the final exam its hard to pass if you arent already fluent in algebra he doesnt explain much he gets mad when we ask him to go over problems many students in my class dropped the course.i recommend this teache
6573,Bob  Teti,by far the best math teacher i ever had took this class in spring and failed so i decided to take it again in summer everyone said not to because it would be harder and passed with flying colors he made the work so understandable if you had questions he would help you he went over everything and the text he used was cheap deff recommend
6574,Bob  Teti,lighthearted and fun he makes math interesting he tends to go too fast thru some problems you have to ask him to explain it or slow down only tests add them up and divide by your grade the tests are fully comprehensive however he give very difficult problems this class blew my gpa and i still recommend him
6575,Bob  Teti,a great teacher.he take his time to explain the work his test are stree free and so i his class reconmend u take him.and he give you credit if ur ans is a little bit incorrect
6576,Bob  Teti,bob is the best teacher for math i dont like math but he made it fun and easy to understand would definitly recommend taking him the tests come write out of the textbook he will stay after class if you need help
6577,Bob  Teti,bob teti is a great teacher he is very easy to understand and if you need help he will stay after class to help you he make math fun and easy he goes over the homework in class and if you have any questions he will go over it even if he teached it would definitly recommend his class
6578,Bob  Teti,bob teti was a very good teacher he explained the topic his notes really help you on the test and he tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests homework is not mandatory but he will about the homework would highly recommend taking him for math
6579,Bob  Teti,mr teti is one of the best teachers period i wish he taught everything cool easy going kind helpful great at explaining the work and this helps you get it just all around great oh and the work was modest and exams pretty easy and im no math geek take him over the others
6580,Bob  Teti,this guy could cut class with his adonis like stature if you know what i am saying good teacher very clear with instructions and just as helpful i took two exams and did my homework homework is not graded but it will help you in the long run hardest nips this side of the mississippi
6581,Bob  Teti,first let me state that i hate math bob however was the best math teacher i ever had he moves fast and writes a lot of notes but i got it it is the way he explains it and if anyone get it he always would spend time after class explaining it until we did get it great teacher
6582,Bob  Teti,there was an awful lot of him writing on the board copying problems that took up alot of time i thought he was a bit arrogant the only reason i got a c was because i went to a tutoring class with an awesome russian woman whose name i forget i would not take this professor again
6583,Bob  Teti,awesome luved his class
6584,Bob  Teti,great professor show up listen and study the work he is young at heart and very fun makes math interesting
6585,Bob  Teti,best math teacher i ever had highly recommend his class i would take him for every math class if i could
6586,Bob  Teti,mr.teti is a great teacher he comes to class ready to teach and will do all he can to make sure you understand the work
6587,Bob  Teti,he rocks bob really takes the stress out of learning math focused on not making things hard for you so that you can get to math as quickly as possible you get to keep the test questions so that if you fail he calls you with what you got wrong and you just bring your answers in i wish he taught everything
6588,Bob  Teti,great teacher explained everything clearly and always wrote examples on the board never got below a on any of his tests
6589,Shelia  Most,i took mythology with shelia and it was a difficult class she gives tests and a paper the tests cover a ton of material and are difficult to do well on we really discuss the reading only the but the tests were mostly on the reading very frustrating plan on studying weeks in advance to get it all
6590,Shelia  Most,do not take her it will be the best decision you ever make class is extremely boring all she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes you even have to read the books she assigns her teaching style is inexplicably flawed some aspects of this class are but you will regret taking this class with her
6591,Shelia  Most,very cool very funny and will always help you when you need it the class is boring for me since all we do is talk about the books reading but still very interesting to listen to at times a funny old lady
6592,Shelia  Most,i am a great student and and the most difficult time with her class she rambled on and on about nothing relevant her tests are ridiculously hard the class consists of tests a paper and attendance if you did poorly on assignment there was no hope for raising your grade do not take her
6593,Shelia  Most,she makes attendance mandatory when not at all also the coursepack you need for the class i only looked at it once or twice the whole semester read the books and know about the authors you will get an a bring other hw to this class or else you will fall asleep
6594,Shelia  Most,lets just say she is boring all she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes the class is based off of attendance three tests and two papers it was so hard not to fall asleep in the class if you have to take this class save yourself and do not take her
6595,Shelia  Most,great class some stuff on the test is from the lecture but not much i would listen to the back story and author bio but you either need to read the books or listen to the lecture not both exams are easy if you attention very nice but a little senile
6596,Shelia  Most,what i got was stories about grandchildren an old guy named levi and a bunch of other stories i could do without i had a declared male witch who talked throughout the class about anything from succesful spells to his druidic staff and the teacher let him talk as much as he wanted if you want a teacher as smart as the ones from high school
6597,Shelia  Most,read the books and do fine the background reading really even necessary very personable friendly i liked her
6598,Shelia  Most,very good just read the books and attend class and be golden
6599,Shelia  Most,she was nice wastes a lot of time in class though tests werent bad but you have to attend class because they are lecture based pretty easy grader
6600,Shelia  Most,her classes are heavily lecture based her classes are relatively mangable except the research paper she is very respectful and is willing to help you when you need it
6601,Shelia  Most,the class is interesting and easy sheila is a wonderful women and very sweet
6602,Shelia  Most,she is a bad teacher the class consists of tests and a paper on the tests she asks things like from the coursepack the article was published in what year who cares what year published and she is incredibly boring i seriously think she wrote all the nice comments about herself below this one no one can actually think good
6603,Shelia  Most,she is a very nice lady very approachable and personable her teaching style is all lecture with not much time or room for discussion she is very thourough if you go to class and take notes do fine i read most of the books and still got an a the term paper is alot of put it off till the last minute
6604,Shelia  Most,she is a great teacher while the class is mostly a prereq for most students she makes the class fun and enjoyable good teacher i would recommend her
6605,Shelia  Most,shes nice but really boring
6606,Shelia  Most,i simple adore this prof she is very easy to reach out of class and is helpful if you get stuck during an exam very funny and has study guides for the tests in the coursepack no final just tests
6607,Shelia  Most,professor most is the best she is such a wonderful person in class as well as outside of class she genuinely cares about her students and that something you see in a professor very often i highly recommend world mythology and taking multicult lit just cuz the prof
6608,Shelia  Most,she is one of the most detailed professors that taken she is concerned about students and their learning and she is willing to help in any way that she can taken her and she knows her stuff
6609,Pam  Pruett,thought you would do good because you aced composition and have had mostly and a b here and there throughout the semesters think again takes off lots of points for small errors and so far has assigned topics that i find very vague and hard to write about crossing my fingers that i can just pass and not lose my scholarship
6610,Pam  Pruett,mrs pruett is a great teacher but is extremely un forgiving when grading if you make minor mistakes in grammar or quite write a word structured essay in an hour in class without any preparation or have not so good writing style be prepared to struggle she is really nice and helpful but her class is extremely difficult
6611,Pam  Pruett,great teacher made a really boring book interesting
6612,Pam  Pruett,teacher was laid back and very helpful
6613,Pam  Pruett,i loved her she was the best teacher that ever had she got us to understand shakespeare and i guess she got me to love shakespeare i had her twice in high school for grade honors english and shakespeare class
6614,Pam  Pruett,hardest but best english teacher i ever had i whined along with everyone else when she graded us strictly but so glad i took her class and i learned a ton from it
6615,Pam  Pruett,no comments
6616,Pam  Pruett,ms pruett was the best teacher i ever had and i will always remember her
6617,Pam  Pruett,no comments
6618,Duane  Stock,great teacher and advise taking him he really helps out and the exams are a piece of cake if you study for them
6619,Duane  Stock,hard but fair
6620,Duane  Stock,no comments
6621,Duane  Stock,worst professor i have ever had of the exams are based on material that he breezed over in seconds the first week of school he use slides overall well i say it if i want this post to appear but i have never seen so many peop
6622,Rachel  Edelson,need to get sophomore english out of the way this class is a really great way to do it in weeks over the summer a lot less stress to write many short not style heavy papers over the traditional long paper have fun and get to meet others through interaction and discussion unlike the normal class
6623,Rachel  Edelson,by far the most interesting and engaging english class bordering on things like sociology and psychology the coursework is not structured in the sense that there are criteria that must be met rather you make your opinions anyway you see fit this allows for a lot of creativity and fun even as a science major i thoroughly enjoyed this professor
6624,Rachel  Edelson,professor e is such a sweetheart and will make you think outside the box her class is engaging and a real thought provoker i used to absolutely detest having to take english but she changed the way i feel about the subject you will leave the class with a new and improved sense of analyzing situations and a new sense in creative writing
6625,Rachel  Edelson,amazing the way she teaches is like learning with you and make you feel more comfortable and confident in learning you feel really involved in her class because we had daily class discussions about real interesting topics be prepared to write short easy pieces everyday but everything about this class helps and enjoy it
6626,Rachel  Edelson,mrs e is among the best teachers ever met english was for a long time my least favorite subject and prior to taking mrs e i was not looking forward to through another english however mrs class blew me away she covers some incredibly fascinating topics and she gives you free reign to explore them take her class
6627,Rachel  Edelson,ms e was truly one of my favorite professors of all time she really was able to make me think out of the box and fill my brain with knowledge about things that are never really spoken about as long as you do all your writing assignments every night which will be assigned every single night you will pass the class without any problems
6628,Rachel  Edelson,excellent teacher i would recommend this class to everyone attending sac city college other professors are boring trust me
6629,Rachel  Edelson,ms e as she is likely to have you call her is a teacher that embodies what in my opinion is the pinnacle of teaching by delving into material that is new unfamiliar or even beyond her current comprehension she challenges students to think deeply and holds herself to the same standard take her only if you desire to be challenged and grow
6630,Rachel  Edelson,she is an amazing teacher you will learn how to whip up a thoughtful essay in no time after this class she is very personal and honest one of my favorite and most memorable teachers ever experienced
6631,Rachel  Edelson,class was transformative she is real she genuinely cares about her students and there are no topics off limits from her class discussions be ready to grow as a human being if you take her class if you participate in discussions you will do well she is fair and understanding and does not grade harsh i loved her class
6632,Rachel  Edelson,echoing another review ms edelson takes her work seriously she spends a lot of time editing essays and helping her students develop their ideas she has an unimposing brilliance that inspired me to produce some of the best essays i have ever written i would recommend taking this class solely for the collage essay
6633,Rachel  Edelson,simply put if you have an opportunity to study with rachel edelson take that opportunity rachel is a deeply inspiring thinker and human being who takes personally the development of each one of her students when you speak in class and you will speak in class she listens attentively and remembers what you share even months or years later
6634,Rachel  Edelson,this is not your typical english class instead of dreary lectures we had riveting class discussions about shocking issues in place of monotonous grammar homework we had assignments that required opinion thought and action ms edelson has an unrivaled passion for teaching that is evident in her class without doubt i highly recommend her
6635,Rachel  Edelson,i cannot recommend rachel edelson more highly if you truly care about learning take her class i had the privilege of taking eng1a at scc while in high school and it saved me from absolute depression about school in marked contrast to the stultifying english classes at ckm edelson really engaged and supported our critical thinking and writing
6636,Rachel  Edelson,rachel edelson is easily the most engaging inspiring english teacher i ever studied with her classes easy because she respects students enough to truly challenge grapple with complex themes and reading material as with any great class get what you put into it so do yourself a favor and give it your all
6637,Rachel  Edelson,take this class
6638,Rachel  Edelson,this was one of my favorite courses edelson is an invaluable facilitator of education we begun the class by improving lexicon and even covered how the words one uses changes perception of one and also how one perceives the world there was never a dull moment never a time when i felt the mechanisms of my mind not being utilized
6639,Rachel  Edelson,i attended eng300 and eng302 at my high school the homework was always interesting which made it easier to respond to the best part about the class would have to be the discussions on the topics researched you really get a lot out what you put into it and if you struggle the discussion helps spark new ideas i highly recommend this class
6640,Rachel  Edelson,by supplying our class with heated topics to write about she made it to where we just writing brainless dry essays half of class is going over upcoming assignments addressing the concerns of the students and going over useful grammar and punctuation tips then we shared thoughts about the homework we wrote short papers a week
6641,Rachel  Edelson,two word essays due a week class starts by useful grammer tips the next hour she calls on every person to see how they feel about the topic for the essay the essay topics are mostly revolved around politics money and every once in awhile something interesting
6642,T  Farris,dr frarris is great he writes all the notes for you and posts them online he makes the tests easy to study for he is very helpful and will talk with you on any subject that clear
6643,T  Farris,i really liked dr f he explains things in class i agree with the person that said he kinda expects you to already know it he put all homework and quizzes online easy class if you can put enough effort into the online hw
6644,T  Farris,i thought his class was really hard the astronomy labs were really easy but i thought the tests were hard i took notes every day and read my book and still never made an a on a test
6645,T  Farris,overall he is a nice professor but if you like note taking he is the person to take his tests are pretty hard because he is not a visual person it seems like he just expects you to know it
6646,T  Farris,he is a great teacher he is willing to help you if you understand something and he is willing to explain things in different ways to help you understand he does talk monotone sometimes but get excitied as he goes through lessons highly recommended
6647,T  Farris,dr farris is very helpful with answering questions in class the tests are very easy as long as you go to class and take notes he grades fairly easy but his class is kinda boring if your not real interested in the topic being discussed
6648,T  Farris,no comments
6649,T  Farris,no comments
6650,T  Farris,very cool his labs are great but he actually said in class one day that he was so monotone that he was putting himself to sleep if you take his class learn as long as you are drinking a ton of coffee
6651,T  Farris,overall dr farris is good teacher he has a wealth of knowledge and is very fair he give every answer away and he promotes critical thinking if he is lacking in anything it would be his teaching style visual learners may not find his explanations perfectly clear
6652,T  Farris,dr farris is really smart and can answer just about anything you want to know about the universe he is nice and has a good sense of humor and his notes adequately prepare you for the tests his labs are usually very interesting
6653,Prakash  Panangaden,i understand why people love him but i have some reservations sometimes aggressively pick on the kid in our class ask too many questions fair enough but i think the kid had some social issues and although i appreciated he was honest he might have done more to discourage than encourage brilliant professor though teaches very well
6654,Prakash  Panangaden,best cs prof had at mcgill lectures are extremely clear and concise and prakash really cares about his students doing well he has stayed well past his office hours to help students in the past
6655,Prakash  Panangaden,very clear and efficient at teaching it took me some time to fully understand recursion but after i got it it was really easy just black magic final class average should be at least
6656,Prakash  Panangaden,he really has the right way to teach his presentation of the material is simply efficient i could understand everything the first time the assignments and exams implied more thinking than actual writing and were sometimes challenging but always rewarding
6657,Prakash  Panangaden,legit wizard people find comp hard because quite foreign but prakash is a wizard at teaching this stuff going to his class was an actual treat take any class that teaching about half the class was done the final within an hour
6658,Prakash  Panangaden,love him
6659,Prakash  Panangaden,best prof ever
6660,Prakash  Panangaden,take any class if prakash teaches it
6661,Prakash  Panangaden,very easy class skip class understand a
6662,Prakash  Panangaden,legend
6663,Prakash  Panangaden,prof get ready to spend all of your time on the homework assignments worth of the semester and are insanely tough tests are ok skimp out on the assignments
6664,Prakash  Panangaden,great teacher you should probably learn the material before taking the course very hard even for someone who knows programming
6665,Prakash  Panangaden,way too hard
6666,Prakash  Panangaden,a great lecturer passionate with what teaching really funny
6667,Prakash  Panangaden,great lectures very clear and consist however go see the tas if you have a question unless you are absolutely stuck if you ask him a question because confused get ready for a verbal thrashing
6668,Prakash  Panangaden,prakash is honestly very overrated loves to intimidate students and is extremely cocky and arrogant i went to him for help and all he did was spit in my face about how i need to pay more attention in class i obviously went to him because i understand his notes but he understand how anyone could not understand his amazing notes
6669,Prakash  Panangaden,loved this course prakash does a great job giving the material life through his dedication to getting the information across assignments were fair took some work but they were quite interesting and indicative of what to expect on tests one thingtrusting my interest in the course i barely studied for the final and lost a letter grade for it
6670,Prakash  Panangaden,amazing prof really cares about his students posts very detailed notes online to make sure everybody understands lectures are entertaining and funny assignments are very interesting exams are fair and the exam material is explicitly laid out beforehand he puts emphasis on the exactness of communications to avoid any ambiguity
6671,Prakash  Panangaden,what a wonderful professor and wonderful course he clearly tells you exactly what will be on the midtermfinal emphasizes the most important info in class and is a very fun prof he tries his best to learn name too i absolutely loved this class avg midtermfinal grades were high as well
6672,Prakash  Panangaden,great professor easy assignments and exams required very little studying but was still very interesting would highly recommend
6673,R  McCoy,professor mccoy is not the reason i had to withdraw from this class this class is not a class you want to take online my only issue was the labs they were hard to understand i would work on them for hours and think i knew what i was doing and then would fail them i suggest at least taking the lab in person if you take online classes
6674,R  McCoy,i decided to take this class on video because i needed to learn but not have to drive all the way to gallatin in this class you have to read and anwser questoins over chapters at a time crazy the labs were so hard and uncomprehensible i would not recomend anyone take this class on video because its just to confusing
6675,R  McCoy,really great teacher answers emails promptly will stay late to help you one of the best
6676,R  McCoy,very helpful will even stay after on exam days to help with labs that you didnt understand until you get finished
6677,C  Beals,take this class as long as you take notes and study you will pass chris is great at explaining things there are lecture tests and lab tests and he puts lots of info on elearn to help you study
6678,C  Beals,his class is very hard and an class for me so very hard for me to stay awake the whole semester is based on exam grades and your lab grade and the exams are very hard
6679,C  Beals,mr beals is an awesome teacher i wish he could teach all my other classes he will repeat and explain this as many times as needed also going to si is a big plus sandra the si teacher is fantastic and helps out soo much and mr beals gives you extra credit for going
6680,C  Beals,i loved this teacher the material is hard but explain it times if needed regular attendance is vital as tests comes from lectures quirky fun take him for lab as well textbook not needed but very helpful on a side note he looks talks acts just like a young matthew broderick watch the movie godzilla and see
6681,C  Beals,i absoultely loved this teacher if you are horrible at science take chris beals he is amazing he looks like harry potter he helped me understand so many things that i never understood in other science classes he talks to you like a student not a teacher he wants everyone to get an a and gives you extra points and extra credit great guy
6682,C  Beals,chris did a great job showing you what you needed to concentrate on in the labs for the exams and what you he walked you thorugh the labs and would help you anytime you needed him to via open labs phone calls or email great guy take him when you can there were exams and a couple quizzes but he gave you study guide for all of them
6683,C  Beals,a great teacher his first year back at vol state in a about five years he explains things as many times as you need it explained very good at explaining it and loves answering questions his test bad just study the notes and be fine he will help you out with anything you need and his pretty laid back
6684,C  Beals,very helpful always willing to explain things in a different way if you get it the first time tests are hard but come from his notes mostly wish he taught
6685,C  Beals,he is limitless in his energy and his love for biology he is always helpful and always willing to answer questions or look them up if he know the answer one of the best professors ever had
6686,C  Beals,he is a good teacher he is very helpful and always at open labs he made the class fun and i understood things better than i thought i would
6687,C  Beals,lab
6688,L  Schibig,very boring he reads from his powerpoints and expects you to learn on your own pretty much he is not hard you just have to keep yourself motivated because he sure wont
6689,L  Schibig,tough class i will have to say professor is very vague and all of the studying is up to you no hints at all as to what will be covered so basically you have to know every word in order to get a good grade tough but i have learned
6690,L  Schibig,i am in his last class before he retires be thankful you do not have to worry about him as your teacher he stay focused he goes off on things not related to this class his tests are overly in depth and he lies about what is actually on them he uses wrong solutions in the lab saying they work the same yet give different results
6691,L  Schibig,typical charles darwin believing biology teacher he is boring and his assignments are incomprehensible avoid
6692,L  Schibig,recommend him but its not impossible to pass his class i dropped it and am taking frank and farrar take those two guys if you can
6693,L  Schibig,i like his teaching style he is very vague when he teaches he once sent an email to all students sorry missed class i was busy i thought that was so rude i dropped his class after that episode i would suggest another biology teacher
6694,L  Schibig,i had him years ago and i can honestly say he is not good at teaching i have no idea where volstate finds their biology teachers but they need to start looking elsewhere
6695,L  Schibig,mr schbig is a super nice teacher he will help you in any way if you just ask his lectures are kind of boring but he gives you power point notes and reads straight from them all of the test are simple as long as you study the notes given to you human anatomy is a hard class and he understands that he really breaks things down for you great
6696,L  Schibig,passing this class is very simple just study the powerpoints thats it
6697,L  Schibig,his class is very boring he does not teach you he read to you and you must teach yourself he does not read the lab until he get into class he will mark off for things he did not ask for on labs and tests he is unorganized and has lost labs
6698,L  Schibig,he is very monotone but he prepares you for is tests they key is showing up to class everyday printing off the powerpoint notes take notes as he is talking and study like crazy i got an a and his tests were mostly fillin the blank as long as you study your heart out it does not matter who the teacher is you will get an a
6699,L  Schibig,he is a boring teacher to listen to he reads everything straight off the powerpoint his tests are incredible hard.he will put you to sleep during lecture i would take mann over this guy for lecture
6700,L  Schibig,not a bad teacher at all if you study you will make a good grade on the test if you miss any days in his class he will give you extra points on your final grade
6701,L  Schibig,he has all the personality of a carpet sample but his class is pretty cut and dry just print off the power point slides and study those if you do that you should be ok
6702,L  Schibig,schibig is a boring his class is not hard at all if you study the powerpoint notes you will pass the test i think that most students dont like him because they havent realized yet that this is college and not high school and that they need to grow up and do the work
6703,L  Schibig,dr schbig was awesome in the fact that he was incredibly easy made an a no problem he will put you to sleep while talking and has a dry old since of humor but its funny not a bad teacher for biology would recommend because incredibly easy
6704,L  Schibig,take schibig if you have to take mann this guy only cares about tennessee chesnut trees how does that relate to i know all test came from powere point and he reads that power point word for word very boring ugh and i liked this subject before i met him
6705,L  Schibig,lectures are all done with powerpoint slides test questions are taken from information in those slides good teacher knows his stuff and explains well for people new to anatomy
6706,L  Schibig,he is a little dull but a very thorough teacher he does no review for a test but his test come right from his power point notes he is growing on me he gives extra credit too he also lets you know what the extra credit is ahead of time give him a chance
6707,L  Schibig,his tests are made from his power point lectures but his tests did not look like anything that the class had covered he is not an understanding teacher he will address a problem that he has with a person in front of the class
6708,R  Skoglund,i signed up to take a science class not a sermon that ridicules current scientific theory his answer for how things came about is god did it he originally ridiculed evolution but he finally taught some science and briefly touched on evolution but after class he held a meeting for the religous fanatics in the class to explain why it was fals
6709,R  Skoglund,pretty good teacher he will tend to teach more to the pretty girls in the class and does waste a large amount of time flirting but over all not bad at least he grades pretty easy
6710,R  Skoglund,russ was one of the greatest professors i have ever had he will get off the subject and keep things light he is the coolest and it does not hurt that he is pretty easy on the eyes
6711,E  Alford,this professor is extremely easy helpful laid back and considerate of students being adults with busy lives beware that she makes everybody be socialable and participate so if you prefer to keep to yourself quietly you might have tough time attendance affects your grade with her but other than that its a very easy class
6712,Frederick  Frank,terrible very repetitive says one thing and does another i feel i would have done a whole lot better in this class if i had taken another professor would not recommend
6713,Frederick  Frank,dr frank is a great professor his lectures tend to be on the boring side but he tries to make it entertaining by throwing in jokes tests are easy if you really study the study guides always willing to help and work around your schedule always writes nice comments and smiley faces on exams if you do well great
6714,Frederick  Frank,great and very helpful dry sense of humor but when he gets down to business he demands respect when talking
6715,Frederick  Frank,i took frank for and he is a great teacher very helpful and understanding this class isnt easy but if you show up and show effort you should pass make sure to go to his test review classes they are very helpful definately recommend this teacher over all the others i recieved an a and and b in
6716,Frederick  Frank,dr frank is amazing i appreciated the stories he told about using what we were learning in his medical practice his tests are difficult but his reviews are incredible learn a lot with dr frank
6717,Frederick  Frank,very good teacher he gives out study guides which are a little helpful with the examns but as long as you attend class you will be fine he does gives a review class that you have to attend on your own at the given time he gives but if you can go he gives tremendous hints about what is on the exam i would recommend him to anyone
6718,Frederick  Frank,dr frank made my science experience great he is very caring when it comes to his students yes his jokes are old and outdated but his ability to teach is great i still remember the points he made utilizing those jokes
6719,Frederick  Frank,dr.frank is a great professor.i find it funny that all the bad ratings for dr.frank have bad grammar and spelling errors.study his review if you want a b know the book for an a he is very kind and considerate
6720,Frederick  Frank,really helpful and if you talk to him and ask him questions he will go out of his way to help you he wants everyone to succeed his class all you have to do is ask always helpful outside of class also
6721,Frederick  Frank,pretty easy as long as you keep the notes he gives you set
6722,Frederick  Frank,i think he is an awesome teacher i had to retake this class after summer course that was awful dr frank actually taught me something and was always willing to help he does not overcomplicate things at all hands out study guides of what will be on tests and offers extra credit
6723,Frederick  Frank,love dr frank funny nice willing to help anytime and really cares he knows a lot about ap and can answer most questions right away gives helpful handouts and all you have to do is listen and study it was a great class he made it fun and a lot less stressful would take him again
6724,Frederick  Frank,nice teacher tries to make the subject fun and is willing to help if you understand he gives out study guides with what will be on the test highly recommended
6725,Frederick  Frank,nice guy good teaher funny cares about students learning the material and succeeding in life highly recommend
6726,Frederick  Frank,very all over the place he likes to tell stories and unfunny jokes but a nice man and seems to care about the student he gives you study guides before the tests but some of the things on the test on the guide take lots of notes and read the text
6727,Frederick  Frank,he loves what he teaches funny teaches until the last second his lectures are scattered around sometimes very nice and always willing to help you or answer any questions tests are pretty hard in my opinion do not just study the he gives you study everything notes diagrams and book info overall great teacher o
6728,Frederick  Frank,so i took him for several classes and i always dropped him he goes too slow and repeats the same stories in every single class he made sleepy he also skips around on the subjects too so i could not organize the info in my head you have to be there his tests come straight from the notes write down everything he says
6729,Frederick  Frank,dr frank loves to teach and it shows he goes at a pace where everyone can keep up if anyone has a problem he will take the time to help i had him for both lab lecture and would definetly take him again
6730,Frederick  Frank,dr frank loves to teach and it shows he goes at a pace where everyone can keep up if anyone has a problem he will take the time to help i had him for both lab lecture and would definetly take him again
6731,Frederick  Frank,he was very helpful but hard to listen to as his voice is monotone i do like him and would reccomend him
6732,N  Morris,tough but awesome helped me realize i love biology with a passion too but be surprised if she picks favorites by the first test though how she weeds out her class and finds her star pupils
6733,N  Morris,scatterbrained is the best word to describe her i probably caught her class at a bad time because her dad was about to die and she probably should have taken the summer off to be with him instead of trying to teach also hard tests boring lectures pointless labs nice lady though
6734,N  Morris,overall class was hard she teaches by powerpoint but some of the info on the test is from the book so read her test are extra thats the only thing that you get a grade for in the lecture part of class theres no homework or anything so you must do well on the test i wouldnt take her again
6735,N  Morris,i loved her who is helpful and always but her tests were too hard too many questions that she teach in the class many questions on the tests came from the textbook which is more than pages
6736,N  Morris,now i kinda like her style i tell you what a bit eccentric but alright you just gotta put a lil elbow grease into the class however you is right about them labs they is just some long lectures
6737,N  Morris,she needs to be more enthusiastic in her classes you can easily fall asleep listening to her talk for an hour and a half
6738,N  Morris,no comments
6739,N  Morris,i hated ms way of teaching the whole semester all we did was go through powerpoint slides the tests commonly match what we had gone through in class and the labs were really just hour long lectures
6740,H  Mann,is an extremely hard class regardless of the teacher but prof mann was great not very enthusiastic but he tells you exactly what you need to know through his powerpoints all memorization you definitely have to study your butt of but as long as you do that you should do fine note cards are a must only used my book to study
6741,H  Mann,is hard prof mann makes it easier by being very precise with the material you always know what to expect on tests never a surprise if you study you will do well if you you probably but prof mann is an excellent teacher and does not overwhelm you
6742,H  Mann,the online class is great his test is basically directly off of his powerpoints it is worth taking his class he is easy and a down to earth teacher which makes easier to digest than others but is naturally a lot of material by itself i am in the nursing program just make sure your nursing program will accept an online class
6743,H  Mann,i thoroughly enjoyed professor biol class at the highland crest campus i will be taking him for biol this upcoming semester he tells you exactly what he expects you to know on each test there are no guessing games test questions come right from his power points
6744,H  Mann,dr mann is an awesome teacher he knows the material inside and out you know exactly what he expects on exams and where your grade stands at any point in the semester he uses schematics to explain main points and online lectures give you a chance to review for exams he is very helpful and an all around good person
6745,H  Mann,awesome professor he is extremely helpful and clear on what he expects from students need the book all lecture tests are from his power points lab study guides are very direct and helpful he is very understanding and treats students with respect wish he taught micro i recommend his hybrid class for sure
6746,H  Mann,dr mann is a class act he is very approachable clear cut helpful and generous he gives you every opportunity to succeed in a tough course just study his power point notes and audio lectures and really know pathways he is very enjoyable to listen to and has a great sense of humor
6747,H  Mann,mann is great a hard class but i love it
6748,H  Mann,dr mann is an amazing professor i had him for he is thorough in his lectures but not too much if you want to learn extra ask and he will tell you as much as like i learned so much in this class as long as you read the powerpoints and pay attention pass this class best professor had
6749,H  Mann,i took his summer i class and just like any other science it was a difficult but i did take the time to study and i passed with an a a great teacher he tells you exactly going to be one the tests i had to write papers but the maximum length was page and a half and if you do miss a class he has all his lectures online
6750,H  Mann,my favorite teacher so far professor mann makes this class enjoyable comfortable funny class is doable as long as you study he is knowledgeable helpful anytime you have a question explain it thoroughly wish he could teach all of my classes i have much respect for him as a teacher and as a person thanks mann will miss it
6751,H  Mann,mr mann is one of the best anatomy teachers at volstate he makes sure that you have all of the material that you need for the tests i will be taking him for anatomy
6752,H  Mann,i really like professor mann he was extremely clear about what he wanted and though his test were difficult they were completely doable if you put a little time into studying i would definitely recommend taking him he is an excellent teacher i plan to take him next semester and wish that he taught lectures at the gallatin campus
6753,H  Mann,dr mann rocks if you pay attention to his lectures in class and online he gives you everything you need to be successful he will explain anything to you but you have to ask this is not an easy class and you have to study the time you put in will directly show in your grade
6754,H  Mann,the absolute best professor i have ever had he is very intelligent and willing to help if willing to help yourself i barely cracked open my book every thing comes from his power points i would recommend him to anyone i took the hybrid class and loved it well as much as you can love anatomy
6755,H  Mann,professor mann is a great teacher his test come straight from the power point notes the essay questions for the test come from interactive phys he gives some extra credit throughout the semestermainly from mastering assignments you only need your book for the mastering assignments but you can use the etext instead to save money
6756,H  Mann,is hard no matter what but i did like dr mann he was clear about what he expected he did not give you a study guide for the tests but he did tell you what to study for the essay questions his tests were hard but he gives bonus and easy quizzes and extra credit i did not do well on the tests but still made a b
6757,H  Mann,i took lecture online and lab on campus lecture test are not the easiest alot of fill in the blanks lab was super easy i like mr mann and i will take him again he gives you alot of bonus points as well so if you do bomb a test you have a chance to make it up this class has alot of homework but not to hard
6758,H  Mann,there are online quizzes and lec exams online lab quizzes and lab exams a lot of info but his power points are awesome i hardly used the book mainly just used the power points there are chances for bonus points and extra credit he is very helpful and accessible i would take him for but he is not scheduled for that class
6759,H  Mann,excellent teaching skills gives lots of great tools to ensure that students keep up with assignments best professor had thus far
6760,R  Hackney,do the study guide that is the test fill it out and memorize it and get an a anyone saying otherwise is ridiculous and study very very possible to get an a in this class you use the book at all i had him for a and p and and micro got in all study
6761,R  Hackney,pretty cool guy easy to get along with i did well without the power points hand wrote the notes got an a with them talks real loud because he hear himself
6762,R  Hackney,very good teacher read over his powerpoints and you will pass all of the questions come from that he has mulitple choice fill in the blank definitions and essay questions which he gives you if you ask he also has a review study and you will do well
6763,R  Hackney,horrible unless this is the only class you are taking i dont recommend him you have to study literally everyday to maybe make a c his lab is ok but lecture is just ridiculous
6764,R  Hackney,mr.hackney is a great did micro with him and passed all subjects with an very pleasent and helpful.i never had a science background but i learnt a lot from him.what to do is study well his ppt reveiews.he gives quizzes exams.pls wait fr the last moment to study.sure u would pass with an a trust me
6765,R  Hackney,impossible to pass buy book and whatever you do forget to study
6766,R  Hackney,i have to retake this class ughh the test are way harder than expect them to be the book isnt required because all his notes are online lots of notes wish i would have read these comments last semester
6767,R  Hackney,his tests are very very hard hardly anyone passes them i would study for hours everyday and barely make a c he does know what he is talking about but sometimes he makes you out to be an idiot if you ask questions this is a very hard course take it and in the same semester buy the book lextures are straight from powerpoint
6768,R  Hackney,mr.hackney is a great teacher.i had him for i i know anything abt biology.i studied his ppt completely and the reviews.ipassed with an reccomend highly for all the biology need to buy the study his ppt notes.he covers everything and even comp exam was easy
6769,R  Hackney,he is a hard dry and boring but i made an a and i am no bookworm a lot of people give him a bad review becuase he is not and easy pass do the work required and you will do well he gives you studyguides this is college not kindergarden not supposed to be easy
6770,R  Hackney,he would announce ppl rcvd an a b or c on exams thats a passing rate textbook is useless never opened it he does his best to humiliate you for your lack of knowledge no open discussion you show up take off the take exam if you request any information or ask for clarification you do this at your own risk
6771,R  Hackney,this is not an easy subject but mr hackney presents it in a straightforward clear manner if your willing to do your part you will get a good grade
6772,R  Hackney,the class is confusing we do not have a textbook and he does not teach to each student
6773,R  Hackney,i took micro lab and it was easy except for the tests of course i had carter for lecture wish i could have gotten into lecture too
6774,R  Hackney,he is not one of my favorite teachers if you like to stare at power points the whole class then you will be fine he does give you the review but if you expect the test to be worded anything like the review then think again you better know the material inside and out you will definately earn your grade in this class
6775,R  Hackney,a great teacher and he makes a tough subject a little easier he gives you study guides and just wants you to grasp the main ideas he stress the tiny details he really knows all about anything even related to the subjects we discuss in class reccommend him to anyone who needed to take i or ii or micro
6776,R  Hackney,mr hackney is a wonderful teacher and if you just take the time to memorize all of his powerpoints you will do great in this class oh and buy the book only opened up times and could have found the info from it elsewhere and saved
6777,R  Hackney,buy the book write down all of his powerpoint notes and be ok super nice person decent teacher tests hard but review completely covers the test
6778,R  Hackney,he is thorough but if you study and keep up the material the class really hard i got an a
6779,Duane  Castanier,the best professor i have had at emu he is so passionate and this class is so relevant to the education department he loves discussion and is completely interested in his there is a ton of reading but he has perfected this course so that all readings are appropriate loved this professor
6780,Duane  Castanier,i really enjoyed this class his discussions were important and relevant to education today however there is usually a right opinion to have in his class know what it is papers are only and are ridiculously regimented there is a thesis template i felt like a was writing a meap essay again
6781,Duane  Castanier,d is a truly remarkable educator he is passionate about what he practices and it transcends to the students he is an inspiring professor and the writing intensive part of the course is hardly noticeable in part because we write a little every day it is reading intensive however the reading is valuable and fascinating
6782,Duane  Castanier,i enjoyed a lot of the material it is a discussion based class and it can be fun although i had a dissenting opinion once and i felt a little disrespected by d i got over it and he hold it against me i think we did a lot of writing because it was little pieces every class period and not a lot of big papers good class overall
6783,Duane  Castanier,the class the most interesting but d is great really funny and nice and loves what doing expect a lot of reading participation in class and attendance is key he just wants you to have an opinion and about what discussing
6784,Duane  Castanier,he will do everything to help you with anything he is a super nice and funny guy
6785,Duane  Castanier,the readings are interesting and his lectures are very participatory he truly cares about and respects his students d sets a great example for future teachers
6786,Duane  Castanier,the stands for writingintensive it is our required coe writingintensive course shocker a ton of work d is the best teacher in the coe passionate engaging and he makes you think the reading are all connected and you learn a ton about how to effectively teach in our diverse world one of my top classes
6787,Duane  Castanier,very good and very helpful most of class is selfgraded and very helpful on the parts that expect to do a lot of reading and participate a lot in class the class can seem a little pointless but easy to fake it until you make it
6788,Duane  Castanier,lots of reading you are expected to keep up and be engaged in class participation matters to this professor so if you speak up expect to do well the curve is a bit strange a is an a overall dee asks you to think about some important ideas and engage in a high level of discourse
6789,Duane  Castanier,this class involves a lot of reading in class you grade yourself on how well you prepared for that day you actually do that quite often his grading scale is not the regular scale a is an a and a is a he chooses favorites it was an alright class but i really get anything out of it
6790,Duane  Castanier,he is very passionate about his subject area and loves for students to be enthusiastic he wants everyone contributing in class discussions he definitely has favorites and even though i was one of them it made me very uncomfortable you do as well if you have a different opinion than he does which is not fair he really cares about the cl
6791,Duane  Castanier,very informative class what i liked best was that the class work was not lecturebased it was discussion but also included dynamic higher level learning activities the course content is very useful for diverse classroom settings the readings and issues brought up in the course are relevant all viewpoints were encouraged and excepted
6792,Duane  Castanier,dr castanier is an asset to emu staff and all education students he shares information that is pertinent to creating a professional teacher
6793,Duane  Castanier,duane is a great professor and role model the work the class is alot but u should already know that coming in2 any sofd class he loves his job which reflects his passion for the class lots of busy work but nothing major very eye opening course you will take with you for the rest of your teaching career emu should be proud have him
6794,Duane  Castanier,i impressed with this professor at all he is a very nice person but as a prof i was unhappy with the unreasonable workload and how he plays favorites this is the most useless class in the coe but everyone must take it not horrible but definitely get in on his good side and do well
6795,Duane  Castanier,castiner cares a little too much about al this stuff most of the readings are not that exciting though a few are potentially useful he thinks all of the reading connect to each other somehow there is a typed hw assmt due every class hw is self graded but is still a hassle also get on his good side and you have smooth sailing
6796,Duane  Castanier,best class yet in the department of education truly useful material thanks d
6797,Duane  Castanier,great teacher
6798,Duane  Castanier,by far the best teacher and course that i have ever taken in my life this class is a lto fo hard work but you enjoy it there is a lot of reading but most of the class time is spent on discussions every educaiton major should take this course with dee
6799,L  Stephens,terrible grading system believe us on the posts here to take a different teacher if you can i thought it would not be as bad i was wrong take another teacher if you can
6800,L  Stephens,terrible teacher will not let you redo anything she has a weird grading system so good luck making an a in her class i will not ever take her again for another class
6801,L  Stephens,this was an easy class mrs stephens was always eager to help out in any way gives a crazy amount of bonus points i mean seriously sure gotta study but if you take it online use your textbook when you take tests the tests are straight from it as long as you follow the simple instructions not bad at all i made a ha
6802,L  Stephens,there is a ton of reading involved in this class the teacher is helpful and good about returning emails and calls the assignments are not that bad but the tests are horrible she offers extra credit for pop quizzes over each chapter do them it will help your overall grade
6803,L  Stephens,slow at returning emails slow at grading and opening tests to review rude unprofessional will not take her for anything ever again will not listen to reasoning and questions students speaks down to those who disagree with her teaching methods and avoids questions and concerns as well do not take her if you can find another to take
6804,L  Stephens,i learned a lot but when it came to tests and assignments she is overly ready to give you an f she curve even when only person passes i ended up withdrawing from this class so i could retake it with a different professor terrible online class listen to this review and the other reviews on here wait or take another prof
6805,L  Stephens,hard to take as an online class did not return emails very very slow at grading assignments assignments are randomly placed throughout the semester lets you know after the deadline that the test period has been extended not helpful when you ask her questions i would take another teacher if i had the opportunity to
6806,L  Stephens,gives vaugue instructions for the submission of assignments that may appear in vaious places will give over half the class a zero if her pet instruction followed futhermore there a clear grading ruprick so you will never know how she will grade not a pleasent experience
6807,L  Stephens,not that bad her tests are open book
6808,L  Stephens,there is no point to listen in class i took notes and when i took my first test my notes did not help me i just looked streight out of the book
6809,L  Stephens,she is the worst teacher ever stay very far away she will not explain anything in class or if you miss when you ask a question she exactly answer it the test are extremly hard even if you go to class take it will hurt
6810,L  Stephens,she extremely clear but a very nice lady who knows what she is talking about when it comes to business i would suggest taking her class or at least into to bus
6811,L  Stephens,do not take offers no help and her tests are nothing like what you expect
6812,L  Stephens,she confuses you when she teaches and her test are not easy she like to keep you informed what your work is or what they did in class if you miss a day
6813,L  Stephens,very hard take
6814,L  Stephens,no comments
6815,L  Stephens,no comments
6816,T.  Moore,this was a good class i am a veteran typist but really enjoyed the class and learned a lot i have arthritis but still did well in the class professor moore my actual instructor but she wrote the syllabus and information and was helpful when help was needed
6817,T.  Moore,assignments are heavy and instructions are walls of text exams online are difficult with fill in the blank answers that must be exact this is a good class if you want to be a secretary and redundant in word if you take infs1010 another required class this class should focus on typing only she makes assumptions about disabilities arthritis
6818,T.  Moore,i had her this year for bus comm online very nice and helpful the assignments are easy and their are so so so many extra credit quizzes and they have unlimited amount of times you can summit would def take her if i could again
6819,T.  Moore,if you want to learn how to type without looking at your fingers take this class you will also learn how to format business documents which should help you in your job really good class
6820,T.  Moore,if you want to know how to use word take this class mrs moore is great
6821,T.  Moore,if you need a refresher in grammar this is the course for you there are no prerequisites for this class but mrs moore does a really good job teaching grammar i know i needed this class i recommend it to everyone
6822,T.  Moore,great class there is a lot of work but i needed it to learn the skill mrs moore is very helpful but you have to meet the deadlines this is good for me because my job is going to require the same thing
6823,T.  Moore,do not take this class if it is not required for your degree there is a rediculous amount of work to complete each week all very repetitive easy work but takes forever to do and you must have word available the free trial version work with the software you have to install
6824,T.  Moore,it would be nice if she be so relentless about the documents and the grammar i understand your intent but this is a typing class not an english class if you wanna teach english maybe you should go back to school t moore maybe then get what like i hope you have a teacher just like you maybe then change
6825,T.  Moore,the most difficult part of this class is the grammar portion after being out of school for yrs the grammar killed me if the grammar had not been included difficult when the class is on business would have made a better grade.would be better to take while in english or soon after not yrs later
6826,T.  Moore,quick paced class but as long as one does the work easy to keep up hard to catch up based on work load if one gets behind alot of information in the text to cover as long as one does the work not a hard class to pass very informative helpful if you ask patient and willing to help just ask
6827,T.  Moore,i took classes with mrs moore intermediate keyboarding and word for windows int keyboarding was a lot more work than i expected i thought the course would be speed driven but it had tons of documents to complete mrs moore is more than willing to help if you just ask i learned a lot with mrs moore great
6828,T.  Moore,bus under mrs moore is one of the best courses i have ever had she stresses grammar which is very helpful to me i learned a lot from her class take her if you can
6829,T.  Moore,great teacher just do your work and an a is easy
6830,T.  Moore,mrs moore is a great teacher who knows her subjects and is helpful to all students she has high expectations of her students but is clear in these expectations you have to meet deadlines but this is great preparation for the future
6831,T.  Moore,mrs moore is an excellent teacher she knows her subjects and is helpful to all she requires students to do their best and to abide by all deadlines but that is what real life is like she does a great job preparing students for their futures
6832,T.  Moore,mrs moore is a great teacher she is always happy too keyboarding is a breeze for me i key apprx wpm making an easy a in this class the assignments are super easy but you have to do them everynight or you will get behind just like with any class study tests are easy love this teacher take her if you can fun
6833,T.  Moore,this was the hardest class i have ever taken the work is not hard or confusing but it takes up hours of your time if you are not an expert typist i learned alot and studied hard and only ended up with a b
6834,T.  Moore,if you have to take her keyboarding class take the hybrid class i thought it would be awesome only meeting once every two weeks but she clear on how the homework should be turned in i missed one thing in a lesson and i received a zero for the whole thing very sweet lady just not right for teaching
6835,T.  Moore,i wonder if vol state monitors teaching methods five points off for each mistakeone mistake and you go from an a to a c if you have all the documents turned in you get a zero if you must take her class read the syllabus every week and take every opportunity for extra need it
6836,A  Ruttenbur,ms ruttenbur was extremely helpful in class she made it a priority for all students to participate and grasp the information she wanted us to learn the material and not simply memorize text
6837,A  Ruttenbur,easy teacher but absolutely worthless all work is busy work and none of it is useful if you are required to take other business courses you will learn everything you need to know i would not recommend this professor to anyone interested in learning
6838,A  Ruttenbur,nice lady but teach anything clearly mostly busy work
6839,A  Ruttenbur,prof ruttenbur is the bomb she is fun to be in class with helps you with anything you need assistance with and the homework that you do hard but is very informative recommend her extremely
6840,A  Ruttenbur,very helpful and wonderful teacher i had her for bus and she teaches other classes as well very easy
6841,J  Espey,this is only a point class out of the points are tests there are test in the semester if you do not read the book it is hard to make a good grade
6842,J  Espey,this class is so much fun dr espey wants you to learn which is or supposed to be the point of college he often tells stories and makes lessons easily relatable to real life scenarios marketing is an interesting field and he makes it more interesting listen to people who tell you not to take him you will learn so much
6843,J  Espey,hate this professor a student who loves all my professors thought i loved him too very tough especially with his grading took off points because i had a comma in the wrong spot help if you go to him he told me good luck other students have told me the same he use technology read anything he writes
6844,J  Espey,very thorough about the text and very entertaining to listen to but god help you if you miss turning in an assignment at the end of the semester i turned a few in after finals and it took the guy months to change my incomplete to a b and he only did so after i sicked my advisor on him
6845,J  Espey,mr espey is a wonderful teacher he is friendly helpful and always interested in what one has to say i have enjoyed him so much i am taking a different class with him next semester
6846,J  Espey,he is enthusiastic but a
6847,J  Espey,no comments
6848,J  Espey,i never can get enough of this class makes me think about becoming a marketing major very enthusiastic professor who includes life experiences along with class time keeps things moving and has a lot of research based knowledge
6849,B  Bratcher,he is not terribly hard very kind and fair in his grading i took classes this one was my favorite by far however this is college so you will have to study
6850,B  Bratcher,if you want to learn anything to help you in your future eng class this is not the teacher for you he rambles on about his life with very little about english itself his class was useless and i did not learn anything except not to take his class again
6851,B  Bratcher,very cool loved him so helpful and easy going
6852,B  Bratcher,he is very laid back if you already know mla you will find yourself correcting him in your mind very minimal class time which is good because he tends to ramble and get off track all in all he is very helpful and is available for further questions
6853,B  Bratcher,very interesting and laid back more interested in us writing than lectures
6854,B  Bratcher,if you want to drive all the way to school for nothing this is the professor to have we have four grades the entire semester and going to the library is considered class i also think he is very confusing an easy a but i consider it a waste of my time
6855,B  Bratcher,i had no clue who this man was but he turned out a really good teacher most of the kids in the class got and there is not alot of homework
6856,B  Bratcher,best teacher ever god so cool easy a every time and such a down to earth old man i took all my englishes with him and near amazing very good teacher and so easy awesome
6857,M  Nunaley,no comments
6858,M  Nunaley,absolutley amazing
6859,M  Nunaley,she was a good teacher and made thing very clear
6860,Parris  Powers,professor powers is the best teacher i have ever had he loves to teach more than anything and you can tell this because of his enthusiasm and love for chemistry he is an awesome person and does anything to help his students his organic class is hard but it is the best class i have ever taken you will love his teaching
6861,Parris  Powers,this class was super eassyy but super booring i could barley stay awake in there he does not require a lot of work which is great the professor is very bad with getting you your grades on your work so you never really know what you have in the class
6862,Parris  Powers,powers is a really cool professor he cares about his students the class hold my interest a lot of the time but it was extremely easy otherwise i also learned a lot from the class though a lot of it was very random and unorganized
6863,Parris  Powers,ok i will start off saying he is a good teacher and a nice dude but if you arent into chem i wouldnt take him he is really hard and yes i ended up with a b but i worked hard for it he wants to help you and wants you to make a good grade i just think hes too smart to teach kids that arent up to par with him
6864,Parris  Powers,super nice guy and really enjoyed teaching but i honestly would not recommend him if you are taking more than one class he gives a rediculous amnt of hmwk and runs through the math for someone that had math or chem in a while way too difficult to understand
6865,Parris  Powers,i took his gen chem class as a week summer course he is hands down my favorite instructor had i consider him a lifelong contact and i learned so much from him incredibly easy to talk to about his class your goals your education this man cares about his students chemistry easy so be willing to try and do just fine
6866,Parris  Powers,the lecture exams cover at least chapters at a time the labs are pretty easy and straight forward he is helpful but wants you to think for yourself.do the homework ask questions you can call him email or even stop by his office he will help if you ask for it a tough subject practice the math until you have it down
6867,Parris  Powers,read do the homework show up for miss ask questions make flashcards you will need them make sure your math skills are at a college algebra or higher level also beware of spelling errors he will count you off even though notice he misspells and places commas incorrectly a great teacher though
6868,Parris  Powers,with lot of expectations i took this class mr.powers covers a whole lot of topics within a short span of time.he covered one if u study well his questions are hard.if he should given handouts been diff atleast to mehe to curve the grades finally
6869,Parris  Powers,a great teacher very helpful and attentive talks about his son a lot but really good person main thing you gotta take notes and you gotta study tons of homework online that takes forever but the homework is useful start off the class with a negative mentality study all vocabs and all math laws he shows great teacher
6870,Parris  Powers,the subject was hard for me but as long as you study take notes attend class and ask him for help you can do well he is very willing to help those who ask
6871,Parris  Powers,i hated chemistry still do but he makes it as good as it can be go to class do not miss ask questions visit his office he will help those who try do pc homework be active in lectures he cares if you do this isnt an easy class once you know that prepare and transcend do not miss class had him for lab.the same sentiments my grade b
6872,Parris  Powers,powers is a wonderful teacher the class is very difficult but he makes it easier i would def take him again if i need more chemistry
6873,Parris  Powers,great professor he was my favorite chemistry teacher he is very clear and helpful i would def take him again if i needed to take organic as i had him also for general chemistry i got an a
6874,Parris  Powers,parris powers is great he actually cares about his students and wants them to succeed he is always willing to help feel free to stop by his office it does wonders chemistry is hard no doubt but his method of teaching is very down to earth and easy to comprehend i was scared to death about taking chemistry and made an a in his class
6875,Parris  Powers,mr powers is very intimidating now that i have been in class awhile i see that he is very helpful his tests are very hard he loves chemistry and it shows
6876,Parris  Powers,i was scared to death of chemistry before taking this class mr powers is awesome and one of the best teachers i have had so far he makes it interesting and makes a hard subject easy to learn he will explain until we understand and opens up for questions i highly recommend him for fundamentals of chemistry
6877,Parris  Powers,he is so helpful and informative sometimes the lectures blow you away but he is so full of information the labs are super easy but really helpful his tests are extremely hard and do pay attention to definitions because they are on the test if you want to learn chemistry and have it stick with you take this guy
6878,Parris  Powers,hard to read this guy nice one day and very serious and nonjoking the next overall i would say he knows his stuff alot of things on the test are very misleading so be sure to study outside of the notes and pay attention to definitions
6879,Parris  Powers,awesome teacher and hallarious his tests are a shot in the dark though and you have no idea how going to grade that night his labs are a gimmie which is helpful the tests are tough though so prepare to study the chem department at vscc is not a joke much harder than mtsu trust me i know
6880,J  Neilan,he is very hard to follow he gives a lot of in class examples on the day the material is introduced but doesnt do much review before the test i probably wouldnt take another one of his classes he is very nice though
6881,J  Neilan,while he is a smart professor he is very difficult to understand he review with us over our material but will tell us to just study over the chapters instead i personally take him again as some of the other professors were much easier to work with for assistance
6882,J  Neilan,bad teacher
6883,J  Neilan,i took neilan for fundamentals of chemistry and he is an incredibly helpful teacher but a lot of his exams are extremely tricky be prepared to study enough a few days before the exam to fully comprehend the material on the bright side he is extremely nice laid back and approachable for any questions you have he does what he can to help
6884,J  Neilan,he is a good professor if you go to his class everyday and ask questions i went to his tutor classes and those did not help me his tests you really need to study for and you never really know what is going to be on them a lot of them seem like trick questions
6885,J  Neilan,i loved his class this class was my first chemistry class ever he made it a great experience he is very helpful if you understand the material he will help you pay attention take lots of notes ask questions read the material take notes and do the homework he gives extra credit during the semester so do it great professor
6886,J  Neilan,nice guy very smart but should not teach he knows chemistry but he teaches like he is at yale and is crazy hard to understand and when you get your test back it looks like it has been through battle with all of the red on it i have nothing against him like i said he is extremely smart just cant teach or relate his knowledge to students
6887,J  Neilan,dr neilan is a fantastic teacher and anyone who disagrees care about putting forth effort organic is a hard class but he will do what it takes to make sure you get it he truly cares about his students as well and takes time to let you know he appreciates your hard work funny helpful and his class has been a wonderful experience
6888,J  Neilan,mr neilan is a a very nice professor if you attend class every day and he sees that you are making a effort he is not good at rephrasing how to do a particular aspect such as math in a different way if you do not get it the way he teaches your pretty much out of luck he trys to be involved in helping you but he cant explain things differently
6889,J  Neilan,dr.neilan is a grt instructor with a grt wealth of knowledge.very down to earth though.always respond to ur emails.i had him fr lab he was very helpful.i missed the opp to take him for lecture
6890,J  Neilan,mr neilan is a good teacher not easy you have to study and pay attention he expects you to study and hard he tell you what will be on the test but he will hint at it really funny and cares about you learning i would recommend him for someone who wants to really wants to learn chemistry he knows his stuff and you can te
6891,J  Neilan,do not take this guy for chemistry warning you will not pass
6892,J  Neilan,he would not answer questions he would make you guess and feel dumb for asking the question did not offer any extra credit to help reach your goal i studied for hours outside of class and could not make above a c on his test they are hard
6893,J  Neilan,nice teacher very smart knows chemistry extrememly well he is not an easy teacher some people have said you have to do extra work to get an a thats exactly right you need to be there everyday take lots of notes and study alot to pass not a just go to class and do work and pass heard other chem teachers are way easier especially in lab
6894,J  Neilan,i had him for chem hes alright his teaching methods are kind of confusing he gives multiple choice quizzes which is helpful at times although i myself didnt do very well i think that if you pay very close attention to the first few chapters then the general material will begin to make sense hes also got an extremely northern accent
6895,J  Neilan,i really enjoyed having mr neilan as my professor he is a sweet man he knows his stuff and will help you as much as you need just ask the class isnt easy but if you study do the recommended work and pay attention in class you will do fine he really likes to make the class interesting and keep the class involved
6896,J  Neilan,his class so bad but his tests are difficult if you dont work outside of class on it you pass do the extra problems if you want to pass
6897,J  Neilan,he is brilliant in his field and an excellent professor who is more than willing to help i had him for lab and he was easier than dr snelling in lab the only problem is he is slightly difficult to understand due to his bostonian accent my major is chemistry so i understood it well take him if you can
6898,J  Neilan,mr neilin is a good teacher to take fundmentals of chem from.he gets poeple involved in class and he gives lots of handouts.i am a person that learns best by interacting reading the book and doing extra homework.this teacher is extreamly patient if you ask dumb questions and will help you after class.take him if you are a thourough learning typ
6899,J  Neilan,i hate it when teachers are so anal about their time schedule they never review for the test which is always on monday to ruin your weekend before a big test we finish the chapters ahead of schedule and he went right into the some god awful chapter not even on the test how about a review or answer some questions we might have
6900,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,best class ever i enjoyed the way professor jasekrysdahl taught the class he made economics easy to understand if you pay attention and do the study guide then you have trouble passing the exams
6901,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,his class was really great his lectures were really interesting and he used recent events so you can relate if you do all the homework and do alright on the test then pass the homework is extremely easy attendance mandatory but you do group work in class somewhat often
6902,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,i enjoyed the way he lectured but you really have to work for your grade in this class i recommend you to print the notes out and just fill in the blanks there was a weekly online hw and quiz but they were usually pretty easy just as long as you put some effort into studying for the exam do fine
6903,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,best class ever i just took this class to fill some of g.e credit but it was more than what i expected you have to take notes or printed them out you also have online quizzes and hw easy and some problems sets the tests are multiple choice and also short answer questions i really recommend this class
6904,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,if you just go to the lecture take very good notes and do the study guide you will pass his lectures are clear and understandable he gives current examples to allow the student to understand the topic at hand homework quizzes and in class work are given tests are mainly multiple choice but problem sets are also included
6905,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,take the online class if econ is one of your prereq his collaborate sessions are very helpful he is always available via email has so far given so many quizzes more opportunities to redeem your grade.good learned a lot take it if your interested in learning and it will not be a major burden in your life
6906,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,awesome professor very clear lectures understands students and goes out of his way to help answers questions and helps with assignments if you go to his office hours
6907,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,professor rysdahl is a great professor takes a subject most dont care about and brings it to the maximum of relevance got on easiness cause of material not him take him learn so much in his class
6908,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,attend class to take notes expect him to give favoritism to certain students by spending more time with them during inclass work he will also talk about his own students to other faculty members in hopes that it will affect treatment of certain students by faculty expect tension between students when taking his course bc of this avoid him
6909,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,he is an awesome economics teacher i am taking another class next semester
6910,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,his notes are not hard to follow it would be nice if his feedback was more direct than indirect in grading assignments when it comes time to take tests more frustrating to put down answers than it is about doing exams because the questions seem to be clear about what he is asking
6911,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,best economics professor at stanislaus probably best teacher had over all took him for macro micro awesome
6912,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,memorizes every students name knows exactly where he stopped lecture last time fast turnaround on tests and hmwk fast response to email textbook and lecture note combo one question bb quiz with hr window per wk prior to hmwk due dates willing to check it and show you where to make corrections sample tests provided on bb
6913,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,this guy should be in research for a walmart stores.very hard and worthles lecture spent on graphing graphing
6914,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,very hard long tests too many in class assignments and home assignments not recommended
6915,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,he is hard but very helpful if you want the grade you have to earn it
6916,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,i agree he is very hard most of the time is wasted on graphs and not lecture from the text very hard and complicated
6917,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,very very hard his time is spent on learning to graph demand too many assignments and the final is really hard not recomended
6918,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,extremely hard too many papers class assignments too much materials covered for a unit class
6919,Kelvin  Jasek-Rysdahl,he is very clear teacher his tests are hard especially the final it cumulative but it was extremely hard he is willing to help which is very nice you can take your papers in and have him look at them and he will grade them before you turn them in and give them back to you to correct i would recommend him for anyone
6920,Jim  Curtis,best teacher i have ever had loved his classes more then other i took rip jim you will be missed greatly
6921,Jim  Curtis,the late professor curtis has interesting lectures but the de course is on cruisecontrol now almost no interaction feedback or help questions are based almost entirely on the text print out your tests because half the questions reappear on the final exam
6922,Jim  Curtis,prof curtis was an intelligent and truly selfless man he was extremely laid back and unassuming so glad i got a chance to have him as a teacher
6923,Jim  Curtis,prof curtis was an absolutely incredoble teacher he cared so much for his students and was always willing to help his loss will be deeply felt by all miss you prof curtis
6924,Jim  Curtis,easy fun and great
6925,Jim  Curtis,very good prof puts interest of students at the top does not lie about his exams very easy just study the text and go to his lectures willing to help at any time and clarify things if needed very considerate and nice approachable too take his class as elective definitely enjoy it
6926,Jim  Curtis,great prof cares so much for his students and is so nice to everyone exams bad at all however sociology is a very boring subject
6927,Jim  Curtis,jim curtis is a teaching god and his son is very sexy
6928,Jim  Curtis,jim curtis is a great prof distance ed was great i listen to any of the lectures yet i still got an a
6929,Jim  Curtis,good course not terribly difficult just make sure if you take the de course you know the assignments really well for your final and bother with the lecture notes too much prof give any answers away but still very helpful
6930,Jim  Curtis,really super nice guy likes to teach and is there to help you out in any way he can very helpful if you have a problem in the course course is interesting readings are fairly easy
6931,Jim  Curtis,no comments
6932,Jim  Curtis,boring class but really easy
6933,Jim  Curtis,easy course wants students to do well classes are kinda boaring most of the test questions come from the textbook he looks like santa
6934,Jim  Curtis,amazing prof great class if it for him i have decided to major in sociology wish he taught more classes
6935,Jim  Curtis,easy course bother too much with the tapes read the text and practice with assignments exam is all the assignments put together
6936,Jim  Curtis,took distance ed course so boring i listen to the lectures they put my to sleep he never got back to me about any of my questions and all his supplementary material was very out of date
6937,Jim  Curtis,interesting lectures but not nessisarily exciting read your text or doomed on the exams
6938,Jim  Curtis,extremely nice and helpful pro
6939,Jim  Curtis,loved doing his distance ed course he was very clear and enjoyable to listen to the assignments and exams were reasonable and clear highly recommend
6940,D  Witt,great personality little confused sometimes overall okay
6941,V  Hunter,she is very kind although hard to understand has a great grading scale and gave extra credit very often in lectures will stay after and help you comprehend
6942,V  Hunter,i had her from lab the first day or so it was hard to understand her she does yell when she talks and is hard to read she grades hard on her labs but if you copy the problems word for word you will get a on them all do not miss a lab if you intend to pass
6943,V  Hunter,her accent makes it very hard for her students to understand her she yells when she talks so it makes it worse she always seems to be in a bad mood she gets irritated when you ask questions she also rushes you to finsh your lab i would not recommend taking her for chemistry
6944,V  Hunter,this teacher has a very thick accent creating a language barier with her studens she is easily frustrated when a student understand her i do not recommened taking organic chem with her over the summer it is a nightmare
6945,V  Hunter,i reccoment this teacher her accent makes communication difficult the first half of the semester she showed films of someone else lecturing from our book the second half she she lectured for min before busy work she yells if you understand not works with you also expects you to know material before its covered in class boo
6946,V  Hunter,if you like science and know it well take her if not she is fair with grading but her tests are difficult and she does not have patience with those who catch on quick science is not my subject and she made me feel really dumb by acting as if it was so simple and that i should have already known it all.plus she has a rly thick accen
6947,V  Hunter,will never take her again she is not helpful if you do not understand she will raise her voice like her getting louder will help one to understand better her test are very hard i am pretty sure that she picks the hardest problem possible to give to you just to try and make you fail over all i like her
6948,V  Hunter,will take her again dropped lowest test score and lab plus curved the test grades very helpful can ask any questions as many times as needed she makes chemistry easy
6949,V  Hunter,she was very easy and very lenient with grading everything even on our tests she added points one time i am taking her again in the fall for chemistry
6950,V  Hunter,she is awesome i have alot of trouble with science and she made is fun and easy she gives zero homework and its all done in class plus the homework in class is the same as the test so just study a few min and an easy a take her
6951,V  Hunter,the world of chemistry comes easy to ms hunter and she give the impression that it should come easy to everyone she is fair to students but has little patience if you understand what she is explaining or if you are taking too long in lab for someone who is starting back to college after years out a tough teacher to start off
6952,V  Hunter,she didnt teach much most of the class was spent watching a video or going through powerpoints then gave an inclass assignment based on them tests were the exact same questions as on the homework so just memorize them and you should get an easy a on the exams also allowed us to skip the final if we did well on the first tests take for ez a
6953,V  Hunter,this teacher was helpful and pretty easy i took her for chem lab and got an a in the lab science is my worst subject but she got me through it
6954,V  Hunter,i heard she would be a difficult teacher but i found her to be quite helpful and learned many things in her class
6955,V  Hunter,o.k wow never laughed more in class as i did in her class and mostly out of insanity she is so not good teacher nice eventually but really hard the only reason she will let up on the assignments is if she thinks in a class of idiots take her as a last resort also really hard to understand
6956,V  Hunter,this was an awful teacher she was completly unhelpful and her tests were very hard i do not recomend anyone to take her class
6957,V  Hunter,no comments
6958,B  Jobe Jr.,easy class make sure you skip it attendance is important other than that its a very relax atmosphere
6959,B  Jobe Jr.,if you want a teacher that actually take him confusing he makes you take tests that he cover better have a photographic memory beware that he does require attendance miss classes and a whole grade is deducted you better be an energetic speaker or screwed
6960,B  Jobe Jr.,i took his night class that was held on mondays it was a good class he actually teach however i did not mind that at all in fact much of his class was straight to the point you hear a small number of speakers watch some movies take quizzes and final exam plus you do a speech almost every week skip class
6961,B  Jobe Jr.,i took his speech class and i loved him if you have any brain you should make an a not a tough grader on the speeches because he understands that people are naturally better or worse speakers you are on your own with the test because he cover anything in the book just read the chapters over and do fine
6962,B  Jobe Jr.,just talk for the time he wants you to and do your outlines and speaker critiques and youll be good really easy and laid back watched a lot of movies
6963,B  Jobe Jr.,great guy if you a smart ass get along with him just fine
6964,B  Jobe Jr.,he doesnt not teach at all all he does is give speeches and they are due the next class meeting
6965,B  Jobe Jr.,i did well i do not even know if he has a text book but he will give test on it test the test are the same amount of points as the speeches he will explain the speeches but the test you are on your own
6966,B  Jobe Jr.,i was dreading taking this class but mr jobe makes it easy he explains what he wants out of a speech but other than that he lets students be as open as they want to be it was very entertaining i learned a lot through my peers and material i did speeches on make sure you come to class and act like you have some sense it will be an a
6967,B  Jobe Jr.,professor jobe is great it is a class so no he doesnt speak often but the point is for you too if you are an intelligent person you will enjoy his class you do need to study on your own but this is college not highschool i was nervous to speak and his class helped me greatly take him if you need this class
6968,B  Jobe Jr.,speeches ran late day he said me others would go next classso we all do he knocked points off for being overly unfair about attndnce too tests are xtrmly difficult due to him never reviewing get ready do all the speaking too students had to do more speaking than he did how bout earning your paycheck mr j
6969,B  Jobe Jr.,i do agree that he did not really ever go over anything in the book and then his tests were based solely on the book extremely difficult not knowing what to look for to study however most of the semester is spent on obtaining actual speech experience expect to spend a lot of time in front of the class talking pretty good teacher though
6970,B  Jobe Jr.,i would reccomend him for anyone if you pay attention you will see the big picture of his class i learned alot of life lessons i would take him again if i had the chance
6971,B  Jobe Jr.,he was super nice easy class as of work you have three tests maybe or speeches that usually have to be to mins long but most of the time i was like minutes and still got an a i recommend taking him his class was also fun
6972,B  Jobe Jr.,his class was very easy he passed people who had really bad speeches we watched alot of movies and wasted time to get an a
6973,B  Jobe Jr.,very easy but bad sense of humor and does not go over the material but of your grade is on the speeches themselves anyway
6974,B  Jobe Jr.,this class was easy intresting speech topics did not go over in class but very easy tests nice guy
6975,B  Jobe Jr.,this is my second time taking his class not becuz i pay attention or becuz i show up or becuz i blew on the speeches but becuz i bombed the final cuz he went over absolutely nothing that was on it and he has a very dry sence of humor
6976,B  Jobe Jr.,he gives tests over chapters at a time and never tells us what is on the test he does have an alright sence of humor at times but it would be nice to get some help on the class work sometimes
6977,J  Gains,she was one of the best teachers i have had in a long time i really appreciated how she gives you an assignment schedule you will do very well if you read the chapters and do not procrastinate seriously when you get to midsemester things really start to move quickly
6978,J  Gains,gaines was a good teacher she really cares about her job and she interacts with the students well at times her lectures and classes can be entertaining i had her for speech communications and the speeches we had to do were not that bad her tests are not that hard although sometimes they can be a little tricky i would reccommend her
6979,J  Gains,i throughly enjoyed her class it was the easiest one i took all semester she is an excellent teacher and makes things fairly interesting
6980,J  Gains,she was a very nice and helpful teacher i would recomend her class to everyone her class was not difficult and took almost no study time yea for learning
6981,J  English,he was the best teacher i ever had he was hard but a really fun teacher and would help u out if you need it
6982,J  English,mr english was a great teacher the class is intimidating at first but he teaches it well and gives sufficient time to prepare speaches be prepared for a couple minute speeches toward the end though
6983,L  Assante,lectures are basically the reading assignments regurgitated sometimes add a few videos fun facts and personal stories to make them not too boring his quizzes too hard but his tests can be tricky he offers a lot of extra credit questions and makes his own memes though
6984,L  Assante,took this online over the week summer at first i would read the book and then take the test and would do poorly after that i just started to look the quizzes up on quizlet one group project which hard at all and their was a storytelling speech and a informative speech for the informative speech you have to have audience members
6985,L  Assante,great at relating all topics in class and is interesting in his lectures read the textbook for tests though
6986,L  Assante,mr assante is very clear about what he expects in the speeches that you give over the semester hes a very good speaker and even gave us a great motivational speech at the beginning of class
6987,L  Assante,mr assante gives very interesting lectures and explains topics well he has an easygoing personality and is willing to work with you in my public speaking class the three big things he expected of us when giving a speech is keep it simple clean and have your audience in mind
6988,L  Assante,i enjoyed class he was very helpful during the semester and i learned more than i thought i would
6989,L  Assante,one of my favorite classes at vol state i took his interpersonal communication class as an elective and i loved it he keeps the subject interesting and i love his style of teaching he can be a little sarcastic every now and then but still very nice and a very good teacher i would suggest taking him to anyone
6990,L  Assante,this guy is really cool as long as you do the assignments you will have no trouble making an a he lets you take the quizzes up to three times each and you only do speeches enjoy
6991,L  Assante,he was cool until the end of the semester when he started giving everybody bad grades for no reason group project was terrible take this class in person if ya can
6992,L  Assante,this guy is too cool easy quizzes easy exams easy speeches and group is the hardest part because of all the dimwits assigned in ur group need to buy the new edition book either easy a
6993,L  Assante,i took his online class this teacher is great he is very nice and understanding i would take him again anyday
6994,L  Assante,i took his online comm class and it was great everything is very organized with lots of details so it is very easy to see what you will be doing he gives weekly quizzes but you can take them up to times to get the best grade possible a few assignments here and there and big speeches that you must do great class great teacher
6995,L  Assante,mm he is hot fun interesting and easy class
6996,L  Assante,mr lyn is nice but he is soo liberal it is very annoying he is a democrat and wants to convert you into one just read his crazy bulletin board outside of his office his office has the sti always question authority watch out keep your head on and be converted into a person that is so open minded your brains fall comepletely out
6997,L  Assante,awesome guy great teacher i dreaded this subject and he actually made it fun take him
6998,L  Assante,took online class didnt really participate in online discussions only came on and did grades took a while to answer emails so the class ran itself speeches required with at least witnesses and a group project
6999,L  Assante,very straightforward knowledgeable and clear on the subject matter
7000,L  Assante,no comments
7001,L  Assante,i took him a couple of semesters back for the video class a lot of homework but he worked around my traveling which is always a plus in my book i am glad i get hit on though my it is better if girls take the video class instead
7002,L  Assante,a great teacher love him
7003,J  Scarbrough,horrible teacher
7004,J  Scarbrough,yes she is very knowledgable however is also condescending at times is known for embarrasing students in front of entire class and i wrote more essays in her communication class than i did in both of my eng classes would not recommend her she teaches communications but does not communicate how does that work
7005,J  Scarbrough,she was my fist teacher in almost ten years it was a pleasure to have her introduce me into the world of college she is kind funny and very helpfull she is very understanding and willing to help in anyway as long as you do what she asks a fun class
7006,J  Scarbrough,very knowledgeable very professional but killed us with the amount of homework
7007,D  Warner,great
7008,D  Warner,this was a fun class mr warner is a very animated person and clearly loves to teach i found myself cracking up quite a bit during his lectures and feeling very open in his class he is also extremely helpful with speech topics and emphasizes on wanting students to approach him with any questions comments or concerns they may have
7009,D  Warner,personality plus loved this guy you must use the book as the test materials are not all covered in class but all test questions are covered in the sample quizzes written set assignments do not always make sense but if you ask him clarify he built our class into a great team thought hate the class wrong
7010,D  Warner,i found him to be very animated and entertaining show up for class participate and take the online practice quizzes before his tests and you will do fine in his class the one negative i had with him is all his examples are church related so if your not a christian his examples wont make sense to you ask the right questions to get around that
7011,D  Warner,mr warner is not very clear on what exactly he wants on many assignments it seems like just hit or miss as to whether or not you happen to respond the way he wants on the sets he assigns with questions and answers not a super difficult class some said all you have to do is the work and you will receive an a but i disagree need book
7012,D  Warner,loved him he is a huge county guy and he is probably one of the most silliest guys in the world his class was more like high school eveyone got to know one another and him as well loved the atmosphere but the test are kinda hard he is for sure a great teacher
7013,D  Warner,he is awesome study your practice quizzes online and aced the test i really liked the book we used in class and warner is super animated i would recommend him to anyone great teacher
7014,D  Warner,great teacher quizzes are from samples he gives beforehand two speeches which he gives great preparation beforehand his entire class is mapped out for you in contents and you can work ahead on some things learned loads
7015,D  Warner,easy a if u study for instructon learn anything except from what read in the very unprepared to give speeches we spend anytime preparing them.warning he makes you go to the library to take your in you are taking a hybrid to save trips to the take him
7016,D  Warner,dr warner will give you all of the information you need to pass his class with a good grade you will need to prepare for his tests but he gives study questions with answers in advance prepare to give speeches during the semester
7017,D  Warner,i think annoying he can go from laughing hysterically one minute to mad and pissed the next the course is easy but at lot of his instruction is unclear and contradictory
7018,D  Warner,oh my goodness if you get an a in this class you have no one to blame but yourself he is enthusiastic about the material and knows his stuff everything is very clear about what is expected and whenall you have to do is do it online practice quizzes make tests easy i recommend him to everyone
7019,D  Warner,he is awesome
7020,D  Warner,he is a great teacher if you have questions he is easy to approach his tests are good and his class is great that is saying a lot since i had him for an class
7021,D  Warner,d warner is a great guy he tries his best to stay connected with students generation very helpful and tells you on day one what to do to pass his class easy assignments very fair and very entertaining he makes jokes and you can joke back he loves and welcomes the interaction anamated too
7022,D  Warner,dw was a great teacher he made most of the lecture interesting to listen to sometimes he would make the assignment seem harder then it really was if not a linear thinking type of person the class will be a little harder but hey i still got a b
7023,D  Warner,always helpful
7024,D  Warner,he is a very good teacher he really helped me prepare for my speeches i would take him again
7025,D  Warner,professor warner was great as a person however we spent the first to weeks in class going over how to post a bulletin i dont like when teachers waste time on meaningless things such as this he was always very helpful though in being clear about assignments and what needed to be studied for test
7026,D  Warner,i love mr warner you must take him he wants his students to do well he gives every opportunity to make good grades we even go over homework every class time so do the right thing all gotten are in his class you must take him he is very nice and welcoming you can totally tell he likes what he does take mr warner
7027,S  Sparkman,a joke of a teacher i didnt appreciate him and in a classroom setting he is awful
7028,S  Sparkman,the coolest teacher i have ever had everyone should take at least one of his classes
7029,S  Sparkman,great professor took this class online and it was very easy you video tape your speeches with an audience of at least people he grades fair also would definitely recommend
7030,S  Sparkman,took this class speech online and professor sparkman was great he was very thorough with his directions was glad to assist if needed
7031,S  Sparkman,great class mr sparkman is very flexible
7032,H  Espravnik,make sure you show up to class or you will fail he always clear on what looking for on tests so make sure you pay close attention and take notes the way he grades is very unorganized so ask him frequently or he tell you but maybe once or twice with the book you only need it for a list of definitions for one test only tests
7033,H  Espravnik,his class made me angry he wandered off topic a lot you even have to show up to know what was going on he barely paid attention to the students he often asked our opinions just to interrupt us tell us we were wrong then move on to the next opinion he was rude and made me not want to go into mass communications
7034,H  Espravnik,wow what can be said about mr e greatest professor he and i are good friends and i still deejay at wvcp
7035,H  Espravnik,mr e is a good teacher but i worked very hard and thought i had an easy a all of the exam etc i had it was to my surprise that my final grade for the semester was a b i was shocked i wanted to contact him to find out what happened but i have to take him this semester so i let it go but his class ruined my his mouth does cuss
7036,H  Espravnik,easy class he really do much we did not use the book much and he went over whatever would be on tests grades easy on speeches as long as you act like you care and seem like you are halfway prepared he expresses his liberal political views in class which got on my nerves along with the inappropriate language
7037,H  Espravnik,very cool guy mr e is the man
7038,H  Espravnik,mr e is the best
7039,H  Espravnik,no comments
7040,H  Espravnik,mr e rocks he will do anything for you if you ask except let you bring a drink even if it is closed into the studio we had a blast in his class
7041,H  Espravnik,mr e is one of the greatest teachers every had anywhere will bend over backwards to help you if he can

7044,D  Larsen,dr larsen knows her theater very knowledgeable about the course as expected however if you are not majoring in theater i highly recommend you look for another elective her class is for serious students who are up for a challenge good luck
7045,D  Larsen,i had her for american popular culture she expects a lot but really enjoys what she does and you learn a lot make sure you clarify what is on the syllabus though
7046,D  Larsen,avoid save yourself go to film this teacher is rude and thinks that her class is the only one you will be taking this semester.i have a gpa and got a d in this class i have written five papers and all of them are over words my final is pages anything less will result in a zero
7047,D  Larsen,she does make you do a lot of papers but what college is all about you have to do a lot of reading but there again what college is all about if you need help she will help you she gives extra credit she is a cool person not stuck up or anal at all she is very in to what she does theatre
7048,D  Larsen,this teacher thinks that theater is major and expects you to write a page play or perform a part of a play including costumes and more than one actor as your final project avoid at all costs
7049,D  Larsen,no comments
7050,D  Larsen,this lady is crazy she can go off on some interesting subjects the rebel of the school not kidding it was very difficult to get an in her class the assigments were confusing i was never really clear on what she really wanted you ha
7051,D  Larsen,challenging class only because so passionate about theater and wants you to at least appreciate it also wants you to write like a college student the typical volstate page paper cut it whine because a she wants you to write proper
7052,D  Larsen,challenging class only because so passionate about theater and wants you to at least appreciate it also wants you to write like a college student the typical volstate page paper cut it and a good thing whine because a prof
7053,D  Larsen,dr larsen is all about herself i took her for intro to theatre and i thought that i was a theatre major by the time i was finished with her papers and plays she told me that i would end up with a c and i recieved a d she chooses her in her class.she is knowledgeable about theatre but she is an awful instructor
7054,D  Larsen,not clear on what she is looking for on major assignments papers very harsh grader this was an intro class i feel that what we were being taught should have been more for a class on the history of theater i received a bbut i had to concentrate on this class more than any of my others
7055,D  Larsen,professor is clearly knowledgable and enthusiastic about subject however far too much emphasis was placed on writing for an intro class grading seemed entirely subjective i received on all papers not even though she would not tell me at all what to do better and what i did wrong
7056,D  Larsen,she is a really bad teacher her class is not interesting at all take at your own risk
7057,William  Skidmore,no comments
7058,William  Skidmore,very good to give individual help when needed very interesting person and a very good teaching technique two thumbs up
7059,William  Skidmore,lots of fun very helpful has lots of good stories had him for string ped and theory
7060,T  Cardona,she is a very sweet and helpful teacher she reads the chapter with the class for every chapter and lets you work together on most of the chapter test really not a hard class if you just read loved her would recommend to anyone
7061,S  Hargrove,i had her for college success she is a great professor she cares about her students she does give a lot of busy work but it is not hard we had to give or presentations during the semester all quizzes were open book i enjoyed this class got an a
7062,S  Hargrove,ms.hargrove is really cool she is very nice but i think she requires too much busy work she told us we would only have presention and we had to do throughout the semester
7063,S  Hargrove,this is a good class understanding and real laid back
7064,S  Hargrove,she give alot of homework but she made our class very enjoyable
7065,J  Jenkins,she is horrible please do not take her she makes you take tests over chapters and you have to have a passport which is money down the drain so many people dropped the class and failed
7066,J  Jenkins,she was a horrible teacher and always gave too much work and reading passport and chapters at a time for a test she is horrible
7067,J  Jenkins,i made an a in her class as long as you try she will help you.she does not like you coming into her class late
7068,J  Jenkins,she just gets really worked up on questions you ask and she is a very hard grader on essays and that class is all essay pretty much cant ask for help without her getting worked up
7069,B  Blankenship,good instructor really works with you if you understand materials tries to be fair and helpful
7070,B  Blankenship,very helpful keeps up with what you are doing and works with you
7071,B  Blankenship,no comments
7072,E  Lester,her tests cover a lot of material and she allows no additional resources those who have a good understanding of algebra would probably do okay in this class but if you struggled with algebra at all in high school do not take her online i have done fine in the other math courses i have taken but this class was too much i work fulltime
7073,E  Lester,i could imagine this class being difficult for those who struggle with math
7074,E  Lester,ms lester helped me test out of learning support classes through the summer bridge program a very nice lady and a very clear teacher she can come off as rude or condescending but honestly i think she means too
7075,E  Lester,i hardly ever went to class and still made an a she kind of makes you feel stupid when asking a question but she will answer it she really knows her stuff and is very good at explaining things i like math and i really did enjoy her class the few times that i went
7076,E  Lester,do not take this class if you want to be interrupted during a question learn more from doing the homework online than the teacher we never used book except for on the homework theres a few questions that are about the section but theyre no biggie not a fun class if youre someone who likes to do activities find another class
7077,E  Lester,i suggest her to anyone who wants to succeed in math
7078,E  Lester,and not helpful at all i would not suggest this proffesor to anyone who actually needs a teacher to teach them
7079,E  Lester,easy enough to understand if you pay attention to her example but has an attitude when students ask questions allow them to finish the question makes them feel stupid with her tone so they want to elaborate on what they are actually confused on if math come easily to you recommend a different instructor
7080,E  Lester,mrs.lester is not very helpful at all i do not recommend her especially if math is not your strong point
7081,E  Lester,although she is full of professor lester allows her attitude dominate infact intimedate the majority of students who already have a hurdle to overcome in mathematics let alone having to content with an unhappy short tempered controlling condescending overworked unhappy teacher i use the word teacher lightly
7082,E  Lester,ms lester is a great teacher math my favortie but she explains it so you can understand not a mean teacher she just take mess from students who want to learn and apply themseleves hates texting makes you get on the board sometimes but she is a wonderful instructor and will help you i would take her again
7083,E  Lester,she was a really great teacher i am not good at math and i hate the math lab program but she taught very well
7084,E  Lester,took the time to make sure everyone understands speaks slowly and concisely so that you have time to absorb the information got an a without any problems
7085,E  Lester,took this class during the summer and would not recommend you do the same unless you are willing to work hard she used mymathlab for homework and quizzes plan on doing lots of busy work online however it really helps you learn algebra if you work hard show up and text in class you will make it
7086,E  Lester,ok at first she was an ok teacher then towards the end she took a turn for the worse i finished with a which is failing and i was pts away from passing but she is not willing to help me so i am failing and i am having to take this class again this summer
7087,E  Lester,she is very helpful if you need help she is willing you get a on homework as long as you do them
7088,E  Lester,uses my math lab so if you dont have alot of spare time do not take.she is a very good teacher she hates people who are slackers sleeps in class or texts in class.if you dont do that then you should be fine
7089,E  Lester,you can go never go to this class a day in your life and be just the same she uses my mathlab which i found to be very annoying i spent hours on homework in the semester which only accounts for of your overall grade i spent another hours on quizzes which are of your grade so unless you have a ton of time i wouldnt take her
7090,E  Lester,she was okay teacher she do well in teaching the math she would get attitudes at times and i got a c in that class even after to doing good on all my test and homework recommend her
7091,E  Lester,i love ms lester and all things she thought me however i believe she could be a lil more explanatory and lil bit easier test but over she was a good teacher
7092,Wayne  Hawthorn,had a blast in his course the course was well structured he was passionate about teaching and cared a lot about the students unfortunatly this was his last year at uw
7093,Wayne  Hawthorn,great prof the material is lengthy but easy leave the studying to the end it is alot to cover
7094,Wayne  Hawthorn,wayne was such a great prof he had no patience for stupidity and made sure to help students any way possible such as by posting notes on teh internet or providing clarification the assignments are easy if you read the text very informative i just wish he told off the morons in class
7095,Wayne  Hawthorn,amazing professor always willing to help and really cares about his students the lectures are really interesting and entertaining hes a bouncy professor definatly take another class he teaches
7096,Wayne  Hawthorn,if interested in plants agriculture pigs cows and chickens then take this course assignments are long but marked pretty easily no midterm exam is not bad interesting but can sometimes completely lose you
7097,Wayne  Hawthorn,man this guy is boring his classes are simple very judgemental if your not a biology major thinks your a waste of space unless you have a major
7098,Wayne  Hawthorn,awesome guy a good teacher and an entertaining one too he loves to bounce around up front very intelligent and insignful and very helpful a fair marker too

7108,D  Long,this guy is hilarious i just finished a semester with him i wish he taught the next course of math i have to take
7109,D  Long,i bet the previous post is from the girl who had already failed his class once and probably failed again he was without question the best math teacher i have ever had at any level the few phone calls he had were because of his level of responsibility with his full time job they were few and far between students took calls if needed also
7110,D  Long,you girls need better taste in men he was always taking calls from work which intrupted class made it hard to follow that cd you got he knew nothing about it there were in the library that were easier than he was i never showed you any short cuts for the work he was usually late for class up to a half an hour or so i was notimpressed
7111,D  Long,great teacher always makes class laugh and is gret to look at i wish i could take him for more classes
7112,D  Long,good teacher he is always trying to make the class laugh
7113,D  Long,he makes class fun and is easy to understand
7114,D  Long,for a guy in his forties got great eyes thinks a comedian but at least upbeat and makes class fun while learning
7115,S  Seats Jr,he is an awesome instructor he explained things well and through in a few jokes here and there to make it interesting i would definitely consider taking in algebra class
7116,S  Seats Jr,santa clause is a awesome teacher
7117,S  Seats Jr,i hate math and it hates me but mr seat explains thing that makes it easy to understand i took him for elem alge and would of took him again for inter alge but he was teaching in leb and i did not want to drive that far.he require you to do homework it is just practice for you all of his test is submitted on to an a on the test
7118,S  Seats Jr,act like he didnt care and didnt want to be there
7119,S  Seats Jr,very easy teacher doesnt take a whole lot of effort to pass his class not a boring teacher would most definately recommend for a teacher
7120,K  McFadden,great great all i can say i hate math and did good in her class because she goes step by step in everything she is fun to look at because she is different so she always has your attention her last name mafadden anymore i know what it is know

7131,Vicente  Lombrana,note i only had mr lombrana for the lab part not the instruction part he is a cool guy laid back and is very clear on all his instructions no tricks with this guy he tells you exactly what he wants
7132,Vicente  Lombrana,the use of your notes in very important study your notes very good and detailed and you will pass a teacher in my book he will always work with you if anyting comes up in co bsn program and i will still refer to his notes

7144,J  Lowe,so boring i could have hung myself in his class he sounds like the guy for those commercials asking if you have dry red ichy eyes us these eyes drops he is boring if you want to keep your sanitiy do not take this class
7145,J  Lowe,boring
7146,J  Lowe,mr lowe is bay far the best prof i had while at vscc it always makes him self available and is great even outside the classroom
7147,J  Lowe,mr lowe is not only a very intellegent engineer and a good teacher but a very good person as well he will go out of his way to make sure you understand the material and his office door is always open i highly recommend him not that you have a choice the only engineering teacher at volstate
7148,Todd  McDonald,mcmcdonald was a great teacher he wanted you to succeed and was extremely helpful i am an adult student and struggle in math and he never made me feel like i do it take him for all of my math classes if i could i had to drop at the end of the semester due to other issues and will take him again if he is teaching
7149,Todd  McDonald,great professor only thing that got me through college algebra was having todd for elementary and intermediate
7150,Todd  McDonald,i loved him.very cool.willing to stay late and help those who need it and teaches slowly and patiently.even lets you call him us feel like he was a friend tutoring us rather than a prof math is not my subject but he was totally cool and very helpful and his tests are pretty
7151,Todd  McDonald,todd is a really good teacher
7152,Todd  McDonald,he is a great teacher makes learning fun and is willing to stay late to help you get it one of my favorite teachers so far
7153,Todd  McDonald,the best teacher i have ever had take him and you will not regret thanks todd
7154,Todd  McDonald,mr mcdonald puts the fun in mafunmatics i highly recommend d
7155,Todd  McDonald,i took elem.algrebra twice and this is my second time taking int.algr.i wish had knew mr.mcdonald when i took elem.al he is the bomb and explains everything where it makes sense he also curves test grades everytime take him and you be sorry the best
7156,Todd  McDonald,this is the best professor to take if math is hard for you he is very helpful extremely generous when grading and truly wants you to understand the material i would definetely recommend this class to anyone who has a little trouble in math
7157,Todd  McDonald,amazing man anyone who has been out of school a while should take him and he is very pleasing on the eyes
7158,Todd  McDonald,he is not an easy teacher but he is very helpful considerate and funny i learned how to like math bec of him he encourages students to ask questions and explains things in simple and clear manner.students who are scared of math should take him he is the best teacher ever
7159,Todd  McDonald,mr.mcdonald is a wonderful teacher he is such a pleasure to be around he has a way of making algebra make sense he is by far one of my favorite teachers in all my years of school
7160,Todd  McDonald,the todd is the man i am sure that if i had had him as a math teacher earlier in life i would be a rocket scientist by now
7161,Todd  McDonald,great teacher he knew how to push me to reach my potential he always offered help before and after class for those who wanted it his tests were easy if you studied for them i wish he was not limited to just math he would be great in other subjects as well he relates with his students since he has been there before
7162,Todd  McDonald,todd is the best teacher you could ever want to have if algebra has always been difficult for you.it matter if everyone in the class is getting it and you always take the time to make sure you understand before you leave his class he rocks
7163,Todd  McDonald,awesome teacher he does whatever it takes to help you succeed
7164,Todd  McDonald,todd makes learning algebra fun and i learned a lot from him he always takes the time to help anyone who needs it so they understand how you get from one step to the next
7165,Todd  McDonald,wonderful professor
7166,Todd  McDonald,i totally learned alot from this class i have always had a hard time getting math but not with this teacher
7167,Todd  McDonald,i took elementary algebra in newskills and thought that was good well mr mcdonald teaches the class better than the little cds on the computer in newskills i have the cds at home and i learn more from him than i do with the cds i have learned and retained more from his teachings
7168,Kathy  Butler,she seems really nice so far i think like her
7169,Kathy  Butler,no comments
7170,K  McLean,if you plan on taking this course and then transferring to another school and follow up with french you will be very very behind i learned this the hard way when i went to mtsu
7171,K  McLean,she is kind of scatterbrained and unorganized but she will go out of her way to help you if you are having problems with the language
7172,K  McLean,very scatterbrained kinda unorganzied but very nice and helpful
7173,K  McLean,she is very helpful at times she is also very funny but she can also be dingy
7174,K  McLean,she doesnt really teach on a beginners level for beginners french shes a nice lady but her thoughts are always scattered and confusing she repeats herself alot so we basically went over the same thing every day which got frustrating as she was assigning other things but was still explaining some of the first things we went over in class
7175,K  McLean,very scatterbrained often waits until five minutes of class are left before handing out quiz will review information that already been over twenty times for the benefit of one student
7176,K  McLean,great teacher
7177,K  McLean,holy crap what are thinkin i love this woman her class was so frickin easy and she loves class discussions homework was minimal and he grades fairly easy oh man if i was still at vscc i would take her in a heartbeat awesome teacher
7178,K  McLean,terrible english is my best subject sh etried to destroy that she was more concerned about you writing about her view points than your own
7179,K  McLean,she is so nice but so scattered brained
7180,Nancy  Edwards,everyday i left with a migraine horrible her voice makes me want to cringe i believe i have to take more classes with her for the ece major
7181,Nancy  Edwards,nancy is great she is one of those professors that you either love her or hate her you have to be open to constructive criticism and take her advice when she gives it to you go to her for resources not only will she see your trying but get good grades nancy knows what talking about so take her seriously she can be a tough cookie
7182,Nancy  Edwards,nancy is a nice person and really wants you to understand the material in regards to the comments on her being mean and rude i did witness that but i think it is one of those things where if you nag her and get on her bad side you stay on her bad side just do the work be nice and ask questions and remember she is a person just like us
7183,Nancy  Edwards,seriously the best teacher i have ever had i would totally recommend taking her classes very helpful always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand everything very giving and wants everyone to do well love this lady
7184,Nancy  Edwards,she was horribly rude and mean to everyone in the class i hated going to her class and often went home feeling like i wanted to cry her dealines are all over the place and she is less then helpful when asked a question that is when she doesnt put you down she told my whole class that we should drop out because we are going to make bad teachers
7185,Nancy  Edwards,she is a fabulous teacher who is extremely nice i have two classes with her this semester and have not heard one mean thing from her mouth she is a very smart woman and i actually learned something in these classes
7186,Nancy  Edwards,she is the worst teacher i have ever had she will embarass you put you down and make you afraid to ask questions because of the nasty responses you get she is rude and nasty and unhelpful i dreaded going to her class and so did the rest of the class unfortunately for educ majors having her as a teacher is unavoidable so be prepared

7194,Nancy  Edwards,no comments
7195,A  Osaitile,i loved professor osaitile he was very sweet and really cared about his students and explained things a lot if someone still understand this was byfar my favorite class he is such a sweetheart and love him he is really big on participation and gives out a ton of points at the end of the semester that really help your grade
7196,A  Osaitile,personally this class was the easiest i tell you that he gives points out like skittles prior to this class i did hear that he was very hard he is not he is strict tho when it comes to directions but i passed with an pretty funny and easy going guy he wants you to succeed it does get annoying whn he asks to read frm the book use a lot
7197,A  Osaitile,professor osaitile is not easy but he is more than fair you have to follow all of his instructions the devil is in the details if you participate in class follow the instructions and show up for every class you will do well i learned a lot from his class and most of it was paying attention to what i have been asked to do
7198,A  Osaitile,used to be my best subject but very professor he means well but honestly the language barrier was an issue and his grading was ridiculous he handed back a paper times to fix without past page so i never knew what to work on and got bad grade anyways talking to him was no help he acted like i was stupid
7199,A  Osaitile,excellent instructor is not easy but makes class fun lots of writing did not lik group essay but all else fairly easy some but great class
7200,A  Osaitile,he is not an easy teacher and comes off as harsh at first but he is extremely helpful he deeply cares about his students and wants them to do well as long as you follow his instructions for the assignment you will do well he is always open for questions i would definitely recommend taking his class
7201,A  Osaitile,a good instructor highly recommendable for eng class if you want to make an a he also dash out points in order to help you have good grade he is good
7202,A  Osaitile,a very good instructor he is highly recommendable for english courses
7203,A  Osaitile,not an easy class but if you do the assignments just as he has instructed you to do you will do fine if you have questions about his grading just ask him about it he deeply cares about his students especially those that care about their education participate in class to get bonus points they really add up at the end of the semester
7204,A  Osaitile,nice guy easy a i suck at writing and hate english and i got an a only did papers instead of the normal gave everyone in class a on a paper just for having it on time even grade it gives points at the end of the year for perfect attendance very easy
7205,A  Osaitile,he is so great he comes off as harsh at first after a few class days one will notice that he is a fantastic instructor that really cares about his students many of his assignments are easy and fun
7206,A  Osaitile,he is definitely not easy so if you are looking for a bird class do not take his class however if you are interested in learning the fundamentals so that you can write college level papers i strongly recommend him he seems harsh at first but the more you get to know him and joke with him the better the experience will be for you
7207,A  Osaitile,strict and follow his own syllabus rules very thick accent and yells at students like we are stupid little children overstates obvious things like we comprehend
7208,A  Osaitile,mr osaitile is an awesome instructor he makes everything relatable and fun his grading is kinda strict but he is fair he expects you to turn everything in on time but will give extentions is he thinks you deserve them overall i would recommend him to anyone
7209,A  Osaitile,at first he appears harsh and rigid.but as time goes on you will begin to understand him better he really does care about students just take the time to show you care so funny and just down to earth really big on respect more so than other teachers overall the course is clear and not too difficult at all oh and follow directions
7210,A  Osaitile,if you want a nigerian english teacher who has an extremely thick accent and does not know the english language very well then sure he is not fair helpful or clear any paper you turn in is not good enough oh and he likes to yell at the class like they are unruly children do not take his class
7211,A  Osaitile,he is so picky about the papers and his grading scale makes no sense he is always changing something around and he pretty much murders any work you turn into him
7212,A  Osaitile,i would not take this guy his grading is all over the place and he judges your work based on his ideals take someone else you do well in his classes
7213,A  Osaitile,gives a rough first impression to be honest i hated him after the first class but as i got to know him he is a great instructor a little hard to understand as he is from nigeria but overall not that big of a deal as long as you try to write a good paper you have any problems with him he does not like flashy papers keep it simple
7214,A  Osaitile,great teacher u want to take this class
7215,C  Malden,she has a hunger to teach everyone well she deeply cares about education and wants to make sure everyone learns the material she teaches great she gives plenty of time to complete assignments she also works with you to help you get a better grade if needed manageable workload easy grading one of my favorite teachers yet
7216,C  Malden,this was one of my toughest professors at volstate i had her for american literature so obviously i had to read before every class period i also had to write journal entries for each reading assignment do the journals last minute you will have to compile them into a folder to turn in you always have to participate in class
7217,C  Malden,i loved mrs malden because of her sarcastic sense of humor but the class for me was pretty hard we had four papers going on at once and it very organized so i was left confused a lot she is very strict on her grading so take the time on your papers or you will end up failing if you miss more than classes your grade goes down a grade
7218,C  Malden,overall she is a pretty good teacher as long as you read and do the work get an a i learned a lot in this class we only had to write one essay do one seek assignment and take three quizzes do the work and show up and be fine
7219,C  Malden,ms malden is a very good teacher if you do the reading and other assignments you will get the grade earned
7220,C  Malden,i hated english and mrs malden when i first got to her class but her hard knock life teaching made me a better student
7221,C  Malden,i learned a lot in this class that at the time i did find realinteresting but realized later how useful this information is if you do your work it hard to get an a
7222,C  Malden,she is not a great instructor what so ever
7223,C  Malden,she is a very good english teacher i had her twice the grade you work for will be the grade that you earn
7224,C  Malden,no comments
7225,Roberta  Reynolds,she goes off topic a lot one time in class we were discussing about literature and then all of a sudden we were talking about cinderella
7226,Roberta  Reynolds,she talks a lot and most of the time after classes you will wonder why you even went her class is very easy and laid back and i never got anything less than a b attendance is not mandatory and she cancels class a lot of the time
7227,Roberta  Reynolds,reynolds does not lecture and give clear lessons about how to write effectively or interpret the literature she assigns this is a selfstudy class you must learn on your own assignments are vague and unclear you only learn what she wants after she returns your work very hard grader learned little about writing in this class avoid
7228,Roberta  Reynolds,i loved her im defintley taking her again shes incredibly sweet and has really good advice and will help you with anything you need coming into csm from another school was hard so i felt so relieved when she helped answer many of my questions fair amount of essays but topics are fun and relatable research but she walks you through it
7229,Roberta  Reynolds,very nice and understanding but the only form of teaching is by talking and rambling for an hour says obviously at the end of every other sentence when nothing is actually obvious goes off topic a lot but does get material in she is very open to helping you with your work
7230,Roberta  Reynolds,if you want to waste an hour of your day or you just need a place to sleep i recommend this class because just sit there and listen to her ramble on until you forget the topic of the discussion she is a nice person and can speak of good topics but at the end of the day wonder why you even went to class that day
7231,Roberta  Reynolds,reynolds is the best super sweet helpful easy class very accommodating to late papers
7232,Roberta  Reynolds,was not a good teacher
7233,Roberta  Reynolds,was not a good experience
7234,Roberta  Reynolds,one of her creative writing students i love roberta smart funny and sweet and understanding not in love with the class always not her fault the class the talent level varies wildly and i feel like we focus on the poor writers significantly more like a higher level of talent in the class
7235,Roberta  Reynolds,there are essays you have to do throughout the semester a few grammar tests classes finish early woohoo she helps a lot during the process of writing the essay just make sure you use her help in editing your drafts and what not not a tough grader but you need to submit all essays grading is also very clear
7236,Roberta  Reynolds,i actually would take her again because personally enjoyed writing her papers taken her for engl and currently engl your grade is based on five essays and you skip one at all the topics were easy so writing the papers were a cakewalk instructions for essays were straightforward basically just do all of your work
7237,Roberta  Reynolds,easiest class ever taken must i say more just make sure you do all your poetry and there are only long papers you have to do other than that just a poem a week
7238,Roberta  Reynolds,there are three essays and final is a presentation attendance is not mandatory professor reynolds is pretty easy in grading all readings are in the textbook
7239,Roberta  Reynolds,weird but not hard i say that her class was interesting or i learned a lot but i can say that her class was definitely not difficult really weird but she can sometimes be interesting i think some people are judging her too hard on here
7240,Roberta  Reynolds,reynolds is weird she gives you relatively easy papers to write you write them alone and turn them in on the day they are due the only time i went to class was for the first two weeks and thereafter only to turn in my papers or have a grading conference this teacher is not for anyone who is not self motivated
7241,Roberta  Reynolds,dr reynolds was a peculiar teacher that did not really lecture much at all after the first few weeks of the semester her essays were not too difficult but she did not really help explain how to go on about writing them it felt like a self study course with class visits just to turn in the assignments i ended up with a b in the class
7242,Roberta  Reynolds,a great person and teacher she might weird you out on the first day but the first day i ended up liking her a lot allows you to manage your working time and recommend what you should have done obviously a due date for the essays typically excepts work after deadline but push it
7243,Roberta  Reynolds,this is probably the only professor that will answer any question a student has with the correct answer and most importantly without the text if you are a serious student and want a teacher that fully understands the subject they are teaching i highly suggest you take this class
7244,Roberta  Reynolds,this professor is one of finest she works with her students so they understand the material she goes out of her way to give students feedback about their work she knows what she is talking about when teaching class even without the text i learned a lot from her a better writer because of her
7245,Judy  Navas,judy is kind of crazy this class is very easy but its painful to sit through no homework so nice but kind of all over the place not sure if actually worked with children before but an easy a
7246,Judy  Navas,this class is very easy a short essay every other week and a few in class group projects judy is always mins late to class and often cancels class she is unorganized and her on the board and in prompts is terrible but if she like your wording in your paper she will mark you an entire letter grade down
7247,Judy  Navas,judy is very clear about what she expects if you do the work which very hard as long as you pay attention you will do well she is very sweet and the classes were decent to sit through if i were a thar major take more classes from her
7248,Judy  Navas,judy is generally a few minutes late to class but she always gives an overview of what to expect in class that day helpful if you have questions the plays and movies are fun if you involve yourself otherwise you might drift off the essays are easy if you just sit down and do them otherwise they pile up quick super nice lady
7249,Judy  Navas,judy is such an amazing lady and all who have commented here know what talking about this was my second class with her and i feel as though i have taken so much out of both classes she really allows you to be creative and opinion means the world to her she truly means well its noticable how much she cares
7250,Judy  Navas,she comes to class late and lot of cancel classes got on all her assignments and got an a in the class not really helpful outside of class attendent is helpful because she changes the assigment all the time
7251,Judy  Navas,not very enjoyable judy is always late easy a though
7252,Judy  Navas,the easiest teacher ever she cancels a lot of classes definitely an easy a class is a joke highly recommend taking her
7253,Judy  Navas,judy navas is underqualified as a professor at ssu as a fine arts instructor a certain degree of literacy is expected and ms navas seems to be void of such ability constant spelling errors and grammatical mishaps in her essay prompts mispronunciation of words and a disappointing level of difficulty has made her class unbearable avoid
7254,Judy  Navas,talk about the easiest class ever but not only is it easy but i found it to be quite interesting if she assigns a paper the class has a discussion about it so that everyone is on the same page she is an enjoyable lady i think this is the easiest a1 category class there is take this class
7255,Judy  Navas,if you want an easy class that meets ge requirements then this is for you especially if your other classes are hard nice and flexible often late often cancels easy to impress her final is a fun puppet show sometimes tedious the lateness got old too but i liked the class overall
7256,Judy  Navas,judy is very nice but frsutrating professor she didnt show up for many classes and was late for the ones she did make classes are a breeze and an absolute must for upper ge
7257,Judy  Navas,class was easy and interesting her class consisted of showing up and enjoy the movie then go home and write a discussion paragraph within your group members online we only had to write couple papers during the entire semester just explain what you think of textbooks judy deserves some respect from her ppl were rude
7258,Judy  Navas,i must say that i agree with all of the posts everyone has done i was a ta for her class and she not only sloughed everything off on us including the grading but she posted the grades we gave her late wreaking havoc on my financial aid really this is a dangerous situation for serious students or anyone wanting to learn
7259,Judy  Navas,no comments
7260,Judy  Navas,always late and scatterbrained the group projects were fun when you write papers for her she grades horribly told us to write an opinion paper one pagethen commented that i had too much personal opinion and needed to add more fact to make it longer i get straight in all upper division hutchins courses and she gives me on papers
7261,Judy  Navas,this class was horrible and needs a new format i love theatre and acting but i dreaded going to this class it was a waste of my time and energy
7262,Judy  Navas,absolutely awful she is the most horrible teacher and has a dumbass aid jerod who cannot hear and marked people absent when they biggest waste of time she should be fired
7263,Judy  Navas,gotten better now that she has hearing aides a bit scatterbrained though nice and you make alot of puppets but you might not learn alot she really likes woody allen
7264,Judy  Navas,an easy a but i say i really learned anything about theater i already know and i knew very little going in wrote papers pages double spaced maximum and did skits one of which was on a childrens story bother paying for the reading download them or get them from someone else again easy a
7265,B  Dennis,he makes everything very clear and very easy i enjoyed his class and i hate to write
7266,B  Dennis,dr d is the best i had him in high school and he was the nicest man ever
7267,Bohdan  Oppenheim,he is never wrong try to ask him something on a test why it is wrong he wont admit he made a mistake in grading.even took it to another teacher and said that it was right so if you make a mistake always your fault because you didnt learn the material supposedly
7268,Bohdan  Oppenheim,ok teacher but just dont even bother asking why you got points taken off or to explain what was wrong in a problem has favorite students and favors them in grading
7269,Bohdan  Oppenheim,really difficult class but you will learn a lot memorizing all the equations is challenging but hopefully one day it pay off you work hard on the homework and minitest and he rewards you with a reasonably easy final if you study hard
7270,Bohdan  Oppenheim,no comments
7271,Bohdan  Oppenheim,very interesting class this tacher knows his stuff you will learn things in this class that you learn anywhere else great guy very helpfull
7272,Bohdan  Oppenheim,not the easiest class but hes a great teacher who teaches you a lot
7273,Bohdan  Oppenheim,great teacher very smart he really knows his stuff you can learn a lot from him watch out for those minitests though and you have to memorize all equations he is one of the best teachers at lmu
7274,Mei-ling  Wang,awesome
7275,Mei-ling  Wang,soo easy dont know how her grading system work because i got on the study but still got an a for the course but dont let that deter
7276,Mei-ling  Wang,all wang does in this class is just talk about current events you actually learn anything about intercultural communication but at least semiinformed about what goes on in the world class is pretty easy with a few easy assignments and a midterm and a final
7277,Mei-ling  Wang,dr wang is an excellent teacher very interesting bases majority of grade on group and individual projects and loves anything you say or do definitely would reccommend
7278,Mei-ling  Wang,she is crazy thats what is cool about her
7279,Mei-ling  Wang,if you want an a in this class you just have to do the work it even matter if the worst public speaker ever because wang understands and she likes to give everyone a good grade besides the quizzes are straight from back tests and you need a book for the class above all a riot and class is actually fun at times
7280,Mei-ling  Wang,she is seriously a very intelligent woman she will keep ya entertained for hours with her stories about her trips to geneva paris australia switzerland i dont think theres a place this woman hasnt been to knows the subject def recommend
7281,Mei-ling  Wang,i think with wang the engine is running but nobody is behind the wheel
7282,Mei-ling  Wang,wang is super a bit of a looney tune but ok i got a on the first test but still did well in the class go to her office take care of you
7283,Mei-ling  Wang,wang is cool and she has a good approtch to in class presentations where some teachers would corner the students into a political discussion wang allows student to choose any topic and can be creative with it which in my oppinion is the better way to go
7284,Mei-ling  Wang,no comments
7285,Mei-ling  Wang,ahh everything is wonderful for her very funny but i have no idea what talking about
7286,Mei-ling  Wang,she is the best teacher in the world if u want an easy a take her please physio is going to kill u
7287,Ilya  Vinitskiy,he was very good
7288,Ilya  Vinitskiy,the class material was interesting and he was always available for extra credit was made available a really nice person and probably one of my favorite professors
7289,Lawrence  Orihuela,dr o is the best professor ever he keeps you interested at all times even at saturday morning he is what teaching is all about an inspiration i hope half as good as he is when a teacher i hope he teaches more classes in the future
7290,Lawrence  Orihuela,best prof ever you will learn a lot it is an inspirational class he is one of those teachers who is difficult to find these days if you want a great experience and well developed phylosophy when teaching take his class in my professional life i would always remember dr orihuela
7291,Lawrence  Orihuela,very inspirational professor made the class interesting and fun fiu should definitely keep him i never met anyone who truly loves and enjoys educating people the class is easy but you must put in work the teaches are fun and you learn a lot from them i will miss prof o and his class soo much best prof ever
7292,Lawrence  Orihuela,dr.o is the greatest professor ever i am honestly depressed that the semester is over you will learn so much from him and there is never a dull moment in class lots of fun and always keeps your attention i recommend him for any class you can take him with sweetest man too
7293,Lawrence  Orihuela,one of the most knowledgeable and caring professors ever
7294,Lawrence  Orihuela,he is an easygoing professor very clear in what he requires which is not a lot he keeps the class entertained and awake i strongly recomend him
7295,Lawrence  Orihuela,amazing professor one of the few professors that has left an everylasting impression i learned so much in his class he makes everything interesting however the class does require a lot of assignments but do them and not care he is just that awesome you have labs where you need to prepare teaches intimidating but a wonderful exp
7296,Lawrence  Orihuela,he is the best professor i ever had i wish he taught more classes he is and very inspiring go to class and do good on tests i promise i learned a lot in this class the labs are not hard depends on your instructor they are very helpful i never missed one of his classes if you want to learn take him prof.o is the best
7297,Lawrence  Orihuela,very inspiring professor class is entertaining attendance is not mandatory but go to class or you will fail midterm is hard other assignments are easy teaches are nervewracking at first but easy once you get the hang of it group a has less time to prepare teach but everyone has the same amount of time to prepare the others
7298,Lawrence  Orihuela,prof o is amazing he is such an inspiring teacher and knows what he is teaching the course requires time consuming assignments the teaches but he makes it very doable awesome if you need to take this course definitely with him
7299,Lawrence  Orihuela,prof o is such an inspirational teacher i love being in his class learned more from him than any of my other teachers ever i really enjoyed his enthusiasm and charisma he clearly is passionate about what he does i hope fiu wises up and hires him full time i think he would be an exceptional grad school professor bravo prof o
7300,Lawrence  Orihuela,excellent professor you must attend class if not you will not pass makes class intresting the teaches are a lot easier than you think there are only and the groups are small you are allowed to help each other out overall a very helpful class
7301,Lawrence  Orihuela,awesome teacher but you must show up to class thats where you get prepared for your teaches he is very passionate and knows what works trust it midterm was difficult on blooms taxonomy but over all easy the teaches were easy as well not mention kinda fun
7302,Lawrence  Orihuela,awesome teacher he is great i totally recomend him and i wish he taught more courses the teaches are a bit nervewrecking depending on your lab instructor luckily i got a great one take his class
7303,Lawrence  Orihuela,attendance is tells you what he wants and how he wants it.midterm a bit is essay format.you are required to teach in a group setting.the teaches can be difficult depending on your lab instructor some can be very picky make sure your teach group interacts your grade depends on them helping you and asking the right questions
7304,Lawrence  Orihuela,very good professor knows his subject very well willing to help you it is very hard not to pass this class the teaches are a bit nervewrecking but it gets better very inspirational guy as well
7305,Lawrence  Orihuela,he provides you with great practical information for teaching strategies he is fun articulate and knowledgeable the classes require quite a bit of work and the midterm and final are tough
7306,Lawrence  Orihuela,i guess he is a good teacher definately better than the majority of ed profs at fiu but he is extremely cocky and most of the lectures are spent listening to him explain how he is the greatest teacher ever he is extremly opinionated and doesnt allow for students to have their own opinion pertaining to ed also the labs are unfair be in group b
7307,Lawrence  Orihuela,super nice professor you will learn alot from him the labs are a bit difficult if you are in group a because you only have one week to prepare each lab and group b has but he knows his stuff and is entertaining really cares about giving you useful information
7308,Lawrence  Orihuela,above all a great person he is a great teacher his class is educational and entertaining great sense of humor i wish he taught other classes my best fiu professor to date
7309,Darwin  Davis,she was awesome when she taught here she had the most interesting classes she was fair with the students and she was really concerned about equality and social justice the kids at this school were too concerned about doing what their and told them to do to understand what she was teaching awesome
7310,Darwin  Davis,no comments
7311,Darwin  Davis,stand hertells you her ultra liberal ideas are fact and if you try to argue and discuss like a normal classroom atmosphere she gets extremely upset and tells u u are wrong and whoever told u that is wrong today in class she said only white people can be and only males be she also said that if bush were black he would hav
7312,Darwin  Davis,terrible
7313,Darwin  Davis,i found darwin to be extremely unqualified for teaching this class though she knows her english we very seldomly actually did english i feel that if i am mandated to take a class like i was with this english class then i should be learning english and not just discussing her life as a teen
7314,Darwin  Davis,shes fun and interesting and her sons adorable
7315,Gary  Toller,i really liked the class first time i did well in a science class the tests were tough the oral presentations were easy
7316,Gary  Toller,course integrates many science areas clear book can handle the tests because each covers only chapters like the prof graded fairly provided extra credit knew our names and emphasized concepts over memorization
7317,Gary  Toller,good science course for nonscience majors just follow the syllabus
7318,Gary  Toller,into it and i learned a lot
7319,Gary  Toller,old tests are available for study view them gives extra credit too on line quizzes and group labs not much math
7320,Gary  Toller,wait till we find another earth_ interesting class
7321,Gary  Toller,just finished astrobiology for nonmajors many of us thought it was our favorite class of the semester interesting topics and labs
7322,Gary  Toller,demanding but provides many opportunities to learn and earn a decent grade many group labs
7323,Gary  Toller,the universe is amazing
7324,Gary  Toller,i took this class my senior year and i was a physics major i hated it so boring i didnt pay attention or do any of the work a waste
7325,Gary  Toller,no comments
7326,Gary  Toller,thought his class was great just do the reading and be fine study guides are most of what will be on tests good class studied well and got an a
7327,Gary  Toller,hard but not impossible when he tells you to study the past exams that are on reserve do yourself a favor and study the past exams they will help you i promise
7328,Gary  Toller,a nice guy very interesting class tough but doable
7329,Gary  Toller,very nice man but prides himself on making his class soo imposible the tests suck the labs suck and if your not a science major dont waste your time with these classes he is pissed off people take his class as an easy sci credit and he slaps them for that by making work impossible
7330,Gary  Toller,taking this class for non science majors is a joke i failed the first test though i got on all the labs he gives a lot of extra credit but not enough when the tests are impossible and worth most of your grade it was a mistake to take this class as a gsc take this class
7331,Gary  Toller,very nice intelligent man but the labs are impossible including things not covered in class not allowed to work with anyone on them the material is ridiculous the only one who understands his clarifications do not take this class
7332,Gary  Toller,my goodness i just want to sleep through his class if i slepy with my book probably learn more then by going to his class the labs make no sense so please do me a favor take astronomy with him begging you
7333,Gary  Toller,horrible horrible worst teacher i have ever had in my life he just repeats things from the book and then gives extremely confusing labs that he explain how to do nor does he ever clarify the correct way to do them.you learn anything
7334,Gary  Toller,not horrible the course itself is pretty interesting study its hard to pull an a off in this class but if good at be fine really nice otherwise
7335,Julie  Geiger,scatterbrained at times but she knows what she is doing come out of her classes knowing a lot more than when you came in you just have to be willing to do the work and there is a lot of it if you have a good attitude about the class get an a
7336,Julie  Geiger,i think the class would have been better if she remembered that it was an introduction to costuming for someone who had never sewed before it was a lot of work even if i tried my hardest it got to the point where she was moving so fast i would never have been able to catch up especially since she is pretty unhelpful at times
7337,Julie  Geiger,most fun classes ever julie is an awesome teacher and anyone who thinks otherwise needs their head checked
7338,Julie  Geiger,julie is great anyone who disagrees is just jealous or very insecure about themselves she shops for costuems for shows you morons not herself had her for other classes too and been nothing but professional and fun
7339,Julie  Geiger,no comments
7340,Julie  Geiger,she is very nice she tries real hard to do well to her students she is still learning with us
7341,Julie  Geiger,she went shopping during class one time and expected us to stay the whole time to sew costumes
7342,Julie  Geiger,she was incredibly unhelpful does not care about the difficulty or amount of effort put into your final project she plays her phone messages from her boyfriend really loud so the students will hear them and think cool very tacky
7343,Dinora  Cardoso,class as entertaining as the disscusions of the topic which at times were trite but she does try to apply the class to modern day and mix up topics history politics culture pop quizes on the readings but they tough eases up around finals watching movies in spanish i would recomend but also depends on how interested your classmate
7344,Dinora  Cardoso,pretty though i think she expects a lot but you will learn in her class her tests are pretty easy all you have to do is pay attention to class discussions and do well on the tests
7345,Dinora  Cardoso,no comments
7346,Dinora  Cardoso,she impossible but she does expect a lot i was surprised that the class was taught in spanglish at the level worry too much about the readings she will go over all of them in class if you have an answer to her question no big deal because she prefers her interpretation lord of the rings and har
7347,Dinora  Cardoso,hard readings in old spanish she has been helpful when talked to her
7348,Dinora  Cardoso,the readings are difficult but we were allowed to discuss and work things out our class seem to work together well i think if you read you enjoy the discussions
7349,Dinora  Cardoso,far and away the worst teacher i have ever had
7350,Dinora  Cardoso,yes she is a tough teacher and she does intimidate you but if you really want to learn spanish and literature this is the class to take its a lot of reading she is very knowledgeable you might hate it but i think the pain was worth it you will only get how much as you put into the class
7351,Dinora  Cardoso,she is horrible worst spanish teacher ever i am a native speaker and she made me hate taking spanish she has favorites too which is stupid and because i spoke spanish well she automatically assumed we would be buddies i think so just put this weird lady in her place and you will have no problems just take phil
7352,Dinora  Cardoso,she was somewhat of a nice person but she was not quite helpful in the classroom she does show favoritism especially to those in her classes from the summer programs
7353,Dinora  Cardoso,i loved this class
7354,Dinora  Cardoso,i liked the class and the readings
7355,Dinora  Cardoso,horrible poor lecture skills poor interpersonal skills finds favorites which i was one of and takes care of those select few everyone else is left on their own and is frequently harrassed in class never enroll for her courses unless you enjoy pain
7356,Dinora  Cardoso,she is extremely nice she just needs to work on a louder speaking voice when she gives her prayers
7357,Dinora  Cardoso,no comments
7358,Dinora  Cardoso,she is the biggest trick ever ever ever ever take her class
7359,Frank  Tsui,really hard class you need to come prepared for each class to succeed make sure to pay attention during the lectures otherwise be lost read the textbook
7360,Frank  Tsui,worst class i have ever taken at unc this is a pre req for med schools and dental schools and most people in there are taking this class for that reason this class is extremely tough and they do not try to help or explain things well at all if you can take it somewhere else do it i made the mistake of taking it here and now have to repeat it
7361,Frank  Tsui,he is a nice person and i have found him to be more helpful in oneonone situations the lectures are not particularly helpful since you are expected to do the bulk of your learning in studio
7362,Frank  Tsui,terrible lecturer disorganized the physics department is terrible and he is apart of this mess never know what doing and their terrible explanations help at all good luck also they have no official textbook so good luck finding what you need to know
7363,Frank  Tsui,professor tsui was so convoluted in his explanations for problems it left me even more confused he goes above and beyond in his lectures so be prepared his exams are the hardest i have ever taken here even after taking orgo and biochemistry be prepared
7364,Frank  Tsui,reading the textbook is a must a nice guy but not the greatest teacher tests can be hard but he curves pretty generously write down all the examples and demonstrations in your notes they often appear on tests
7365,Frank  Tsui,i found this class to be very difficult the tests were extremely hard and i struggled most of the time frank is a cool guy and knows his stuff class was entertaining sometimes and deathly boring the other times the ta was absolutely worthless i dont think she engaged anyone in the class at any point
7366,Frank  Tsui,the lectures are fairly boring to someone who interested in physics attendance is required because of the iclickers as a part of your grade tests are challenging but he curves generously hw is assigned often and there are online quizzes english is not his strength but fine the class is not overly difficult and is manageable
7367,Frank  Tsui,demonstrations in class work of the time his english is his second language so sometimes hard to understand him his tests are all short answer sure about the final though many opportunities for grades participation homework home experiments pretests and exams however a lot of work
7368,Frank  Tsui,very easy to understand he had some great inclass demonstrations too the only things that bugged me were the clickers for attendance make sure you get a friend to pick your up for class if going to skip
7369,Frank  Tsui,a lot harder than i thought it would be
7370,Frank  Tsui,great teacher if you are interested in physics he is fun and makes sure to include the class in his teaching style might make it hard for a student who is not interested in physics taking ap physics makes this extremely easy
7371,Frank  Tsui,does not explain his lectures very well in class instead preferring to discuss concepts over doing actual example problems reading the textbook will be a must as you will probably not learn the material any other way his tests are also poorly worded and described would be better if he could actually explain his lecture material
7372,Frank  Tsui,very hard professor but explains stuff really hw useless
7373,Priscilla  Underwood,spent hours studying not clear on homework assignments essays graded harshly should of dropped the class
7374,Priscilla  Underwood,unreasonable professor too meticulous if looking to take a class where graded according to your performance this the class for you she has a set grading criteria on paper but fails to follow it herself at times i highly recommend not taking her class
7375,Priscilla  Underwood,shes honestly the worst teacher ive ever had she grades poorly shes rude if you dont do something its basically the end of the world for her im currently in the class and shes nothing but rude and disrespectful to each student just sat outside the classroom with a few students and we all agreed shes the worst teacher here
7376,Priscilla  Underwood,unclear on assignments unprofessional and rude grading criteria on papers is extremely subjective she has no problem handing it extremely low grades for fully completed assignments taking again because of her
7377,Priscilla  Underwood,pretty rude and a unreasonable prof stay when she says to study do the homework and you should be fine her grading criteria is not to bad though gives what you give to her still would not recommend her though
7378,Priscilla  Underwood,she was very rude and i would not recommend her i had to switch out of her class
7379,Priscilla  Underwood,horrible horrible professor she hardly every smiles and when she does very rare because of the time she is yelling at her students like children be prepared to feel like an idiot if you have the answer she is looking for she is by far the rudest lady on the planet i can honestly say i hate her
7380,Priscilla  Underwood,stay away from her she give us alot of homework i was spend the weekends doing the online homework it takes me more than hours so be careful
7381,Priscilla  Underwood,rude and treat the students like if they were in high school if you talk while talking she makes you stand up until done hate this teacher with passion she has a different personality every day take this teacher an old she care if trying everything needs to be perfect recommend her
7382,Priscilla  Underwood,i hate her
7383,Priscilla  Underwood,she is awesome
7384,Priscilla  Underwood,no personality go to class do your work keep quiet and you will be fine when she says study study a lot of people like her but those were the people that she was mean to because they did not do their work
7385,Priscilla  Underwood,she knows exactly what she wants it was an easy class take notes on how to write do your homework ad she usually gives extra points
7386,Priscilla  Underwood,she was the worst teacher ever had she would have a different personality every day and she rarely or should i say hardly ever passes anyone so if you take her good luck and have fun
7387,Priscilla  Underwood,great teach
7388,Priscilla  Underwood,no comments
7389,Priscilla  Underwood,
7390,Priscilla  Underwood,jekyll and hyde one moment she is smiling and the next she is anal but is fair do your work and keep quiet and be fine
7391,Priscilla  Underwood,she has a split personality friends say shes mean at all her students i think differently she is nice to a lot of them good teacher if u want strict and to learn a lot
7392,Priscilla  Underwood,great professor she help me a lot my other english classes were a thank you
7393,Michele  Serra,no comments
7394,Michele  Serra,ms serra is not the easiest teacher i have ever had but she is obviously motivated to help every student pass the class and learn to be a more confident speaker the other raters said she is very forgiving with absences but i do know people who were dropped for being absent too much after all a speech class and you have to be there
7395,Michele  Serra,ms serra is awesome she wants you to be able to communicate well and to pass her class sometimes her lectures lack clarity but she makes up for that with plain silliness easy a if you just show up to clase though she is very forgiving if you miss just give her a good reason why
7396,Michele  Serra,took another prof before and dropped because was too critical and was horrified of public speaking ms serra makes you feel very comfortable she has a very unique style which makes class fun her number one goal is to make sure you pass highly recommend
7397,Michele  Serra,great teacher.out going person you will never be bord in her class
7398,Michele  Serra,ms serra is a very odd instructor but in a good way she is very silly and fun and she helps you in any way possible to succeed in the class she will do anything it takes to get you to come to class she even thows pizza parties this class is very enjoyable and an easy a
7399,Michele  Serra,ms serra is an awesome teacher very unusual but extremely fun and helpful a must have class
7400,Michele  Serra,ms way of teaching breaks down a lot of barriers within the first class meeting after that it becomes easy to speak in front of the rest of the class
7401,Michele  Serra,as an older student returning to college she was so supporting and respectful since english is not my first language i had anxiety to take any oral communication class but in her class she valued my background effort and my accent.she tought me how to be an effective speaker in the society
7402,Michele  Serra,she creates an atmosphere of awareness and motivation
7403,Michele  Serra,i dropped this class two times before because i was so scared to take speech ms serra made it clear that students and relationships are more important than books and papers we still gave speeches and wrote papers but i learned how to mean what i say say what i mean ms serra rocks
7404,Michele  Serra,ms serra teaches the very opposite of other teachers which helps a lot when learning because you actually want to get involved and participate to get that a thanks for everything
7405,Michele  Serra,no comments
7406,Michele  Serra,hi katz n kittens mz serra is the best teacher period if other professors followed her exemplary way of teaching more students would love learning but alas mz serra is a cow no really she is a cow and oh so totally hot at the same time mz serra however is not an easy a she is a fun a
7407,Michele  Serra,ms serra is wonderful brilliant and hot but such a cow never met anyone who can be a cow and a beautiful person at the same time but she does and good at it thank you ms serra i enjoyed your class
7408,Michele  Serra,great class she helped me overcome my fear of public speaking and soo hot
7409,Michele  Serra,best speech teacher there could probably be if you are dreading the course in any way really helpful and she honestly cares about everyone the class should be simple for anyone comfortable with public speaking and be helpful to those who are not
7410,Michele  Serra,mz serra is great she cares about all her students and makes giving speeches fun no longer nervous to give speeches because i know that she cares about me and only wants me to do well show up to your speeches and get an a
7411,Michele  Serra,just great wants everyone to succeed very helpful energetic and fun helps everyone to become comfortable with standing in front of a room of people and speaking before enrolling i dreaded this class but from the first day i got a sense
7412,Bob  Baugher,face inadequate tests that will give you a lot of stress no canvas so be guessing what is your grade until the end of the quarter i will never recommend his classes to my friends
7413,Bob  Baugher,bob baugher is an amazing teacher he goes through and explains his lecture i really enjoy taking his class its definitely a good class to take if someone close to you has died
7414,Bob  Baugher,by far the best professor in my four years here at highline
7415,Bob  Baugher,dr bob is one of the best professors out there his lectures are very interesting and you can always relate to them he always tells stories that are fun to listen to as long as you are doing your studying do great on quizzes and exams
7416,Bob  Baugher,my favorite professor at highline he cares more about the students actually getting and understanding the information he gives feedback on all returned papers and he always has them graded within two days really cares about his students
7417,Bob  Baugher,he is soo cool but this class is not easy on exams definitely a good professor with passion but be ready for the reading
7418,Bob  Baugher,i took dr class because all of his amazing reviews and he is now easily my favorite professor ever had he is so knowledgable and this was one of those classes you will never forget he has the best stories and his lectures are amazing tests are a little long few short answer questions but as long as you take notes be fine
7419,Bob  Baugher,i enjoyed dr bob a lot since he made his lectures engaging he also sets up the classroom for you to interact peers if you need to take this course for credit i definitely recommend him take good be all the material you need on exams use notecards go thru the book and remember key definitions he gives bonus
7420,Bob  Baugher,best class taken at highline i got to know everybody he made us memorize name to do class discussions gives many extra cred so be sure to do them all might seem like matter but trust me it adds up returns tests next day he believes you should get feedback asap read book study take dr bob no regrets
7421,Bob  Baugher,one of the best professors i had at highline so good at what he does one of those classes you will remember for a lifetime
7422,Bob  Baugher,such a great professor definitely one of the rare gems at highline if taking psychology make sure to take it with dr bob very inspirational loved this class
7423,Bob  Baugher,great professor cares about his students as long as you do your work and extra credit pass
7424,Bob  Baugher,dr bob is the best proffessor i have ever met you have to take his class to believe he touched my heart he does everything possible for you to pass the class he has extra credit and he is flexible you will love his class
7425,Bob  Baugher,he is really nice professor that i have ever seen he helps me a lot i wanna take his class again
7426,Bob  Baugher,dr bob is an amazing instructor his lectures are beyond amazing and so enjoyable i took both is psych classes my first year at highline and i absolutely do not regret anything very organized too make sure to do those readings and study those before an exam there are no secrets just read memorize and study do the pt bonuses
7427,Bob  Baugher,one of those professors that remember for the rest of your life his lectures are engaging funny and packed with information that sticks with you he assigns a lot of reading and memorization because he wants the students to realize how much capable of every member of my class got to be friends with eachother
7428,Bob  Baugher,never dropped a class never not had a i walk into his class first few days are good a lot of handouts given but i loved his lectures he made the topic fun and enjoyable to learn but you have to study your butt off tests are really hard many of them they are long if you want a challenge have him as a teacher recommend
7429,Bob  Baugher,dr bob is the best teacher i have ever had he is respectable friendly funny and brilliant on the first day he gives you all of the essential information needed to pass the class it can feel overwhelming at first but incredibly helpful he fulfills his promise of teaching you all there is to know about human relations highly recommend
7430,Bob  Baugher,dr bob is such a great teacher yes his lectures are long and his reading assignments are very very very very long but in the end it is all so worth it make sure you know how to take good and efficient notes be that one student who looks lost during lectures i would take his class over and over again if i could just do it
7431,Bob  Baugher,more of a stand and talk kind of guy his handwriting can get a bit messy to read however his lectures are pretty amazing dr classes are definitely great to take although he does make a huge deal about independent reading and answering questions he incorporates his lectures with the reading show up read take notes and pass
7432,Carla  Steinberg,she is a pretty good teacher but the harder you work on an essay the lower your score i halfassed my last two essays and got while working hard on my first one and got a b she an easy grader for the most part and this is her last semester
7433,Carla  Steinberg,this class is very boaring lots of reading four essays plus a group project seems like she looked down on our generation not very helpfull we have to read the stories and peer edit our own papers so just sits their or talkes about who knows what
7434,Carla  Steinberg,carla is a straight up g she loves the material and loves seeing students dive in and excel with that being said a babe and a half
7435,Carla  Steinberg,lovess it
7436,Carla  Steinberg,requires a lot of reading nice old lady who respects others comments i highly recommend if you enjoy reading but has limited office hours she will do her best in class to help you with your essays kinda crazy lady though
7437,Carla  Steinberg,she is easy but grades harder than you think she is old and rather slow but makes the class fun i enjoyed her class but expected a better grade than what i got
7438,Carla  Steinberg,she is very enthusiastic and has a love for teaching that reminds us of why college offers just a lot more than grade school she reinforces the importance of using the words i and feel which help reestablish the individuality of a writer she was a thrill to have and her advice as well as wisdom serve as an added bonus on her resume
7439,Carla  Steinberg,great professor fun funny and loves the subject always interesting and very helpful never a dull moment and i took the class in the morning
7440,Carla  Steinberg,carla is a crazy little lady she definitely keeps the class entertained no tests and no final only three essays and all relatively easy if ur looking for a fun and easy english class u definitely want carla to be ur teacher
7441,Carla  Steinberg,she is the nicest woman ever low homework she is very understanding i got a kidney infection in the middle of semester and was out for weeks i tried to come back and she said you dont look so well go home and rest nicest woman ever no tests midterms and finals soo nice just engage in dicsussion you will make her day
7442,Carla  Steinberg,by far my favorite teacher she is extremely intelligent and intellectual this class is the only class i actually looked forward to going to her class has a lot of depth to it and she makes it very easy to achieve a high grade great woman
7443,Carla  Steinberg,no comments
7444,Carla  Steinberg,great professor very helpful pretty easy class definitley would recommend in shes very helpful outside of class very opinionate but in a good way
7445,Carla  Steinberg,i love carla she emphasizes discussion in class if you have something to say she listens compassionate grader and excellent professor who obviously enjoys teaching take her class if you can
7446,Carla  Steinberg,this teacher will talk your ear off during every class some of it relevant to the subject she is pretty opinionated although she claims otherwise so choose your words carefully overall a great teacher and your assignments hard it was an enjoyable class
7447,Carla  Steinberg,she is a great professor she had my back when the campus dean tried to expel me she is there for the well being of all students in the classroom and out
7448,Carla  Steinberg,no comments
7449,Carla  Steinberg,i loved her class she is very interesting she cares more about your ideas than the topic of english she is simply amazing
7450,Carla  Steinberg,very sweet lady fun class
7451,Carla  Steinberg,sweet elderly lady that is willing to go out of her way to help her students and is always open to suggestions allows for rewrites and attendance is not required be alarmed when she hits her head on the wall
7452,Wendy  Ho,professor lectures are convoluted and structure she gives nearly no opportunities for student involvement that said she is truly passionate about her work and her students and it shows in the lengthy and helpful feedback she gives on the four essays she assigns the readings are amazing just too bad we get to discuss them
7453,Wendy  Ho,wendy ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students she is accessible approachable hilarious passionate and truly a one of a kind professor she takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging yes her assigned readings and essays are challenging but she teaches so much and is a great resource i loved this class
7454,Wendy  Ho,omg worst prof ever had she literally talks in riddles and there is so much reading and theyre difficult she pins you into going to lecture cause participation is and other papers plus final i literally can never follow her at all avoid pretty much my entire class dreaded her and the material
7455,Wendy  Ho,oh my god this has probably been my worst experience ever as a student she rambled on and on n on during lectures about topics just barely related to the material i tried to take notes but honestly there was no point there are wayy too many readings to stay caught up on and quite lengthy tests are on all readings not worth it avoid
7456,Wendy  Ho,you have a lot of readings every week the midterms final and papers are based on these readings she repeats what is important in lecture so you miss it participation in discussion is a must for points go to the ta for help on the papers it makes a huge difference i went from a paper to after meeting the ta
7457,Wendy  Ho,she is passionate but style of instruction and evaluation is not reasonable no ppt substantial readings mcq can be ridiculously tricky and the ambiguous wording remind me of sat in discussion you have to talk to get the points the evaluation of paper totally depends on your ta which could be subjective remember you have other ge options
7458,Wendy  Ho,personally i enjoy this class while tas were very helpful and kind professor ho tended to go on angry rants during lecture very passionate but she would digress from the readings and run out of time educating us on the history tests were relatively easy if you did the readings or pages readings per week that is
7459,Wendy  Ho,asa is the best class taken so far prof ho is very passionate in her teaching and i suggest you participate ask questions answer questions sit near the front to be engaged in the course as she can go on tangents this course will fulfill a lot of ge but you got to work for it a lot of reading and papers discussion worth a lot
7460,Wendy  Ho,prof ho is one of the worst lecturers ever had in my three years at uc davis do not take her class asa with her was extraordinarily difficult and been taking upper division classes in ethnic studies for two years she cannot explain things simply she always has to take the long way around answering a straightforward question
7461,Wendy  Ho,just do all of the required readings and attend lecture she is essentially the study guide for the exams pay attention she also gives actual study guides that help refresh your memory if you review you have much trouble for the multiplechoice exams participation matters during the discussion period there are also two page essays
7462,Wendy  Ho,super inspirational loved this class though she tends to ramble on about the same things for the first half hour of every class midterm and final are both multiple choice questions and are easy if you do the reading do the reading a lot though the way the questions are structured too hard to guess page papers
7463,Wendy  Ho,tough class with a lot of material although much of it is dry you will learn a lot probably more than you should in a single week class tests are straightforward and follow the reading she is a ton
7464,Wendy  Ho,great teacher to take talks about the importance of effort and learning with passion love to take another class with her
7465,Wendy  Ho,she is amazing to listen to my favorite class ever very discussion based no tests three short papers possibly creative project substitute a group project and two short write ups of your choice do your best to read and talk with her if things come up she can be flexible with assignments not out to fail you but you have to try hard
7466,Wendy  Ho,lectures are confusing and boring i gave up on going at all a loot of readings too however tests are multiple choice and super easy if you keep up with the readings and do her handouts there are papers overall an ok class pretty easy to get a b if you put a little bit more effort in you can definitely get an a
7467,Wendy  Ho,so hard to follow her lectures every time i actually went to class i ended up not being able to take any notes because she speaks so unclearly tests are pretty easy though
7468,Wendy  Ho,such a wonderful lady the textbook she used was very relevant and great for the class she was very relatable and understanding
7469,Wendy  Ho,tons of readings and she often goes off on random rants about life this quarter her favorite lines are be spongebobs or walking dead sometimes going to lecture is totally useless but then there are other times when she is focused and actually the readings
7470,Wendy  Ho,oh no forget this lady she made my life hell never take any class with her a warning her lectures are boring as hell she only gives her opinion and give actual facts her exams are stupid pointless i honestly know how she became a professor just take her especially all the reading she makes you do is a bit crazy
7471,Wendy  Ho,her lectures are absolutely pointless the only real reason ito go is for the handouts she would give she claims cares for critical thinking yet the midterm and final are multiple choice the amount or reading is absolutely ridiculous the amount of reading is absolutely ridiculous trust me and please save your self take this class
7472,Andy  Jones,dr andy is super passionate about his classes and ucd not for everyone but i personally enjoyed his class his essay prompts and grading criteria ambiguous or unreasonable participation and attendance count he makes that clear from day one if content to not show or show up with a disengaged attitude find a different class
7473,Andy  Jones,half of class was spent with him humble bragging about how marvelous himself and his achievements are and the other half was spent with him explaining his unclear prompts in the most obscure way possible a tough grader with high expectations so to office hours and get feedback on drafts before turning in your final paper and you should do ok
7474,Andy  Jones,i feel like dr andy is a love him or hate him kind of professor because he talks about things he likes poetry film music and gives lots of factoids in class it could mean amazing or bust depending on what type of student you are i personally liked him because i learned a lot during class and office hours he nurtures creativity a family man
7475,Andy  Jones,he makes a great deal about being in class in order to pass yet all he talks about in class is his poetry or his books or his columns on newspapers he spends of the class time bragging about the same things on a daily basis how he got selected how he was awarded the bragging never ends it amuses me how he manages to sneak it in everyday
7476,Andy  Jones,nice guy joined his freshman seminar on accident poems a week and if you go to his favorite poetry club buy you sweet potato fries
7477,Andy  Jones,why does dr andy not have a chili pepper the beard
7478,Andy  Jones,dr andy makes this class very interesting i would take it for sure my favorite professor that i have had at davis
7479,Andy  Jones,dr andy jones is a great professor he always had extra office hours in downtown davis he is really helpful although he is a tough grader its only because he wants you to be a better write you will learn a lot the readings were light not too much also really funny he always made the class laugh a class i never wanted to miss
7480,Andy  Jones,tries to engage the class and have them participate which is nice really seems to have enthusiasm and want students to learn and better themselves as writers can be really intimidating at times and overpowering though also grades rather harshly so be fooled into thinking this class is easy hard work perfect attendance average grade
7481,Andy  Jones,i loved this class the class topics provoked a lot of thought and discussion i learned a lot about my writing and how i can combine writing with my photography and other multimedia work i do in my other tcs classes dr andy assigned interesting readings some of the writing assignments were hard definitely a lot of work definitely worth it
7482,Andy  Jones,dr andy is the best the class was very eye opening and dr andy allowed us a lot of flexibility as far as creativity is concerned the reader is amazing i will pass it onto my kids the assignments may seem unclear at points but really you realize dr andy just wants you to materialize the assignment into anything you like best teacher
7483,Andy  Jones,good teacher but he requires a lot of busy work and assignments are unclear at times
7484,Andy  Jones,great teacher professor andy jones made the sixweek quarter fly by i liked his powerpoint quizzes and his crazy allusions the class is a lot of work but he grades fair i really appreciated wideeyed humor he connects almost everything we read to other assigned works or to pop culture i would take another class with him in a minute
7485,Andy  Jones,i learned a lot from dr andy about how to think and how to write a funny guy who makes a reaally long class three hours in the summer fly by he makes you get to know your classmates which is also cool the group assignment was tough mostly because of scheduling challenges but i learned the most from that paper and from office hours
7486,Andy  Jones,dr class really inspired me to learn and to think creatively about my writing and he also brings a ton of energy to class discussions i can see why asucd gave him the professor of the year award congrats andy
7487,Andy  Jones,awesome guy
7488,Andy  Jones,very enthusiastic teacher very fun and exciting class had some very unique and original projects for the class
7489,Andy  Jones,one freaking awesome english teacher is designed to allow you to use and experiment with different kinds of media and andy asks you to do all of these butt crazy things that you really understand why doing it but at least it was fun and unpredictable workload is kinda heavy but if you keep up with it do well
7490,Andy  Jones,andy jones is an extremely nice kind teacher always willing to help you out however this class tcs191 needed a lot of work what are we learning what is going on what is the purpose i have never been so lost yet not in a class before what
7491,Andy  Jones,great teacher very enthusiastic about class can be unclear about assignment
7492,Tom  Kemetzo,started with lif ended with death the class
7493,Tom  Kemetzo,he was a little unusually but really engaging class was always interesting and he held my attention i also learned a great deal and even sort of look at life a little differently now it is a shame he no longer teaches
7494,Tom  Kemetzo,i was hoping that mr kmetzo was still teaching at nvcc as he was one of the most inspiring teachers that ever had and i wanted to comment kmetzo still stands out in my memory as one of the best teachers even though i took his classes in funny and interesting person highly recommended
7495,Tom  Kemetzo,tom is the greatest of all time the number teacher ever had a bit out of the norm but ask him what the norm is and tell you all about the chairness truthfully the most inspiring man of my life dean where are you
7496,Carl  Jorgensen,took his freshman seminar class and found it quite interesting this was a pass fail class so it hard but he was helpful he did talk a lot about his life but it was interesting to me
7497,Carl  Jorgensen,worst prof ever very unorganized very boring and talks too much about his damn life talks about other bs that dsnt have to do class loses papers and tells us at fault what a butthole papers only paper can be redone since ppl always get a low grade if retired as he is come back to teach
7498,Carl  Jorgensen,there are no words to describe the torture his class inflicted on me he is disorganized unclear boring and shares too much personal information the were not that bad but his lectures were horrible avoid him
7499,Carl  Jorgensen,i regret enrolling in this course
7500,Carl  Jorgensen,ok so this class is by far the worst class in sociology i have taken as a matter of fact the worst ever lectures are so boring and his teaching is so unorganized the reader and his handouts were complicated to find nothing was in order and it was simply just not enjoyable i hope he hasnt been teaching it this way all this time finally over
7501,Carl  Jorgensen,very confusing i regret enrolling in this class his soc class is way more tolerable than soc
7502,Carl  Jorgensen,it is hard to understand what the class subject is really about his lec are very boring most of the time he has a lot of info that he wants to share but often are just stories tha tdont relate no tests commentaries and short quizes attendance counts and will help your grade
7503,Carl  Jorgensen,despite what others may is the the coolest and smartest prof in soc.his has been in davis for class normal he is constantly challenging ideas and making you think.what people handle is that he really cares about his material and about his students but he presents it differently

7506,Carl  Jorgensen,worst.professor ever he was so boring he listen to students and if anyone talked in class he put them down if you went to his office hours always late and he respect your point of view he will argue with you and make you think wrong
7507,Carl  Jorgensen,boring lectures off topic all the time inconsistent grading cancelled office hours and appointments with students not a good class at all worst professor in the soc department
7508,Carl  Jorgensen,jorgensen interesting character the class is very unique and very unlike any other class on campus interactivity is upon your interest if you raise critical questions discussions can make you ponder even after the class we went out to a movie and dinner as a class if you are on waitlist count on it
7509,Carl  Jorgensen,if you can handle a boring take one of the easiest soc classes the way to get an a is all in showing up and participating the essays are a bunch one one pagers super easy and partly graded by who quickly become your friends if you want a easy class on a rocken topic who cares if he rambels your ta will clarify everything
7510,Carl  Jorgensen,i still have no idea what the class is about he goes off topic a lot and not clear on assignments really boring too worst professor in the soc department
7511,Carl  Jorgensen,the hardest part about this class was sitting through the lectures just do the reading and the take home papers will be cake make lots of references to your reader and the handouts he gives you in class definitely skip as many lectures as your conscience will allow so much potential wasted
7512,Carl  Jorgensen,jorgensen is the best professor in the department bar none lectures handouts and video documentaries are all quite educational jorgensen is truly an inspiration
7513,Carl  Jorgensen,easy class for a seminar not that much reading also jorgensen is so funny
7514,Carl  Jorgensen,the man is insultive and unable to conceed any point he is an awful lecturer and his theories are ridiculous what a waste of money
7515,Carl  Jorgensen,complete jerk i do not suggest taking this class by any means he is unclear boring and incredibly pompous he thinks that just because he is old and graduated from harvard he is intelligent he is not
7516,Mary  Donaghy,the exams are not cupcakes yet dr donaghy gives many opportunities and resources to preform adequately she is lecture heavy and fails to project her quiet voice very well but i love her class sit near the front take decent notes and read through the chapter vocab and make an a or b
7517,Mary  Donaghy,i took her minority and stratification she is a very sweet lady it is hard to understand her because she talk so low you must read your chapters to pass her test it is not an easy a if what you looking for overall i enjoyed her class especially minority groups
7518,Mary  Donaghy,if taken her before for a level class and are expecting her social theory class to be just as easy think again the tests are killer reading is not optional if you want to pass the tests are not multiple choice matching and short answer
7519,Mary  Donaghy,taking her for minority groups if you read over the material at least some before the test make an a or b discussion boards are basically completion grades be prepared to stay the full class timeshe has a lot to say
7520,Mary  Donaghy,only thing good about this class is the bonus points but the questions are so hard the bonus points are worthless also in this class there are graduate students which set the curve way to high and everyone else struggles
7521,Mary  Donaghy,love this professor her voice is soft and monotone but she is wonderful
7522,Mary  Donaghy,overall great teacher however she has a very low voice so it is hard to hear her if you read the chapters and show up to the bonus videos you will get a good grade attendance is also not required after the third week of school
7523,Mary  Donaghy,dr donaghy is a great professor if you actually read the book and listen to the lecture it is an easy a
7524,Mary  Donaghy,she is sweet but so hard to pay attention to tests are difficult even with a study guide i studied hard for every one but never made an a.she passes around a sign in sheet every day lots of opportunities for bonus points it could be better but it could be worse
7525,Mary  Donaghy,very sweet class is terribly boring but she does pass around a sign in sheet almost every day tests hard but they easy and you do get a study guide she is very smart and passionate about her subject
7526,Mary  Donaghy,shes very knowledgeable about her chosen subjects attendance isnt necessary tests are easy the classes are dry and boring but incredibly informative she talks you listen get a good grade easy as that
7527,Mary  Donaghy,nice boring informative go to class do your homework you will be fine
7528,Mary  Donaghy,if everyone approached life as she does we would have a better world and minority group should be a mandatory class for every major maybe then we would learn tolerance for others and thier cultures and not be so closed minded we are in college where we should all have open minds to new things how else can you grow as a person
7529,Mary  Donaghy,very smart and nice
7530,Mary  Donaghy,easy professor will be boring though does not take role after first week goes over every question in lecture or you can just read the book and skip is very nice and super helpful with any questions one of best professors
7531,Mary  Donaghy,this is for minority groups she is very boring but a nice lady she does drop the lowest test grade you have to go to class much she posts everything on blackboard easy class with alot of extra bonus assignments dr donaghy is very nice and will help you if you need it
7532,Mary  Donaghy,but a good teacher is willing to work with you during hard times attendance is not a deal with her at all and little speackers that asu has she gives you extra points for going
7533,Mary  Donaghy,gender class did not make the course very interesting at all does not take attendance tests are extremely easy nice teacher even though a little hard to hear and listen to after a while grades exams quickly and posts blackboard promptly no surprises essays pop quizzes or tests do contain a few required questions
7534,Mary  Donaghy,social theory is not an easy course the tests are hard she is difficult to pay attention to read the book and do the group presentation you really do have to read the book she says so and serious
7535,Mary  Donaghy,very easy all you have to do is get the notes off of black bored and study that you dont really even have to go to class all you have to do is look on blackbored everything is on there
7536,Carroll  Hale,absolutely the most caring and knowledgeable professor i have ever had boy does he know how to teach
7537,Carroll  Hale,devastatingly handsome but mostly a great professor who cares a lot about his students make sure to speak up during critique
7538,Carroll  Hale,hale is a wonderful professor grading is fair he might come off as mean but he is not at all he makes class enjoyable with his stories
7539,Carroll  Hale,i took sculpture and design with this man and if i was not an art ed major be a scultpure major i learned so much and had a great time hale is like obi wan
7540,Carroll  Hale,excellent professor
7541,Carroll  Hale,mr hale is awesome he loves to interact with his students and loves to have fun watch out for the first day or two you are in there with him because he comes off as a bit mean not mean at all just let him get warmed up to the class first take him you will not regret it
7542,Carroll  Hale,mr hale is a great teacher with a good sense of humor he may come off a little rough at first but great he expects you to put in the effort and will grade accordingly put in the effort and you will do good i would definitely take him again in fact i am
7543,Carroll  Hale,carroll is a very effective professor a bit on the grouchy side but incredibly intelligent and skilled i have the highest degree of respect for his teaching ability and talent if you are cronically late miss class or put in enough time outside class you get any sympathy from him tough but fair
7544,Carroll  Hale,he expects you to try your best and work your hardest he will even come in outside of class just to help you if you need help he doesnt mind you calling him at home he is extremely caring and understanding if you have outside problems that effect your work he does come off as extremely intemidating but dont let that fool you he is wonderful
7545,Carroll  Hale,this class was so much fun mr hale comes off as an hole at first but he is such a wonderful teacher he is a very talented sculptor and knows how to pass his skills on other people the class is a challenge but only because after he gets a feel for the class he expects everything he knoes he can get and more from you
7546,Tyler  Spalding,fun
7547,Tyler  Spalding,he was a great teacher and made things very clear for both classes it sucks that he is gone his grading was very fair and helped out students alot
7548,Tyler  Spalding,tyler spalding is the best aerospace teacher you can get he is a purist so while you may have more work to do you understand the material to a greater extent and he grades quite liberally
7549,Tyler  Spalding,tyler was great he explained everything and gave plenty of bonus points just be careful on his tests they hard but they can be tricky
7550,Tyler  Spalding,he is the best professor taken in engineering statics was a cake walk just do you homework and write the homework problems on your sheet for the test and your halfway home girls think hot
7551,Tyler  Spalding,sure hes hot but also fast paced if you dont get it the first time youre screwed he doesnt understand that everyone isnt as brilliant as him
7552,Tyler  Spalding,all the girls want him
7553,Tyler  Spalding,no comments
7554,Tyler  Spalding,this is my time in this class and he explains things better than the other professor

7560,Alan  Bell,a nice man but old and stuck in his ways he talks soo slowly that you can barely pay attention and he reads from movie review essays he wrote years ago a nice man but makes film boring and a film student
7561,Alan  Bell,great elective if you want to learn how to properly deconstruct a film then your man not only does he know his stuff but he is an engaging and insightful lecturer and totally engaged with the subject matter highly recommended
7562,Alan  Bell,a good elective class not difficult and an interesting character i recommend this class to people who are wanting an intellectual thoughtprovoking class you watch movies and talk about them but it was decent and easy everyone has to give their opinion so be prepared to talk in class
7563,Alan  Bell,allen knows his stuff inside and out however well aware of this and as such values his own opinion that aside the class is a breeze and only consists of daily journals participation and an exam if you have ever watched a movie in your life you could probably do well in this class
7564,Alan  Bell,alan is a really nice guy i only took it because i needed a level elective and i could get it done in weeks so if you are looking for an elective take this class if you have any interest in movies at all ps never seen anyone break so much chalk in my life haha
7565,Alan  Bell,no comments
7566,Alan  Bell,just tell him what he wants to hear he is not interested in your opinion he teaches same films over and over china town reel some film on cinematography sweet hereafter and eyes wide shut he will toot his own horn a lot since he edited the script for sweet hereafter fair marker didnt get a lot out of his classes
7567,Alan  Bell,very kind and experienced interested in class discussion
7568,Alan  Bell,incredibly caring knowledgable fair unfairly labelled by students who listen his lectures are fascinating
7569,Alan  Bell,good for an elective get a lot from his classes and his lack of left me in the dark at times very odd at times just say what he wants you to hear i think too old to care too much anymore what others think
7570,Alan  Bell,allen bell is a very nice man with a command for his subject he is a brilliant writer and understands the film industry very well which reflects on his teachings he picks engaging movies and is fair with his marking
7571,Alan  Bell,well not lining the bottom of the barrel as some film profs however tempermental and terribly unclear about what he wants no effort is really required so recommend his class to types
7572,Alan  Bell,this was a good class and refreshing to be in a class with someone who is actually involved in the industry and has opinions got me interested in one of the more interesting classes i took in my degree i still actually think about it
7573,Alan  Bell,he still very bitter about atom egoyan
7574,Alan  Bell,how anyone could possibly not adore bell is beyond me he is smart open engaging charming and quirkynot to mention a phenomenal writer layout and marking is fair films are interesting and diverse thank you alan
7575,Alan  Bell,bell is smart and he can be witty but a very bad teacher his lectures are entertaining because such a nutball start yelling for no reasons about a stupid detail from a film unclear and vague avoid
7576,Alan  Bell,no comments
7577,Alan  Bell,i do not doubt that he is a talented writer but he seems to be at a loss for what is expected in an academic setting his course was really just film appreciation with no academic rigour instructions to the class could be vague and contradictory
7578,Jim  Mulrooney,a great professor he goes into detail and explains everything to the t take him again
7579,Jim  Mulrooney,good class will learn more here than in most classes but if you hate speaking in class it might not be for you but the class is defiantly not boring
7580,Jim  Mulrooney,i say enough about dr mulrooney i was doing poorly in his class due to some personal issues that kept me out of class i sat down with him in his office after class to talk about it and see what i could do and i have to say that hands down the most understanding professor had he let me retake the exam i missed incredible man
7581,Jim  Mulrooney,great professor the reason why i switched my major to bms i call him easy but he makes the class interesting so you will want to pay attention if you can definitely take him
7582,Jim  Mulrooney,he is such great teacher very strong science background very helpfull he is extremely clear in explain the material i had him for low level class but i wish to had for a higher one but he is the best he is the king of sciences
7583,Jim  Mulrooney,take him you regret it he really cares about his students he wants people to do well chair of the department for a reason
7584,Jim  Mulrooney,secret is going to his study sessions great teacher really funny holds attentions learned a lot
7585,Jim  Mulrooney,simply a wonderful professor made the class entertaining and fun by using pingpong balls it was a journal based class so as long as you read the papers and read them not just glanced do fine take any class you can with him
7586,Jim  Mulrooney,he will tell you on the test but you need to know the answers in painful detail underestimate this class because everyone told you easy
7587,Jim  Mulrooney,dr.mulrooney is one of the best teachers i can honestly say ever had he is funny and extremely knowledgable and helpful
7588,Jim  Mulrooney,funny guy which always helps in keeping the attention of the students especially in lecture fairly easy grader but tough subject overall if you do your job as a student go above and beyond his job as a teacher to ensure that you comprehend this tricky subject recommended
7589,Jim  Mulrooney,awesome professor take him if you can great
7590,Jim  Mulrooney,you will have him if you are a major and wish he taught every course the man really cares about the students
7591,Jim  Mulrooney,he is a great professor he really wants everyone to do well he keeps you informed about what he expects of you and is really laid back is truly a good professor and a good guy
7592,Jim  Mulrooney,really fun teacher takes things a lot more seriously than guess but only because he cares
7593,Jim  Mulrooney,awesome guy funny fun class never used the textbook and it was expensive exams
7594,Jim  Mulrooney,cool guy exams helpful wants everyone to do well unlike some other teachers tells the exam questions before hand
7595,Jim  Mulrooney,very nice easy going nice class is he married
7596,Jim  Mulrooney,best bms teacher tries to have fun with the class and still gets the material across great highly recommended i learned a lot from this class
7597,Jim  Mulrooney,good guy easy class gives you questions that are on the tests so if you fail just lazy learned alot too highly recommended
7598,Dave  Kowalka,wonderful professor who clearly cares about each and every one of his students whenever i needed help with anything he was there to help me he is sort of goofy but it makes the class more enjoyable and the time fly by i suggest that you take as many classes as possible with him he will help you through
7599,Dave  Kowalka,dr kowalka is a great professor you will learn a lot about teaching especially if you are planning on teaching social studies
7600,Dave  Kowalka,most of the time the assignments were unclear and everyone was confused assignments had due dates but you could turn in whatever you want whenever you wanted to did not seem to have to much structure he is a very nice and funny guy though
7601,Dave  Kowalka,super funny
7602,Dave  Kowalka,he will never know your name nor will he actually talk about the content he is supposed to be teaching we spent over a week presenting book reports to the class he even seem to be knowledgeable about the material he was teaching you waste so much time in this class take it with knickerbocker you will walk away a lot smarter
7603,Dave  Kowalka,great prof great class very meaningful experience i got a lot of useful info from that class and i still use a lot of it in the classroom
7604,Dave  Kowalka,he is a very nice guy i think i can live with him for the rest of the semester
7605,Dave  Kowalka,he was my iul prof freshman year and i think i could have asked for a better one he let our class out or weeks early and only made us write one one page paper which was nothing compared to some profs
7606,Dave  Kowalka,very good good class topics good first hand stories a little unclear on assignments which he plans to change great class great teacher
7607,Dave  Kowalka,i want to be just like kowalka he is a great guy and very understanding although you do much in his class the stories that he tells teach you everything you need to know and expect about teaching the best professor ever
7608,Dave  Kowalka,has many many stories good prof but hard to follow his directions and will change them next class
7609,Dave  Kowalka,great prof his assignments were easy yet meaningful a great beginning to my education degree he is easy to talk to understanding loves to give out candy and makes class enjoyable great job kowalka
7610,Dave  Kowalka,wow this guy is great first class with him love the class love the prof learning a ton without a lot of buys work best class ive ever had
7611,Dave  Kowalka,kowalka is a wonderful teacher and makes the class fun i really enjoyed his class

7616,Dave  Kowalka,no comments
7617,Dave  Kowalka,kowalka is an amazing professor great guy fun class
7618,Antonio  Rodriguez,he is one of the worst professors wait the worst professor that i have ever had he makes the class way too hard for people who have no clue about geology coming in he is somewhat clear in class but makes the tests very very hard do not take his class
7619,Antonio  Rodriguez,the man is not helpful in the least the class is boring and i had as much fun as i would have watching paint dry on the wall
7620,Antonio  Rodriguez,thies class is way too hard for a class there is a lot of information to learn and the tests are killer rodriguez is much harder than the other professors i would not suggest taking him unless you really enjoy geology

7624,Gerald  O\'Connell,he is a good teacher very interesting and his lectures are not boring he is quite funny
7625,Gerald  O\'Connell,mr really knows his expects a lot but he is worth it also like years old but looks mad hot
7626,Ramona  Girdauskas,she went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in accounting field i prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter but it was totally useless there were quite a lot of who already know everything and the professor taught them not us
7627,Ramona  Girdauskas,one of the best prof at seneca shes so nice and easy marker
7628,Ramona  Girdauskas,i feel that she really knows what she is talking about and therefore manages to explain the subjects very well she is helpful and makes sure that everybody understands the topic yet one does not feel stressed or pushed
7629,Ramona  Girdauskas,she is amazing professor her explanation is so clear and so easy for understanding so you can forget about math problems that you had before moreover she has warm heart and she is very kind professor
7630,Ramona  Girdauskas,a good professor just very boring you always seem to get sleepy and just want to sleep all throughout her classes
7631,Ramona  Girdauskas,listen to lectures do the homework read the book she gives good feedback and will clarify any questions asked
7632,Ramona  Girdauskas,overall pretty good prof her lectures can be pretty dull but you have to remember it is accounting pay attention to her lectures and do the homework she is a generous marker so on tests make sure you write whatever you can as she gives part marks she even hinted at this during a test
7633,Ramona  Girdauskas,for me she is introverted professor but she is very warm hearted so far i really like to go in her class because i study she explains well and the works are always done on time her teaching skill is professional she knows what students need to pass this course participate in class ask to clear sth u dont know and kill the quizes and exam
7634,Ramona  Girdauskas,one of the nicest teachers i have had she uses ppt in class and makes everything very clear class is a bit boring but come on it is accounting she is always willing to help and spend time with students have questions very patient if you could i would definitely suggest to take her class
7635,Ramona  Girdauskas,i like this professor she is clear in the class and willing to help students who do not understand acc220 itself is a hard course you need to pay attention if you show up every time and ask questions you will get an a
7636,Ramona  Girdauskas,amazing professor that she explain very well and spend whole class time that mean she want to waste any minute
7637,Ramona  Girdauskas,never take her class never
7638,Ramona  Girdauskas,her classes can kinda drag on but nice and very helpful if you understand something you do the homework the class is easy and honestly attendance will not be necessary she takes classes for each chapter which necessary tbh but i would take her again
7639,Ramona  Girdauskas,overall she is a good teacher who covers everything that are on the final exams a lot of the need to go to class is covered by the wileyplus test and practice although as always it is advised that you do go as she will lecture using good examples and explanations
7640,Ramona  Girdauskas,she is a nice professor she tries to explain everything for us even though its just same questions
7641,Ramona  Girdauskas,she is a very good teacher i recommend for my subject we used the financial calculator which makes everything easier very good on teaching you how to use the calculator
7642,Ramona  Girdauskas,she gets confused while teaching i wish i dropped the class
7643,Ramona  Girdauskas,she was by far one of my fav professors in first semester very helpful if you do the homework and pay attention in class you will get an a the best
7644,Ramona  Girdauskas,she is a really nice person and very responsible though her classes are a little boring she tries her best to explain the book as clear as she can actually a easy marker but i get the mark i expected know why
7645,Ramona  Girdauskas,she is the best if you want to learn math go with her she is like a tutor goes with the book she is responsible she make the test exactly from the book not the very difficult one but some times very easy one
7646,Kenneth  Hicks,this is the worst teacher ever i know his whole life story because all he does is talk about himself and his family if your sitting through his class you might as well shoot your self in the foot because that would be more fun then his lectures
7647,Kenneth  Hicks,i never ever had a prof like him.he is not a fair marker he will give marks who will listen his own
7648,Kenneth  Hicks,nobody understand and has interests what he saying in class always he talks all and leave i know why he is doing this job in seneca
7649,Kenneth  Hicks,please drop the class bcz i have no words
7650,Kenneth  Hicks,he is nice but only the problem is he does not teach and everybody is bored in class
7651,Kenneth  Hicks,this guy is the most boring teacher use blackboard there is a reason it used at seneca if you teach and damn your class is so boring then atleast put up powerpoints so we can learn on our own always talking about his life so hard to learn from this guy choose another teacher now before its too late
7652,Kenneth  Hicks,just reades from the power point and then talks about himself only told us about how successful he has been at every top job hold in his life about millions times
7653,Kenneth  Hicks,ever believe any of his stories there are all lies he is the laziest professor ever never taking his class again
7654,Kenneth  Hicks,the worst professor i never ever had
7655,Kenneth  Hicks,the worst professor i never ever had he will always talking about his own business you get a good results
7656,Kenneth  Hicks,good prof but i must say that he gets boring after telling u the same stories about his business family etc so ken stop wondering why people stop coming to your eight classes all that aside good guy choose him and have it very easy pro and final
7657,Kenneth  Hicks,he is a very good teacher and fair marker just do your cases home works you will not have more then two cases for all semester do not skip his classes he does not like it.also try to participate in class this subject is stupid but the teacher is ok
7658,Kenneth  Hicks,can not learn a lot from his class no efficient no quiz you never know your homework is right or not but pass might not difficult high grade is not easy
7659,Kenneth  Hicks,dont take this he shows is powerpoint very boring very unfair marker because only ppl he like get good mark
7660,Kenneth  Hicks,this guy cant teach all he does is read from powerpoint and talk bs about all these high position jobs he had making millions of in sales
7661,Kenneth  Hicks,little midterm and final
7662,Kenneth  Hicks,getting good results is impossible unless you attend all classes
7663,Kenneth  Hicks,i say he is a good prof because he gives dood results a or to his fevorite students only
7664,Kenneth  Hicks,good teacher but i say he is a good marker
7665,Kenneth  Hicks,good teacher you can easily pass your course with good grade
7666,Cindy  Herbert,i learned a lot just from talking with her very inspirational she is one of my fave teachers and i recommend her for computer classes she was super caring and would answer any questions you had i passed this class with an a just do the work and you will pass no doubt i loved her though super sweet
7667,Cindy  Herbert,mrs herbert is amazing if you show up to class pay attention and do the work you will at least pass if not get a great grade enjoyable and relational fantastic teacher
7668,Cindy  Herbert,i really enjoyed this class i took the online version as long as you do the work and really try you can get an a there is a lot of homework but it is pretty easy you just have to follow the book one word of advise buy the book from the school you need a code for this class and if you buy outside the school you still have to pay for it
7669,Cindy  Herbert,she teaches straight from the book but she will go over it in class before you attempt it just in case the book was not clear enough the actual class and material were easy and she simplified it even more great teacher
7670,Cindy  Herbert,professor herbert is by far my favorite professor i have ever had online or in a classroom she was extremely helpful and truly cared that her students understood the materials she also made it to where success was easy if you put in the work i appreciated her teaching style very much and would definitely recommend her as a professor
7671,Cindy  Herbert,easiest class i had last spring semester mrs herbert is a very inspiring and amazing instructor she helped me so much and inspired me to keep following my dreams as long as you listen show up for class every time do the work and ask questions than an easy a i received an in this class i would take her again in a heartbeat
7672,Cindy  Herbert,she was a good instructor but really she instruct anything everything was based off of your textbook and a lab website i had some issues arrive and she willing to work with me outside of one instance the only reason i take another one of her classes is because its not really my thing i take much away from it
7673,Cindy  Herbert,the class is about she goes through all if you know much about functions and querying in these program you will do just fine she teaches you the basics and then goes very in depth so pay attention everything comes from the book so hesitate to get ahead of the game grading is amazing hundreds of points likeable
7674,Cindy  Herbert,i took this class for an week semester pretty good with microsoft office in general so this class was pretty easy plus herbert is very nice and everything is very clear i even emailed her and asked if she would open a couple tests up early so i have to take it finals week and she totally understood and opened them up
7675,Cindy  Herbert,cindy she is okay i guess she expects a lot of work for a bs computer class you have at least to assignments due each week and then when you do them and you follow the directions as best as you can she takes off points without explaining why so you can better yourself i mean do the assignments and be fine
7676,Cindy  Herbert,this class is really easy you do an in class assignment and then you do the exact same thing in an application i reccomend this class to everyone i missed literally points in the whole entire class and the class has like points plus you learn some great things about excel word powerpoint and access that will help you in live
7677,Cindy  Herbert,if you ask her for help very helpful
7678,Cindy  Herbert,this is a great teacher thorough helpful very punctual she always got back to me to help even on the due dates which were on sundays she made videos about my work personally to help me really understand love her and wish i could take the nest class with her do the work and you will get good grades book absolutely necessary
7679,Cindy  Herbert,cindy herbert is a wonderful instructor very concise and clear about the curriculum if you show up and stay the entire class you rewarded with attendance fair warning i would definitely take her again
7680,Cindy  Herbert,pleasant prof encourages good work with positive feedback questions answered promptly if you have difficulty make you a video to show you how to competent clear instruction only way to ruin your a is to mismanage your time start early in week so you rushed training and assignments require closely following text directions
7681,Cindy  Herbert,easiest college class ive ever taken she gives a lot of small easy assignments a lot of points in this class which helps if you decide to not do one or two easy class and her being very attractive makes it easy pay attention
7682,Cindy  Herbert,a great lighthearted teacher class was very casual she has great patience and is very willing to help wants you to succeed easy a
7683,Cindy  Herbert,i highly recommend professor herbert she goes above and beyond what is expected of an instructor she allowed me to use a mac version of microsoft office it was more work for her but she was very kind great instructor and great class
7684,Cindy  Herbert,i would recommend her easy class and she is very helpful i learned a lot in this class she offers practice quizzes and extra credit and should be an easy class to pass it requires a sam program disc that is besides the books also
7685,Cindy  Herbert,i took this class online over the summer.have not received my grade but i am sure it will be an a.there is a lot of work but cindy is super helpful if you are stuck on a project.she will call you if you need her to and she responds very promptly to questions.happy i took this class online in the summer.hard work easy a if you do the work
7686,Mark  Bryan,mark bryan is an unstoppable scholarly force because he actually works as a professional playwright and actively learns from his research becoming smarter at almost the speed of time impossible to be smarter than mark bryan in the same way that impossible to be older than the universe
7687,Mark  Bryan,great professor very interesting does lecture a lot but in an interesting way that keeps the class involved
7688,Mark  Bryan,ethusiastic laidback hilarious but sure as hell knows what doing great man great class
7689,Mark  Bryan,so sexy hard to learn but you might pick up a thing or two as he is so full of information
7690,Mark  Bryan,my favorite professor at denison no one better than mark that man knows what talking about and as a young alum got some crazy denison stories
7691,Mark  Bryan,my favorite professor at denison no one better than mark that man knows what talking about and as a young alum got some crazy denison stories
7692,Mark  Bryan,great stuff the essay tests are graded a little hard the end research project is important mark is a cool guy with an animated interesting teaching style hard to find one like that great theatre teacher
7693,Mark  Bryan,i still get thinking about how hot he is
7694,Mark  Bryan,an excellent person who is downtoearth and really knows his stuff not to mention he get all profoessory on you a cool man and an intelligent one
7695,Mark  Bryan,no comments
7696,Mark  Bryan,one of the best denison has to offer and cute
7697,Mark  Bryan,an awesome prof who knows his stuff i highly recommend him
7698,Daniel  Fonseca,mixed feelings excellent at teaching the material learned tons but tests are very specific and a total time crunch will to some extent be penalized if you do not think along the exact lines that he wants you to i recommend if you want to learn but not if you are concerned about your grade
7699,Daniel  Fonseca,you have about homeworks per semester the tests are based on the concepts covered in the homeworks be afraid to go to his office hours he will try to help you without giving you the answer directly his class is challenging but you will learn something
7700,Daniel  Fonseca,he is pretty funny but can be hard to understand due to his accent costa rican i think the biggest problem i had was that we would learn the material and have homework then start learning the next topic then have the test on the previous topic a week or two into the second one more of the fault than his
7701,Daniel  Fonseca,dr fonseca has an interesting teaching style maybe the fact that this course is courses in but it was very quick and sometimes hard to keep up with despite that dan the man is a very effective teacher all the grades you receive are essential but not hard to make an a none of the tests are cumulative not even the final
7702,Daniel  Fonseca,danny fon is a great teacher if you go see him in office hours he will give you the answers to the homework final is not cumulative i would recommend taking him
7703,Daniel  Fonseca,fonseca is a fun teacher but his class can go either way it is very easy to slack off in that class as there is little hw and attendance is optional posts lectures online he is from costa rica so he has an accent if you go to class and stay on top of the material you should be fine slack off and you will regret it
7704,Daniel  Fonseca,i had dr fonseca for an honors seminar but he was very helpful and available to the students he is very quick to email back and was very generous when grading our powerpoint presentations he may be different as a regular professor but i was very satisfied with him as an honors seminar instructor
7705,Daniel  Fonseca,extremely helpful and an actual fun class a really nice professor and made you want to learn
7706,Daniel  Fonseca,great teacher he will help you outside of class take him if you can
7707,Daniel  Fonseca,one of the best teacher i have ever had
7708,Daniel  Fonseca,i know if he just hated me but he destroyed my homework grade and hit a huge dent into my gpa he docks huge points for simple mistakes even if you arrive to the correct answer so watch yourself
7709,Daniel  Fonseca,he is very clear and distinct about what he expects from you his reviews are very similar to the tests his tests are questions and he counts off a lot for little mistakes but the tests are easy if you go to class and the in class reviews
7710,Daniel  Fonseca,no comments
7711,Daniel  Fonseca,excellent best professor ever he is the greatest
7712,Bill  Babula,this passion for shakespeare only furthered my own completely fascinated by his subject and teaches with a passion totally nice guy tries to do some handson stuff which usually turns out funny highly recommended

7714,Bill  Babula,prof babula is a great teacher i truly enjoyed intro to shakespeare he made the work interesting and did works justice by showing the plays very approachable and knows his stuff i would definitely take a class by him again
7715,Bill  Babula,very interested in everything that he teaches he is open minded to student ideas and is very fair about grading there are some inclass essays but if you read and show up to class an easy a reading is a must and there is a good amount of it so if reading your thing this class for you overall a really cool prof
7716,Bill  Babula,enjoyed this class got clear understanding of the context of plays to history and culture of the time and how it is used to relate to present day recommend the class film adaptation fun to watch and compare he is a fair teacher and clear on what is expected from his class
7717,Bill  Babula,he definitely knows his shakespeare and definitely make it interesting even for the uninterested a few essays nothing too crazy you watch a lot of the movie versions which is good by my book recommended
7718,Bill  Babula,has a great deal of knowledge about shakespeare fair grader one of the best teachers at ssu
7719,Bill  Babula,good class
7720,Bill  Babula,this was a very good class with an even better teacher he is very respectful of everyone and gets across a lot of information in a short amount of time great class
7721,Bill  Babula,professor babula was very good at getting across a large ammount of information in a short period of time i would recommend this class for any beginning shakespeare students
7722,Bill  Babula,this dude freakin sucks doesnt respect different view points shows movies instead of teaching uses offensive material with no regard for the feelings of the students
7723,Bill  Babula,no comments
7724,Bill  Babula,i enjoyed getting an easy a from balbula and watching all the shakespeare films but i regret having left the class with about just as much knowledge on the bard as when i entered
7725,Bill  Babula,well done dean i still think you must have implanted a shakespeare bug in me i learned a lot and i am sure more will be revealed as time goes on perhaps best the difficult midterm and final essays are perfect practice for next cbest exam
7726,Bill  Babula,he is one of the best english teachers i have ever had i never thought that i would get shakespeare but he made it possible
7727,Bill  Babula,no comments
7728,Bill  Babula,very helpful outside of class especially to the person who is intimidated by shakespeare interesting perspectives on film productions and clear in his expectations tests are extremely reasonable
7729,Charlie  Sweet,i really cannot believe that he has any bad reviews the people who are giving him bad reviews are the lazy partying ones who hate all professors he goes out of his way for his students and is a wonderful human being i highly recommend him and suggest that college students learn that they are here to learn
7730,Charlie  Sweet,i believe this jerk one an award for teaching he is horrible overly macho and conservative made me want to change my major avoid
7731,Charlie  Sweet,i thought that this professor was horrible i dreaded going to the class everyday and when he told me that he was not sure how i had made it through college this far i wanted to tell him to kiss my ass i hated his teaching style and consider him one of the worst teachers i have ever taken
7732,Charlie  Sweet,i really enjoyed dr class he made the material interesting and fun i learned a lot and would definitely take another class from him
7733,Charlie  Sweet,he may get high reviews for me because i did think he was easy but he really got on my nerves he is a know it all and treats every story poem novel and play as if it were a mystery to be solved also if you share his opinion you are wrong class would be a lot better if he would shut up and let the students discuss the work jerk
7734,Charlie  Sweet,english is not my thing i worked harder on this class than any other and only got a b you must keep up with readings
7735,Charlie  Sweet,great teacher teaching style was interesting although his test and homework was demanding
7736,Charlie  Sweet,no comments
7737,Charlie  Sweet,one of the best professors on campus
7738,Charlie  Sweet,his tests are kinda hard but you learn a lot

7747,Hal  Blythe,no comments
7748,Hal  Blythe,great professor very fair with grades very clear on what to study for tests gives great notes and is very charismatic very approachable and seems to sincerely care about students only complaint is that you wear hats in class which sucks when running late for an a.m but then again small price to pay
7749,Hal  Blythe,kinda silly at times but a great guy and gets his point across well wonderful mentor and you can learn a lot from him if you try
7750,Hal  Blythe,i loved hal blythe wonderful professor

7758,Hal  Blythe,hal blythe is a very good teacher and he is actually interested in his students not just his job
7759,Dr. William  Neugebauer,a down to earth approachable fun super nice guy still works as an administrator has lots of stories to tell open discussions can be engaging there is some paper writing but well within reason gives options for the final project which was appreciated
7760,Dr. William  Neugebauer,a lot of reading outside of class but class itself stressful very nice and realizes that his students have lives outside the classroom
7761,Dr. William  Neugebauer,i ditto what has already been stated
7762,Dr. William  Neugebauer,spend a lot of time outside the classroom reading the text and writing summaries and a lot of time inside the classroom watching videos if you keep up with the assignments tough to fail this one
7763,Dr. William  Neugebauer,no comments
7764,John  Curra,be prepared to study a lot
7765,John  Curra,his lectures are awful go on these long rants about random things and half the time you know what he is even talking about his tests are heavy on material very tough to study for the one thing i did like about the class is the analysis paper we wrote
7766,John  Curra,if you are looking for an easy a do not take him he is a great teacher he knows what he is talking about if you go above and beyond on the world he gives you he rewards you with bonus points i would recommend him but not if you are looking for a easy grade
7767,John  Curra,dr curra is a great person he really knows what he is talking about unfortunately he will lecture from the start to the end of class without taking a break there is so much information and a lot of it is unclear his tests are extremely hard take him if you are looking for an easy a
7768,John  Curra,great professor and probably one of the most intellegent teachers ever met the test however are extreamly hard and you are expected to remember a lot to pass
7769,John  Curra,dr curra really cares for his students he is very helpful and will do whatever it takes to help and encourage his students to succeed yes the tests can be hard just read the material and pay attention to his lectures and do fine he knows what talking about and a very intelligent individual communicate with do great
7770,John  Curra,animated intelligent humorous clear expectations takes notes read prepare for exams and make a good grade do not expect to pass without being diligent the best professor i have ever taken including graduate school
7771,John  Curra,great guy but horrible professor he does not teach from the book he likes to pull from his previous lectures even though it is not always correct according to the book like i said great all around guy but horrible at teaching
7772,John  Curra,i did not get the grade i wanted and he is difficult but he knows what he is talking about very smart man to get an a in the class you have to keep up with readings does give study guides though which are some what helpful
7773,John  Curra,best professor i ever had nearly convinced me to change my major to sociology he made a couple of the most difficult classes i had also the most enjoyable arrogant yes charming yes inspirational that too probably would have inspired me to like algebra too if he had taught it
7774,John  Curra,straight facts his tests are difficult he usually never has on which class you take he will share information or images from criminal minds with you that you will find no where else and he will make you grow as a major he is hard but necessary attend class and you will pass excellent professor
7775,John  Curra,this is the worst professor had in my entire college career i am an a student but never been so frustrated he drones for hours about nothing but expects us you to know everything plus stuff he covered come test time he is not helpful and is arrogant the study guides for tests are also over pages with uncovered material
7776,John  Curra,this was the worst professor i have had in my entire college career i am an a student and i have never been more frustrated and aggravated with a class or proffessor he is a terrible lecturer and he drones on and on for three hours about nothing of importance but expects us to know everything come test time his study guides were over pages
7777,John  Curra,fantastic professor probably the best ever had very informative and entertaining lots to read and lots of notes to take but if you do your part he will do his he no longer teaches soc131 as moving to the crim jus side of campus but if you have the chance to take a class of his you regret it
7778,John  Curra,very interesting man with lots of things to talk about in class a good teacher but you only get grades for tests he does give extra credit sometimes but you have to attend class to get it also gives study guides for everything
7779,John  Curra,he is a fun professor but there is a lot of reading to keep up with
7780,John  Curra,he is probably my favorite professor on campus you have to work hard but it pays off at the end of the semester read the books there are a ton of questions from them on the exams enjoy
7781,John  Curra,wonderful professor class will be difficult if you read alot of reading is required you will be amazed by him he is so animated and is a wealth of knowledge course uses books he has on reserve at library if you dont want to buy them at end of semester you do murder profile highly reccommend just be reasdy to work in his class
7782,John  Curra,great class but a lot of reading to keep up with
7783,John  Curra,dr curra is the best professor ever had pay attention take good notes and read what he tells you and you will do fine
7784,Charles  O\'Brien,i overall enjoyed class however he is pretty disorganized at times he does drone on often like people say but i really appreciate how passionate he is about what hes talking about hes flexible with late papers but hes also a tough grader people complain about him being boring but hes a really nice professor and an invested guy
7785,Charles  O\'Brien,yes a bit of a low talker it help that he leaves the door open but i found him to be very nice and helpful with regards to assignments some of the lectures tended to drag a little from time to time but he did a good job of laying out the structure of the course as well as explaining his expectations for our papers and exams
7786,Charles  O\'Brien,mixed feeling he is really nice but his voice is just too quiet and i cannot follow from time to time because of that
7787,Charles  O\'Brien,he is just a lovely person excellent oneonone so take advantage of office hours softspoken so you have to really listen but his lectures are always incredibly thorough and interesting he also seems genuinely interested in what students have to say his laugh is also the most adorable sound heard out of a grown man highly recommend him
7788,Charles  O\'Brien,make sure you either do the readings and look over powerpoint slides or attend every class you have to do both a very straightforward course with a midterm exam final paper and final exam if you plan on attending the classes be sure you sit close to him because is very very quiet
7789,Charles  O\'Brien,best pick for supervisor provides detailed feedback very respected and insightful lectures get long and tedious but he provides you with all the info you need for essays read the material for multiple choice not just slides sweetest prof on st pats often given the street name obrizzle because he is our homeboy we love him
7790,Charles  O\'Brien,really into musical films and gives very clear lectures but he can be rather repetitive and drag on subjects also he is incredibly softspoken sometimes you hear him over the central heating he uploads lecture slides and assigns readings study all that and you barely have to come in for class
7791,Charles  O\'Brien,hes an overall great guy passion for films is evidently conveyed through lectures and comments he has helped me become more critical in my analyzing of films and has created my love for french new wave cinema
7792,Charles  O\'Brien,he really loves film but he makes you hate it he can talk forever and he can really put you to sleep for anyone who loves to sleep i recommend this class
7793,Charles  O\'Brien,professor is awesome such a kind and calm guy take a class again with him in a heartbeat and yes he talks quietly listen well worth it
7794,Charles  O\'Brien,he had this peter parker kent quality about hom that was soo sweet his class was awesome
7795,Charles  O\'Brien,often torn on my opinion of this guy he takes a very practical historical approach to film studies which is refreshing considering how bogged down his department is in heavy theory fascinating and useful research interests but so quiet he barely seems to even be there at times he lecture so much as recite lullabies
7796,Charles  O\'Brien,charles never had i had such mixed feelings about a prof he is a very nice guy who i believe cares about his students yes he is a little awkward and stutters a bit and convey his ideas with clarity or precision but he is easygoing unless you talk and plans the course out nicely the exams are super easy multiple choice
7797,Charles  O\'Brien,not a bad prof movies are standard film studies stuff super easy exams everything is from the texbook essays are pretty fair if you do the readings and watch the movies online you even have to come to class i skipped the entire second semester and got an a
7798,Charles  O\'Brien,possibly the coolest prof ever and he even know it he is really into his teaching but can get boring sometimes and put you to sleep midterms and exams all multiple choice and easy the a genius who always wears jean jackets d
7799,Charles  O\'Brien,a fun course but wow the lectures are dull too bad because he seems so into what saying but the vast majority of his lectures are from the textbook still he knows what talking about and posts the notes online thank goodness some slides hold multiple paragraphs worth taking his class but bring along a coffee
7800,Charles  O\'Brien,i once even saw his fall asleep and then wake up at the end drooling he puts everyone asleep
7801,Charles  O\'Brien,his voice puts me to sleep and when i am discussing his points with fellow classmates someone always shushes me because is talking about a quotation taken from a book talking about a reviewer of the director of the movie were watching hes a dud and he cancelled blade runner
7802,Charles  O\'Brien,great prof always really into his lectures extremely approachable and helpful no suprises in exams or essays as long as you attend and keep up with class lectures very knowledgable
7803,Charles  O\'Brien,super great class
7804,Tracy  Chapple,tracy is awesome if you have the chance to take one of her classes you should i also felt like i understood the content of the class and ended the course more knowledgeable she doesnt make class stressful and she wants you to do well tracy is a good role model
7805,Tracy  Chapple,shocker she actually makes you read the textbooks this does not feel so scandalous to me in fact you actually come out learning something think of her classes as a book club you read sit in a circle and muse over material most lazy students will thumb through their unread book during class to find something to say ah well
7806,Tracy  Chapple,i know what the others are complaining about tracy is very clear we had no test in my class she is into group discussions but she tries to get you to think about the material i heard guy say she teach him but he was the guy who begged answers off people and tried to cheat his way through school tracy is patient knowledgeable
7807,Tracy  Chapple,teacher provide much help she clear on what she wants and would rather her students copy from the book than put what they learned
7808,Tracy  Chapple,ugh very unclear about what she actually wants would rather have students unknowingly quote stuff directly from the book than try to understand it in their own words tests are unclear not very understanding of circumstances beyond your control normally like psych but very disinterested with this shame
7809,Tracy  Chapple,she never taught at all just put us in groups i totally disagree with the other comments saying she is easy her tests have nothing to do with what she has talked about in class would not ever take another class from her again but she seemed like a nice lady nun the less
7810,Tracy  Chapple,talked about the book provided no real world explanations to abnormal psy showed movies to try and get the point across was way too much into group work
7811,Tracy  Chapple,anyone needing a psy class should take tracy she makes class fun and tailors her classes according to the overall character of each class she pays attention to what is going on with everyone and helps out however she can tracy rocks
7812,Tracy  Chapple,an excellent instructor do your reading participate in class and make very understanding and flexible
7813,Tracy  Chapple,if you read the textbook and understand the meaning behind the group activities you will do very well in her class
7814,Tracy  Chapple,no comments
7815,Tracy  Chapple,very nice and understanding good teacher fun
7816,Tracy  Chapple,should teach more and have fewer group activities to fill time
7817,Tracy  Chapple,should consider providing more intellectual depth to her classes superficial teaches the textbook
7818,Tracy  Chapple,no comments
7819,Kelli  Carmean,if you are a beware to hear some controversial things pretty straight forward on what she wants from you your grade is based on book quizzes and film quizzes a nice and caring person but can sometimes inject her opinion too much everything is basically online except the midterm and final
7820,Kelli  Carmean,dr carmean is a great professor and excited to take another class with her worksheet on a minute film and a quiz over the book every week no actual textbook but you do have to read two books show up to class take it seriously you will be better off for it
7821,Kelli  Carmean,she is an amazing professor she is passionate about her field she loves her students she is always available to talk in her office
7822,Kelli  Carmean,she is an amazing professor she is passionate about her field she loves her students
7823,Kelli  Carmean,carmean makes it very clear what is required to get an a if you do what she says and do it well an a is pretty much guaranteed take good notes carmean really loves this subject and she enjoys it when students express interest or enjoyment as well if you go into the class with a good attitude go a lot better
7824,Kelli  Carmean,writing this mostly as a rebuttal to the last comment posted i worked on the final by myself received an a on it as well as for the final course grade granted it took me around hours to complete attend class take notes pay attention ask questions if unsure of something dr carmean is a good professor
7825,Kelli  Carmean,passionate professor the work is tedious but straight forward and not too difficult she is a good professor however certain no one made an a as her take home final was absolutely unreasonable the entire class had worked on their final together with a worth of notes collectively and all came out with low and
7826,Kelli  Carmean,if your gonna do ant she is the teacher to go with her passion for the subject shines through her teaching making me care about the subject her teaching style grabs attention and is easily understood you will need to read guns germs and steel but because she broke it down weekly its not as painful
7827,Kelli  Carmean,awful she still uses a chalk board writes notes that are impossible to follow draws pictures instead of using powerpoint or other forms of technology and is totally full of herself i cannot stand this woman the final exam has absolutely nothing to do with what we learned in class
7828,Kelli  Carmean,kelli loves anthropology and it is easy to see through her teaching the first day of my first class was intimidating because she really throws the work at you but i believe just to let you know this is not an easy a class fellows i ended up taking a class from her every year i was at i guess you could say i like her pretty good
7829,Kelli  Carmean,marxist feminest arrogant her classes are more about her political agenda than the science of archaeology too bad she is the only archaeologist on the faculty at eku
7830,Kelli  Carmean,her notes are impossible to follow she writes all over the bored and never finishes a thought whenever you ask a question regarding an answer on a test she sayd consider it for next semester i would not recommend her
7831,Kelli  Carmean,she is really nice and very enthusiastic about teaching she made boring subjects beyond interesting the class was challenging no textbook but i learned a lot if you like anth take it she is cool
7832,Kelli  Carmean,she is super nice and helpful the class is really interesting because dr carmean created it herself she loves her job and is always willing to help if you do the reading and review your notes before the exams be fine she like grading so all the exams are multiple choise she posts grades really fast too great teacher
7833,Kelli  Carmean,really nice lady she is very enthusiastic about what she does her class is very hard but i learned alot and she is a great teacher you just have to work hard if you want a good grade
7834,Kelli  Carmean,wonderful professor she is very energetic and driven no homework other than reading takes attendance randomly gives study guides for her tests the only downside is the amount of reading required there are three books that must be read and read carefully for this class i suggest you make a friend in the class and study for the book exams
7835,Kelli  Carmean,nice but pretty crazy guns germs and steel tests are horrible and the tests are hard and seriously she is certifiable but in a nice way
7836,Kelli  Carmean,she is super sweet but her class is hard there is a nest test book we had to do and it was really difficult to predict what questions would be on there so you know which point of the book to really pay attention to but over all great just make sure you do all the work assigned including the study guide
7837,Kelli  Carmean,dr carmean is my academic advisor and has helped me in so many ways her classes are by no means easy but they are a lot of fun you can tell that she really gets into some anthropology if you have the chance you should take her actually make it a point to take her you will not regret it but you will work hard
7838,Kelli  Carmean,wonderful professor very clear about what she expects and very helpful seems to enjoy teaching and wants her students to learn and understand the material
7839,Courtney  Fairweather,the instructor focused more on criticising students than helping them to learn and succeed thus i was not at all satisfied with her approach to treating students particularly those who did not speak english as their mother tongue or those who did not have a background in learning english especially with resect to writing
7840,Courtney  Fairweather,she marks too hard for the quality of her classes and her overall knowledge as an esl instructor is poor her explanations are vague her spelling terrible and she deducts marks for corrections that people at the writing centre make on your essays her comments will not help you at all she gives you whatever grade she wants to horrible
7841,Courtney  Fairweather,very interesting person and class is always interesting too
7842,Courtney  Fairweather,she is organized in her lectures and her assignments are pretty straightforward take notes of whatever she mentions in class she grades students on participation too so make an effort to participate in class daily her exams are based on lecture material covered in class so attending class is very important
7843,Courtney  Fairweather,take her course if you want get high marks she never give high marks
7844,Courtney  Fairweather,very boring class
7845,Courtney  Fairweather,she is very interesting and tells you about different people in canada in a very friendly way it is an interesting class
7846,Courtney  Fairweather,great interesting
7847,Courtney  Fairweather,she acts nice but she likes certain students if you start to get b or that means she just does not like you you will find a lot of people getting a or in the course just for being a friend with her if you get into any type of argument your grades will get lower
7848,Courtney  Fairweather,great
7849,Courtney  Fairweather,she is strict about cell phones and stuff but she teaches how to write you should take her course
7850,Courtney  Fairweather,very kind considerate respects her students and expects respect in return allow baseball hats cell phones people resting their feet on the seat in front of them late comers gives full attention and expects the same from her students in addition very stylish elegant and beautiful great teacher when students behave accordingly
7851,Courtney  Fairweather,at the beginning its like she is hard but really really nice
7852,Courtney  Fairweather,you can get a really good mark if you always go to the class but miss because she asks questions from the class in the exam
7853,Courtney  Fairweather,she is very fair and gives good grades but if you are academic dishonesty she will catch you
7854,Courtney  Fairweather,i learn a lot about multiculturalism very interesting
7855,Courtney  Fairweather,wow what surprise that canada is very interesting
7856,Courtney  Fairweather,i could not pass the course if courtney help me so much very nice person
7857,Courtney  Fairweather,wow you should try to get in her class because she really helps a lot and really glad she teaches how to write good essay
7858,Courtney  Fairweather,i learned so much about canada and courtney made me feel not so worried in a new country
7859,Mortez  Aabdollah,what a funny guy yet such a horrible professor all he does is draw little figures and mumble tests and final are take home teach all he care about is project project project worst part is he teaches major classes and he is only professor for both of them
7860,Mortez  Aabdollah,i have had few classes with dr aabdullah after first class i took with him i was looking for classes he was taking in next semester so that i can avail them very helpful and has clarity in teaching would go extra mile to explain something if students are not following
7861,Mortez  Aabdollah,he is the reason i changed schools this is the poorest computer science experience had i suggest that other students complain to higherups about him change majors or go elsewhere for cs i wonder why this department is doing so poorly when this area should be booming
7862,Mortez  Aabdollah,the worst professor so far at cs department he cannot teach tell you why he draws little figures on the board while mumbling something and expects to see notes he picks on random students sometimes one student a lot and asks a question to put you on the spot if you answer correctly assume your grade from that
7863,Mortez  Aabdollah,class was overall easy the professor responded quickly to emails and was helping
7864,Mortez  Aabdollah,purely the only professor in njcu who knows his computer science i am not joking he is the best thing in that department three tests which includes midterm and finals in the three tests projects are really simple wants work but because of him i got a job as a software engineer i cant thank him enough for all his help to me never stop teaching
7865,Mortez  Aabdollah,great guy but very bad teacher does not know how to teach at all he talks as if everything he says should be common sense
7866,Mortez  Aabdollah,awesome teacher i recommend him
7867,Mortez  Aabdollah,took the online course it may seem like a lot of work but its not that difficult take his class if possible
7868,Mortez  Aabdollah,for all non major students take him he is crystal clear in his syllabus for homework and tests and will help you learn he treats you like an adult that you are and he will give you an a atleast for effort
7869,Mortez  Aabdollah,easy class eventhough the prof had some difficultes in talking sometimes unclear overall good class spirit
7870,Mortez  Aabdollah,he is a lovely older man easy going and friendly teaches you as though you were an adult test come from the hw directly i recommend him for an easy and enjoyable class
7871,Mortez  Aabdollah,i took prof cs115 online class he was crystal clear in his directions and he responded to emails quickly and in a respectful manner i suggest taking his class and i think twice about taking an inclass couse also
7872,Mortez  Aabdollah,wonderful person easy class you have to really try to fail this class
7873,Mortez  Aabdollah,a very nice man that give you a lot of hassle he treats you like an adult homework and exam come from the questions at the end of each chapter in the book his english is not the best but anyone can excel easily in his class if you do the hw i highly recommend him
7874,Mortez  Aabdollah,professor gives a lot of work but he is really easy very kind if you do your work you will get an a
7875,Mortez  Aabdollah,he is a good professor lots of hw test are directly from hw gives you extra time to make up any hw missed curves
7876,Mortez  Aabdollah,horrible
7877,Mortez  Aabdollah,the class was rather simple so long as you did the homework each week which was just answering the questions at the end of each chapter you will pass tests consisted of of the homework questions there was one relatively short paper that was on a topic he gives you it was a pretty easy class to fill an area
7878,Mortez  Aabdollah,a difficult professor if lazy like me lots of homework and the tests are from the hw final project seemed difficult based on what i saw others do i do it but still passed only because i handed in literally chapters of past homework on the last day not the worst cs professor but i take him again
7879,Michael  Suetta,great class but make sure you attand lectures and have anyone signin for you because i did it and i got into some trubles my grades when down a lot because of that overall i loved his class it was fun and i recommend everyone to take it
7880,Michael  Suetta,this was probably the easiest class of all four years and very fun he tries to get to know the students but really know all so you could just get a friend to sign you in and you would be marked present he definitely knows his facts so make sure your powerpoints have lots of pics of the correct places
7881,Michael  Suetta,very easy class just make sure you study for his tests and hand in the paper on time class is interesting he can be kind of boring though sometimes great professor
7882,Michael  Suetta,one of my fav teachers in the university so easy no homework but you have like or projects there easy too he says attendance is mandatory and u get cuts or he lowers your grade but thats not completely true unless you miss a lott so easy def reccommend takin this class
7883,Michael  Suetta,suetta is the best teacher around just go to class and pay attention he makes you want to pay attention funny guy
7884,Michael  Suetta,he is the best history teacher i have ever had he is the man if you want an easy a take suetta
7885,Michael  Suetta,he is the best history teacher i have ever had he is the man if you want an easy a take suetta

7887,Michael  Suetta,suetta is the man
7888,Michael  Suetta,he really makes you think about what is around you absolutely teacher
7889,Michael  Suetta,one awsome teacher
7890,Michael  Suetta,this guy was so cool it makes me wanna be an asian
7891,Michael  Suetta,this class is awesome he is really entertaining with his lectures interesting and easy
7892,Michael  Suetta,interesting class but uses a powerpoint very nice teacher easy grader very easy tests and two also easy papers to write take it
7893,Michael  Suetta,i love suetta
7894,Michael  Suetta,lectures were fairly boring with a few corny jokes thrown in takes attendence every day which is the only reason i went to class he was actually rude to me when i would say hello to him outside of class he have a clue who i was so he would just ignore me great study directions easy tests
7895,Michael  Suetta,really nice prob the nicest prof ever had and really informative if he still shows the movie about the noodle watch out because have a ton of fun watching it and be quite surprised i def reccommend him
7896,Michael  Suetta,the best professor i miss his class ever i like his stories he knows so much about east asia i highly recommend this class
7897,Michael  Suetta,makes an otherwise boring subject interesting and fun i wouldnt miss his class if u paid me
7898,Michael  Suetta,this was the best class in the world never wanted to go to a lecture so much hilarious guy but lectures so well you enjoy it and remember everything take east asia
7899,Martin  Bakker,my high school football coach could teach better than this man attendance is taken through clicker quizzes that have huge effect on grades he is extremely rude on and belittles students no formula sheet so good luck memorizing all the equations for the final i guess studying hrs for the final good enough to pass averages rip
7900,Martin  Bakker,bakker is rude and condescending but his class too hard he moves fast and thoroughly explain everything but the book does and his tests overly complicated he does lots of clicker quizzes which can be stressful at times
7901,Martin  Bakker,martin is very difficult so if not taking this for future classes beware probably the best out of all profs but you need to do so many extra practice probs to pass study before the test no matter what he can be rude but you need to put it the work he is the best balance so if you need future chem do it
7902,Martin  Bakker,i had him for both and if taking as an elective or as an engineering major do not take him if premed or chemistry related major power through and you will learn a ton which helps in later courses tests are hard but if you put in the work and do a lot of practice problems doable
7903,Martin  Bakker,great teacher kind of rude at points but you will definitely know chemistry by the end he is hard but fair and makes you work for your grade you get formula sheets for the test but with enough practice fairly easy to remember take this guy if you can
7904,Martin  Bakker,dr bakker is very prepared for lectures and is great about answering questions in class and outside of class he loves to see his students putting in effort so go to office hours when you have questions and attend as many recitations as possible his quizzes there help a lot too use all extra problems he gives and it will help for the tests
7905,Martin  Bakker,a good lecturer if not a bit arrogant the kind of professor you hate to have while you have him but will be grateful for after you leave him however only recommend his class if going to being using chemistry in future courses it was a lot of effort and very stressful
7906,Martin  Bakker,this guy is awful he insults people in class and makes a fuss if anyone asks him to work a problem has clicker questions every class period and only gives half credit to wrong answers even though an attendance grade tests were ridiculously difficult and he never curved even though test averages were in the rudest prof ever had
7907,Martin  Bakker,if you ask a question in class there is a big chance he will condescend to you in front of everyone and you will never ask another question again you go through the homework and feel like you will do well just to bomb tests part of why the tests are so awful is because he provide any formulas or constants unlike every other professor
7908,Martin  Bakker,avoid if possible he is very smart he knows it often being rude to students in class and answering questions with other questions if you taken ap chem he is not the prof for you his hw impossible if you start ahead of time but i study understand the material attend every class and still do badly on his tests
7909,Martin  Bakker,dr bakker is as good of a chemistry teacher as it gets honestly he uploads class lectures and does a great job explaining the math side of the class which is normally where chemistry teachers struggle alot of people have dropped or have bad grades but this isnt an easy class but if you put in effort you will do fine highly recommend
7910,Martin  Bakker,dr bakker gets a lot of negative reviews but i absolutely loved him he can be a bit condescending if you ask stupid questions but do the reading and an easy a he teaches straight from the textbook so i recommend reading ahead of time then going to lecture to clear up anything that confused on
7911,Martin  Bakker,make sure you do as many practice problems as you can to prepare for the test the test will be much harder then other classes so study and put in the hours there is no clear grading criteria even though he says there is in the syllabus i still have no idea what my final numeric grade was take a different professor if at all possible
7912,Martin  Bakker,take another teacher do problems in class make sarcastic comments about how much faster he can do them tests much harder with trick questions than other sections u get to use formula sheet on final you might learn more in his class but you are unlikely to get in a unless had ap chem and grading criteria not clear
7913,Martin  Bakker,dr bakker is a very tough teacher but he knows what he is talking about and will prepare you well for future classes if you put the work in all the basics for the tests are in the powerpoints but in order to do well you need to do a lot of practice problems definitely take if just taking for a science elective
7914,Martin  Bakker,dr class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly during class he tries to be funny but often goes over as rude and demeaning he has many times worked a problem out on the board and not explained where he gets the numbers from he seems like a brilliant man but not very good at teaching i recommend taking him
7915,Martin  Bakker,he is very condescending drops your lowest test grade expects a lot out of his students and the ones who try come out with an incredible amount of knowledge
7916,Martin  Bakker,i had dr bakker for both and and it was one of the hardest classes i have ever had to take he expects a lot and pushes his students to the limit i hated his class and thought it was very hard but i learned a lot more than other students with other teachers which will and has helped me with other classes
7917,Martin  Bakker,gives lectures mostly on concepts and theory with very few example problems and expects you to learn how to do most problems on your own he does clicker questions for a grade every class i would not recommend him to anyone who does not have a strong chemistry background he also gives no equation sheets for exams
7918,Martin  Bakker,while he does not give as much homework as some of the other professors he likes to assign it on a very short deadline i.e finish the chapter on monday homework is pushed up to be due that wednesday attendance was required as he gave in class clicker questions everyday that count as participation but also are graded kinda sassy guy
7919,Daphne  Huntley,she is super easy and hilarious the only negative thing was that her grading on the essays was very inconsistent i would take her again though because you really have to focus in there outside of class lol
7920,Daphne  Huntley,she is the most awesome english teacher that i have ever had her class is easy and fun she is hilarious and always cracks the students up mostly we only wrote essay and turned inclass work in for homework our tests were inclass essays
7921,Daphne  Huntley,the best english teacher at nacc dr huntley is funny intelligent thorough and interesting if you hate english like me take her learn but have fun doing it also wear alabama colors
7922,Daphne  Huntley,she is hilarious and a great teacher i learned more in there than my high school english class on essay papers she sometimes let the students out early which is cool for me make sure you follow the guidelines she gives to essay papers to make an a
7923,Daphne  Huntley,ask too much detail in her and if u dnt have it she will minus every point till u have em

7932,Daphne  Huntley,dr huntley is a wonderful instructor not a former lawyer our final exam was an inclass research paper inspiring teacher and true friend
7933,Daphne  Huntley,love this lady if your not a good writer like me she explains everything well it also helps you when writing papers for other classes
7934,Daphne  Huntley,boo au but hooray dr huntley best overall teacher nacc in my opinion i had dr h in both english lit classes register asap to get in her classes
7935,Daphne  Huntley,i loved dr classes i always looked for the classes she taught because i knew they would be interesting and easy as long as i applied myself i highly recommend
7936,Daphne  Huntley,great teacher
7937,Daphne  Huntley,no comments
7938,Daphne  Huntley,dr h is an amazing teacher funny insightful and she knows her material expect to work hard and study often she likes students to be involved in class discussions she play around with work she assigns you complete
7939,Ronald  Robel,very strange but if you get on his good side prosper in the class you have to write like him in order to make a good grade tests are relatively easy while papers have to be deadon accurate
7940,Ronald  Robel,quirky character but once you get past his eccentricities a great professor and really does care about his students he even took our whole class out to lunch one day he just tolerate people with a halfhearted interest in the subject very well firm grader excellent lecturer good material to know in world affairs these days
7941,Ronald  Robel,pretty funny but odd guy has been teaching here for years insensitive but kindhearted he wanted us to call him uncle ron the class easy but he helps you out some extras and stuff
7942,Ronald  Robel,dr robel is a difficult professor to like he insults and belittles his students and he is inflexible in his opinions however he is an engaging lecturer who generally kept me interested i believe he does care for his students it just show
7943,Ronald  Robel,he is a great lecturer he loves teaching and it shows
7944,Ronald  Robel,dr robel is an excellent professor his teaching methods are inspiring fun and enthusiastic
7945,Ronald  Robel,no comments
7946,Brennda  Young,good teacher tough grader essays for mini semester classes she will tell you straight up in you face whatever you need to do and i loved that about her just take her and dedicate your time your in college for reason you will learn
7947,Brennda  Young,this lecturer was not there online she marked our very first essay but then disappeared until three days to the end she then hurriedly graded our work but because she had not been there to instruct us we had made no improvements in our work only two students completed the research paper by last day of semester
7948,Brennda  Young,i am still in her class now so i will rate her again once i am finished very thorough with explanations course work is not too hard but it is challenging instructor helps when needed and is very quick with responses
7949,Brennda  Young,very tuff class you must work hard and she expects a lot from the class lots of essays to write and the final paper is words you must study and read
7950,Brennda  Young,i learned a lot from dr young she likes students who ask a lot of questions and take the initiative themselves
7951,Brennda  Young,ms.young is a great professor i have learned so much from attending her class you must be willing to work hard but in the end you will feel confident with english i highly recommend ms class
7952,Brennda  Young,ms young is a great teacher she is extremely helpful and very responsive to any questions she lets you learn and does not expect you to be perfect she lets you revise your paper to make a better grade
7953,Brennda  Young,she was awesome took her online she responed quickly and prompt she gives you a second chance to edit and revise if necessary awesome for an online class
7954,Brennda  Young,ms young is a great teacher if your a slacker waste your time but if you like writing honest critiques and good conversations great take her you will learn about literary culture and how to improve your writing
7955,Brennda  Young,just go head and take her class dont ask too much questions in her class

7962,Brennda  Young,dr young is a great teacher if you are willing to put in the effort on her assignments she grades reasonably and is always willing to help if you need it
7963,Brennda  Young,she is a really good techer everyone looked forward to her class but be prepared to have your essays read aloud in the class and picked at but it will essentially help you to become a better writer when you know that your peers will view your paper
7964,Brennda  Young,dr young is a great professor she picks through papers reads them aloud not to embarrass you but to help you see hear your mistakes show others in the class what mistakes they made very cool but you will have an essay every week but she allows you to talk about things you like so not too hard grade a teacher
7965,Brennda  Young,she will try and scare you early on your first paper will be read aloud as she picks it apart and tries to embarass you you wont have to read a thing if you know how to go to cliffnotes.com or pinkmonkey.com.its better than reading that garbage she has selected for the readings

7970,Lynn  Zeigler,z is a great teacher knowledgeable passionate for her subject her lectures are clear to the point and often hilarious surprised by how much i learned bec the class seems so casual but i found myself retaining most of the material its been almost a year since i took her class and i can still identify rocks and minerals on the fly
7971,Lynn  Zeigler,professor is both knowledgeable and caring she wants her students to succeed and is willing to work with you the book need it for the test and quizzes also if you can take her for both lecture and lab hurry her classes fill up fast
7972,Lynn  Zeigler,best teacher ever willing to help test are exactly the powerpoints and in class discussion scantron test give up to on the adverage at the end of the semester dont have tobuy the book great if ur not good at science
7973,Lynn  Zeigler,she is awesome material is on power point she gives you what to study on all quizzes midterm and test.do exactly what she says extra credit is easy portfolio is optional and apart of extra credit

7998,Pat  Zrolka,she is very helpful if you come to class everyday she will give you extra credit on the final ask her fir questions and she will gladly help you math is tough but she will help you understand it
7999,Pat  Zrolka,this is one of the best teachers had since coming to gpc she is patient and gives so many chances to make a better grade she has bonuses coming out her ears he demenor is pleseant she will only get mad when most the clas fails the test if you like math you should take her yes should she will get you through it oh and no homework
8000,Pat  Zrolka,ms.zorlka is the best precal teacher she is very clear and makes sure everyone understands whats going on we use the textbook for homework so you can get an understanding which i advise she is very clear and always lets you revise your test and get extra points we have projects and she gives extra credit she is a wonderful teacher
8001,Pat  Zrolka,she is a great professor i did not have a book in her class and made an a she uses mymathlab now and homework grades are easy take lots of notes and attend class

8005,Pat  Zrolka,her class notes are easy to understand but when she assigns the homework its not what was explained in class notes i feel that she should do some of the even homework problems in class with us so that we can understand the homework better
8006,Shelly  Hancock,professor does not tell students about online projects due expects you to see something on blackboard hope for your sake you log on everyday gives feedback on a paper and if you fix it still gives negative feedback for paper somewhat scattered on what she tells students would not recommend
8007,Shelly  Hancock,failed to give constructive feedback on assignments that could be useful for improvement
8008,Shelly  Hancock,great professor tells you to the smallest detail what she expects in her papers as long as you try you will get a good grade
8009,Shelly  Hancock,i loved that woman so much that i even put it into words hands down one of the best instructors i have ever had in my life she is not unreasonable in any way she gives you clear instructions and pushes you to not be a procrastinator she is incredibly lively and hilarious and her lectures are rarely boring take her course it
8010,Shelly  Hancock,a wonderful professor intimidating at first but very kind she provides clarity on all her assignments i would highly recommend her
8011,Shelly  Hancock,one of the best teachers had she is funny smart and cheerful she cares about her students and her job her assignments hard and if they are she makes them as clear as can be i loved her
8012,Shelly  Hancock,shelly hancock is one of my favorite instructors here at bctc she is so lively and passionate he classes are almost never boring sometimes in her class i felt as if my older sister was teaching me she is just so friendly and fair she gives you a hard time on essays but because she cares about you she wants you to become your best
8013,Shelly  Hancock,she is one of the best teachers so far she is very helpful when she is grading she comments what is wrong about the paper so it will become better very wish i had taken her for but sadly i
8014,Shelly  Hancock,a good teacher and a nice person but the book she chose which is about black women in the civil rights movement is not at all my preference but then i am probably the most politically incorrect person i know
8015,Shelly  Hancock,she does everything but write the paper for you i actually feel like i learned something in her class and had fun doing it
8016,Shelly  Hancock,helpful teacher to any student and is easy to understand
8017,Shelly  Hancock,took her for far the best teacher.her classes get full easy so sign up early.if you come to class and do what she will get a b easy.if you need help she is there easy to talk to extremely funny be discouraged by her loud voice if you struggle in english take her
8018,Shelly  Hancock,everyone should take classes she is a wonderful teacher who works hard with you hilarious as well

8020,Shelly  Hancock,shes super cool
8021,Shelly  Hancock,highly recommend her came out of class being able to write good college papers assignments can be unusual but it makes you think about what you are going to write available for help can phone at home during weekends evenings and holidays will help you expand your thought process

8025,Shelly  Hancock,a little over the top to the point where even say annoying obnoxious and loud which can be cool but only in moderation sitting through an hour and a half class twice a week was a bit too much of shelly for me
8026,Raines  Carter,dont take him u will regret it if you care about your gpa his class may seem easy at first but its really not he tells u what will be on the test before hand but most of the things he says are not even on there totally not worth it
8027,Raines  Carter,academically i would say a great teacher to take but he is a shady person he started a conflict in the class with a student who did nothing to anyone i guess he agree with his point of view but sending a email off to everyone in class like your trying to get the person kicked out of school which is what he did was a bit extreme
8028,Raines  Carter,take this guy he is one of the best professors i have ever had i learned so much from him he is extremely funny and he will tell what is on his exams even on my exams in the free response section there were times when i made up the answer and i was still given credit like i said take this guy

8046,Fredoline O  Annunobi,mr annunobi was a funny teacher his class was very easy i got an a out of the class i hardly study for his class i never did my homework the tests were fairly easy
8047,Fredoline O  Annunobi,dr annunobi is a nice funny teacher his tests can be hard at times but overall he is a great teacher big on attendance but if you show up for every single class and do the work its easy to pass also get on his good side he wont fail you at all then
8048,Fredoline O  Annunobi,his accent really bother me because i know i have one too mr annunobi likes those that talk in and answer questions if you are not a talking kind of person please take him great teacher he knows his stuff u gonna pass him anyway
8049,Fredoline O  Annunobi,a hard of his accent at times hard to understand he knows this already but when he assings homework he rarely collects them if you have patience and alot of time you might pass this class with a c but if you need a good gpa go to another campus and take this class
8050,Fredoline O  Annunobi,mr anunobi thinks he knows everything which happen not to be true his tests are so trickish if u know how to answer questions and talk in class.take him
8051,Fredoline O  Annunobi,very very unhelpful he is the political science department head of decatur campus and when complaints are brought to him he does nothing to help the students he puts on a show infront of the class raising the expectations of the class he is going to do something but he never does a thing

8056,Beryl  Kalisa,she did not put any grades in the system the entire semester i see how i was doing until the final grade went in and even then i see what i did wrong
8057,Beryl  Kalisa,it is almost finals week we have two tests for grades and we had to go visit a museum on student study day btw she cancelled the trip to the museum at in the morning and then told us to go anyway for a grade no real office hours just catch her there is no h.w you must participate in the class discussions she uses the word stupid alot
8058,Beryl  Kalisa,a nice sweet teacher even though her lectures can be a tad boring funny and tries to lighten up the class if none of the students participates her tests really match of what she lectures you just have to read the whole chapter to get the answers
8059,Beryl  Kalisa,hardest teacher ever
8060,Beryl  Kalisa,she speaks softly and does not teach what is on her tests one time we spent days on one chapter and there was one question on the test about it she picks favorites with students and does not do well with questions if you ask her a question it turns into a argument
8061,Beryl  Kalisa,good teacher grades fairly and gives many opportunities to students to do well a little quirky but overall a good instructor she likes lots of oral discussion and writing show up participate in class and complete assignments they will help on exams
8062,Beryl  Kalisa,lecturelecturelecture it sounds boring but if you stay awake in class and read a few handouts never need to open your book or study what you hear is what you get so just sit there listen and get an a she likes participation and truly old school so show some respect and understanding for her style and read your syllabus
8063,Beryl  Kalisa,worse teachers ever very confusing she be all over the place very hard to understand if u into this the teacher for u
8064,Beryl  Kalisa,i am not a fan of history so her teaching made it a little harder to like it she takes weeks to just get through pages and we would have an exam in week and barely covered the chapter what she reviews does not match the test when you take her class just read ahead of the class to past the tests she is a nice lady but not a good teacher
8065,Beryl  Kalisa,the worst teacher ever had hands down she doesnt start her lessons until weeks into the semester and she grades by how much she likes you i made all and on the and somehow i ended up with a c in the class expect to gain anything from this class how does this woman have a job
8066,Beryl  Kalisa,awful never even stands to teach study guides match tests removes information like the mexicanamerican war but must know minor details like how andrew jackson shut down banks really disorganized so boring better to just take online made a history lover like myself loathe history
8067,Beryl  Kalisa,boring all we do is read from the book study guides are provided however notes and pages are very long and sometimes things appear on test that on study guide very disorganized and very boring class also if she like you you will know she can be so harsh to kids leaving or late
8068,Beryl  Kalisa,i was disappointed she is very sweet but the quality of her teaching leaves much to be desired her lectures were boring and monotonous rife with historical and geographical errors yet she was critical and condescending to the students for not being more interested as though lost her motivation she could do better i made an a
8069,Beryl  Kalisa,she is the sweetest kindest woman and she really wants you to pass she is the only teacher i know that provides you with study guides awesome
8070,Beryl  Kalisa,first off this teacher is very sweet and you will pass the class if you show effort she cares to help you and thats what i love about her i got a b in her class but i only recommend to take her if you dont mind reading out the book to study she does not provide any notes for you to study and her lectures tend to be boring good luck
8071,Beryl  Kalisa,this teacher i must say was confusing the studyguide had question that on the test she loves her job but always off topic overall i would rate her average cause she will help you pass if you show effort
8072,Beryl  Kalisa,great class great lectures if you follow the notes she gives read the pages she tells you to read and listen and participate in class you fail show no interest be disrespectful in any way and you will pay you have to totally not care to fail this class
8073,Beryl  Kalisa,i got an a in this class but it easy this is coming from a student that is usually tolerant of bad teachers but please take her history should not have been this hard always late disorganized and somewhat confusing very sweet lady but just do yourself and choose a different professor
8074,Beryl  Kalisa,let me just say nice but if you took her better off taking the class online she often goes off subject she keep a straight thought tests are questions over chapters and not sure what will be on the test the paper was easy just make sure you read her slideshows are useless she know how to work them
8075,Beryl  Kalisa,if you sleep in class dont participate in class like to like to leave early please do yourself a favor and dont take her class but she is great
8076,Gale L.  Jones-Hardimon,i like her she made everybody felt free in her class recommend everybody to take her i took her three semester ago and not sure if still teaching
8077,Gale L.  Jones-Hardimon,i like her and the class a best sociology class and easy to get
8078,Gale L.  Jones-Hardimon,nice funny good
8079,Gale L.  Jones-Hardimon,gale joneshardimon is the best teacher i have ever had she is fun and makes sociology interesting she gives you the desire to learn group tests that she gives the answers to in advance
8080,Gale L.  Jones-Hardimon,she is a wonderful and interesting teacher she is pretty fast paced with the reading but her class is all based on group work even you final is taken with your group
8081,Gale L.  Jones-Hardimon,she is very easy she creates a strees free environment for her students she does a alot of group activites that ae easy for example group tests final and presentation you will leasrn alot from her class and be able to get an a
8082,Ed  Bosworth,dr bosworth is a very kind brilliant man the definitions killed on the quizzes and final but he does grade very generously my advice is to go over previous class assignments and dedicate a couple hours a week to go over the notes and really memorize the material
8083,Ed  Bosworth,sorry but bosworth is a horrible teacher this is my second time taking computer organization and again the whole class is failing do not buy the book because he teaches directly from his slides his tests are unorganized and he hates answering questions try to find another study buddy that can help you because he really wont offer much help
8084,Ed  Bosworth,an awful teacher everyone i know is failing his class his lectures are not only brutally boring but useless as well he created a study guide that was absolutely useless and the majority of the class failed the test
8085,Ed  Bosworth,i took this class during the summer and hardly attended class the class was very boring but all assignments were online i really learn anything but really sweet
8086,Ed  Bosworth,unfortunately you have to take this class for this major so sorry i was lost the whole time
8087,Ed  Bosworth,this is the worst teacher i have ever had he does not explain anything and he does not even care about the stuff he teaches himself try to avoid him but if you must take him expect to be bored out of your ever liveing mind
8088,Ed  Bosworth,dear god this class is horrible so sorry you all have to take it as cpsc majors tests have random things that he may or may not discuss on them you only have grading opportunities lectures are boring and too fast paced to take notes helpful at all if you have a problem read his study notes even buy the book
8089,Ed  Bosworth,i am miserable he have any idea about what is going on so we definitely he has worn the same outfit every class he will bore you and confuse you do not waste your time p.s everybody faied the midterm
8090,Ed  Bosworth,boaring he never really answered any questions i had just do the online assignments on time if people stop showing up he starts giving random quizes to take attenance tests are toatlly off topic and not in the format he says they are no study guide shouldnt be a problem class if your in college you already know how to use the software anyways
8091,Ed  Bosworth,most boring professor i have ever had he complains too much his voice is extremely monotone i never knew when assignments were due if you pay attention which is extremely hard do well on the i had to force myself to go to class do not recommend
8092,Ed  Bosworth,never graded homework midterm took a month to get back most of the questions for the final did not come from his notes lectures or the textbook took hours of online research for each question highly recommend
8093,Ed  Bosworth,if you want a clear teacher go somewhere else the first thing he asks people in the class is if they have a learning disability not taking credit for his lack of a teaching ability or vagueness on what we are going to do i never had a class that basically is guess what the test will be on no examples whatsoever but if all the class fails oh well
8094,Ed  Bosworth,he gets bored with his own lectures and dismisses class early you only need the access code really no point in buying the book since you can get the code separately he tries to tell jokes i think he realizes laughing at him not with him but whatever overall easy class to pass worth putting up with strangeness
8095,Ed  Bosworth,he is a very boring professor in the way that he teaches he thinks he is very funny while at times he very well may be made us by our coursebook and we did not use it one time not even out of class to pass you really have to read over the notes on his site if you read the notes everyday you will pass quizzes are weekly mostly a monday
8096,Ed  Bosworth,dr bosworth is a great professor and a friendly person he is helpful and will make time for anyone if you have questions he knows his stuff which is always a plus he is fair teacher who can sometimes get offtopic but he keeps you on your toes and often has very interesting stories to tell i would highly recommend him
8097,Ed  Bosworth,i have had dr bosworth for classes now this professor has a great personality and really enjoys interacting with the students his website is full of useful material to help ace test overall assignments are easy but do require effort
8098,Ed  Bosworth,no comments
8099,Ed  Bosworth,dr bosworth cares about his students he has a good sense of humor he goes over everything that appears on a test you must apply yourself by at least reading his notes and looking at old homework and tests posted on his website
8100,Ed  Bosworth,as a person he was a nice guy but he did not know how to present his material he knew his stuff but he didnt know how to present it to the class other than that he is very funny good advice he has alot of his answers on his homework and exams on his website so go there and print it off
8101,Ed  Bosworth,grading can be a little tough he never shows you how to do the same thing the same way two times in a row which can lead to some confusion writes things on the board that testable looses you as you try to decipher what written down
8102,F.S.J.  Ledgister,thought i going to pass but if you ask questions about the papers assigned to you go to class do well on the quizzes and papers then be fine
8103,F.S.J.  Ledgister,i enjoyed his teaching
8104,F.S.J.  Ledgister,i thought this would be a scary course but he made it really clear
8105,F.S.J.  Ledgister,dude is huge and i mean huge and is a rude guy but he knows alot about politics
8106,F.S.J.  Ledgister,i learned a lot about foreign countries
8107,F.S.J.  Ledgister,i think this would be an exciting course but i learned a lot not an easy grader but you learn in his class take him again
8108,F.S.J.  Ledgister,he really knows a lot about political theory i thought this was going to be a booring course but made it really interesting
8109,F.S.J.  Ledgister,i think forgotten more than ever learn in political theory where does he get his memory
8110,F.S.J.  Ledgister,very knpowledgeable of politcal science a very fast speaker laughs at his own jokes even if no one else gets it
8111,F.S.J.  Ledgister,i think he knows too much you have to work hard for him
8112,F.S.J.  Ledgister,a lot of work but very good take him
8113,F.S.J.  Ledgister,brilliant teacher will make you either love political science or appreciate it more than before

8118,F.S.J.  Ledgister,a bright engaging teacher
8119,Lana  Carnes,i would highly recommend taking dr carnes and getting on her good side she favorites students but if you participate in class and make an effort do fine tests hard make sure you study the study guide and you will be fine her personality makes class enjoyable and a fun learning environment
8120,Lana  Carnes,avoid this teacher even though her syllabus says no quizzes she does them and puts them down as assignments on blackboard if your on her good side you might pass but if you are on her bad side you might have to drop the class being late or unable to attend class an option lots of reading never satisfied with your work
8121,Lana  Carnes,overall the best i can say is i hate dr carnes she liked me which is a good thing because her grading choices are incfluenced by her opinion also the current department chair so it is essential to get into her good favor
8122,Lana  Carnes,i really enjoyed dr carnes class the class discussions were always interesting it was my favorite class of the semester tests are easy do the study guide and pass i always made flashcards you have to do a few article summaries as well as a end of the term project procrastinate and sign up for the of the semester
8123,Lana  Carnes,great professor class is really discussion based so if that is not your cup of tea take her if you go to her office she will give you help with anything also study guides are exactly like the test do them and you will at least get a b on the test
8124,Lana  Carnes,very nice professor learn a lot in the classes almost all information from the book extremely organized loved her
8125,Lana  Carnes,tests are tough huge project good class that you will learn alot by taking
8126,Lana  Carnes,stay as far away as possible if on her good side fine but if she like you better to withdraw early she lets her feelings about students she like influence her grading also her instructions for papers are extremely vague and if you miss some small requirement she will penalize heavily
8127,Lana  Carnes,i took this class because it was suposed to be a fun class and you would learn alot about international business dr carnes made it not fun all you do in that class is read the text books and talk about it she will put you down if you get the answer wrong her tests are hard i was very disapointed with the class
8128,Lana  Carnes,lana carnes is rude and is now over the marketing department if you have any problems with your teachers go straight to the dean and bypass her she is unhelpful and judgemental she will also take the side of her teachers even if you provide evidence of grade discrimination
8129,Lana  Carnes,i thought dr class was okay although i would not take her again the assignments appear easy at first but then surprised when you get a bad grade no feedback whatsoever given no comments on papers or grades on blackboard plays favorites and expects attendance every class absolutely no slack given
8130,Lana  Carnes,dr carnes cct class is hard that is all that can be said i am an a and b student and it was really tough to pull out a b by talking to her you would think she built the entire college with her bare hands she also bad mouths other professors in the college of business which i thought was terrible to do in the classroom do not take her
8131,Lana  Carnes,dr carnes was scary at first but i grew to like the class until the day she started kicking people out of the classroom i missed one day and she got extremely upset you definitely have to attend every single day and be prepared to take grammar quizzes everyday as well not a piece of cake class that it should be
8132,Lana  Carnes,dr carnes seemed a little scary at first but i learned to like her and she worked her way into becoming one of my favorite teachers at eku her short report helps set the stage for the field report and both are pretty simple if you follow directions i was able to achieve a on the field report presentations bad just nervewracking
8133,Lana  Carnes,i took dr carnes for orientation and it was easy she made us go to campus events but it just helped us realize what all went on at eku she made me excited to take more business classes in the next years
8134,Lana  Carnes,dr carnes was not my favorite she expected waay too much work for a hr class she is not very helpful avoid taking her at all costs
8135,Lana  Carnes,not a bad class the field report took a lot of time but the in class assignments helped prepare for it each exam covers half the semester do the assignments well and turn in on time and you should be gravy also the group presentation is a little nerve racking but not horrible
8136,Lana  Carnes,good teacher you learn lots of info in class but she grades to hard on
8137,Lana  Carnes,i took her for orientation which never taught before we had a ton of requirements at campus events and i had to miss another class for one also she only teaches to business students she really worry about anyone else so if you a business major it kinda sucks
8138,Lana  Carnes,class is not too hard but carnes expects you to do the work and be prepared for class no excuses
8139,Hashim  Gibrill,dr gibrill is so down to earth he funny and very smart always glad to help plus british which is always cool in my opinion
8140,Hashim  Gibrill,awesome professor was extremely knowledgeable about the subject and made it crystal clear ans more importantly relevant
8141,Hashim  Gibrill,i had to do a lot of work but it paid off
8142,Hashim  Gibrill,he is knowledgable patient and funny take this class
8143,Hashim  Gibrill,one word cool
8144,Hashim  Gibrill,great
8145,Abi  Awomolo,i missed no more then classes but i missed no assignments i finished with an a she has you do tedious work like an essay every week but a fairly easy class
8146,Abi  Awomolo,great professor
8147,Abi  Awomolo,i enjoyed taking her class she made everything clear and was very helpful
8148,Abi  Awomolo,she makes american government seem very clear
8149,Abi  Awomolo,no comments
8150,Abi  Awomolo,i passed all the test with as n bs gave a very good presentation she loved answered the questions in class discussions that no one else knew the answer to and she gave me a b that is unacceptable for a major class
8151,Abi  Awomolo,she a good teacher she just talk funny but overall her methods are effective she can make it a bit more challenging though
8152,Abi  Awomolo,no comments
8153,Abi  Awomolo,i really learned american government
8154,Abi  Awomolo,very helpful in order to succeed in her class you must read the material thoroughly in order to actively participate in class and do well on tests if you have a penchant for reading long chapters and being detail oriented all the time you might not do well in her class
8155,Abi  Awomolo,she is hard to understand due to accent why is an african teaching american government
8156,Abi  Awomolo,no comments
8157,Abi  Awomolo,a wonderful teacher
8158,Beth  Todd,this is the easiest class an me major will take and dr todd makes it a lot of fun you really have to try to not get an
8159,Beth  Todd,pretty sure given an just for registering this class requires no effort so ever but then again i realky learn much easy a
8160,Beth  Todd,super helpful i have never worked on a lawnmower before but she was very understanding in the lawnmower lab and was quick to answer any questions we had go to class not hard and an easy a if you just show up lectures were usually really short
8161,Beth  Todd,dr todd is very helpful and nice me is a very easy class so easy that basically if you show up to class then you will pass there are in class assignments everyday so it is important to show up the only work really outside of class is the minute homeworks on blackboard and the two professional society meetings for credit
8162,Beth  Todd,for this class your homework consists of writing a paragraph about some type of engineering based topic if you show up you are pretty much guaranteed to pass the hardest part of this course is attending two engineering society meetings which is a nobrainer you also get to take apart a lawnmower nothings more fun than that
8163,Beth  Todd,easy class material is interesting and easy were very helpful and friendly dr todd was mean though asked a question outside of class and she was very condescending and rude very discouraging since i had always heard great reviews of her
8164,Beth  Todd,very nice and friendly class is easy mostly participation first few classes are in a classroom the rest are in a lab for lab we get in groups and assemble and disassemble a lawnmower including the engine and describe the parts i know anything about engines beforehand so i was a bit lost but after i looked it up online i got it
8165,Beth  Todd,very nice person and good professor extremely helpful both inside the classroom and as a counselor and she made me very interesting and fun and a great representation of me we took a lawn mower completely apart and put it back together as our semester project explaining how it worked along the way great take her if you can
8166,Beth  Todd,great teacher very understanding and goes out of her way to help you take her
8167,Beth  Todd,great teacher she is very understandable love the class so many cute guys anyways she helps you out whenever you need it you get to work with partners taking some of the weight off your shoulders highly recommended teacher
8168,Beth  Todd,really easy and gives tons of extra credit throughout the semester her projects are fun and entertaining a little arrogant but who isnt she has a slightly nasal voice but easy enough to understand her slightly difficult but with a little work they can be aced
8169,Beth  Todd,this class was extremely easy if you do the work this class should be an automatic a in addition dr todd is great about letting you know about scholarships and other opportunities definitely stay on her good side
8170,Beth  Todd,easy teacher but sometimes slow in getting grades back to you
8171,Beth  Todd,having our text books seemed pointless after awhile but our projects and classwork was always easy and interesting an easy a and an awesome teacher i love dr todd
8172,Beth  Todd,after the first few weeks there really any point in having the book
8173,Beth  Todd,good teacher easy grader
8174,Michael  Devine,michael is an amazing prof he definitely picks favourites and his acting class if physically challenging but if you take the work seriously he will respect you for it overall a fantastic theatre teacher
8175,Michael  Devine,one of the better profs at acadia
8176,Michael  Devine,i am a feminist

8178,Michael  Devine,while devine is indeed engaging and knowledgeable he also plays blatant favorites and strives to have students like him want in his he dumbs down material to appeal to everyone to the point where bad students are glorified and good students learn nothing also vaguley sadistic
8179,Michael  Devine,he is a great professor if you are one of his favourites he will also dumb down his classes until they are all discussions that do not require reading the text book the classes end up being a waste of time i would choose not to attend but it is mandatory
8180,Michael  Devine,great prof who can be an ass but is good none the less i really enjoy my time working with him
8181,Michael  Devine,no comments
8182,Michael  Devine,an amazing prof supportive and helpful extremely challenging but he does it in a way that you actually want to work hard and make him proud of you excellent guy
8183,Michael  Devine,best teacher i have ever had scary at first but then you get used to him and great understanding if you go and talk to him as well but a pushover i recommend his class as the only class that ever found interesting enough to go to
8184,Michael  Devine,such an amazing prof this class is most definatly my favourite he really has a way of putting his students at ease from day one classes are challenging but in a really amazing and fun way and wriggling like a cod is always a blast haha

8186,Elizabeth  Salter,i had been taking notes in lecture and out of the book studied prior to the midterm and the questions were nothing like i had expected luckily the group project and final bumped my grade she let the class vote on the final we chose an essay she told us the prompt beforehand felt that my grade did not reflect my effort or knowledge of subject
8187,Elizabeth  Salter,an interesting class for sure basically forensic anthropology but very difficult you have to write two page papers and there are three testsquizzes that are only questions long and very detail oriented and difficult you must study for these also come to class because you get a grade for showing up and that helps
8188,Elizabeth  Salter,i liked her long lectures but posted the class notes to elearning lots of subject related movie day classes two independent papers one group paper which i did alone member dropped class other do any work so dr salter told me to do it on my own test hard is essay written in class given in advance
8189,Elizabeth  Salter,there is a huge group paper and lots of long lectures there were plenty of class related movie days the real problem i had with the class was the actual grading it seem standard at all more like it depended on what mood she was in this is kind of teacher to not round up your grade been warned
8190,Elizabeth  Salter,she is very passionate about what she teaches which is admirable rarely gets through the entire lectures but is nice enough to post all of them online the papers and tests are really hard but she grades the papers easily the class is definitely not a blow off but it is not impossible to get an a you also watch a ton of movies
8191,Elizabeth  Salter,attendance is mandatory there is a sign in sheet at the beginning of class so be too late kinda boring alot of pp slides quizzes are not bad just study all the slides bc you know what gonna ask papers too bad follow rubric and you will do well movies are interesting at the end of the semester read great books too
8192,Elizabeth  Salter,this class was pretty boring and hard to do because it was a subject i found very interesting some days were more interesting but overall it got pretty mind numbing at least slides of notes most days tons of writing the page paper was hard not just long but nothing to write about i love or hate this class
8193,Elizabeth  Salter,just be sure to pay attention and actually study for the tests the class will be pretty easy fret over the page essays because get a good grade as long as you include all that she asks for in the rubric nothing too difficult a great professor knowledgeable very nice pretty funny
8194,Elizabeth  Salter,she is a really nice professor and most lectures are pretty intersting i took female biology and bones bodies and disease for bbd she tells you to read an emily craig book but its awaste of time there is only one question in the test about it and i got it wrong any ways you have to write ten page papers
8195,Elizabeth  Salter,tests were easy for someone with science background and study slides hard if you do not pay attention stickler on class etiquette you will get a good grade on the papers if you include everything she requires she gives you a rubic wants to be able to read the paper without trying to figure out what you are trying to say
8196,Elizabeth  Salter,if this was not my last semester i would have dropped this class from day awful lectures are dull slides are a mess tests do not match what she says to study for uses obscure things from the book never addressed during class if you can get around taking this class and this professor do so
8197,Elizabeth  Salter,she is a very nice professor as long as you have good classroom etiquette a lot of information is covered you must read and study well expectations are clear and she will help you if you asked there are two page papers the second one is create your own short mystery novel
8198,Elizabeth  Salter,this is the only class that i have ever dropped
8199,Elizabeth  Salter,class was interesting and she knew a lot about the subject the was very upbeat and tried to get the class to participate the papers were not hard and she gives you a rubric and went over the reqirements in class plenty of times i never had a hard time finding her in her office definitely not a blow off class so slackers beware
8200,Elizabeth  Salter,took this class during a week session because my advisor said it would be easy however there is a test page papers due on two novelsdue a week apart from eachother her tests are almost impossible to get an a on because all memorization of very presice facts recommend taking her in reg semester either
8201,Elizabeth  Salter,this class has probably been one of the worst i have taken since coming to utd unless you really like lectures that will put you to sleep and primates stay away she grades very hard and the lectures seemed very disorganized and unrelated to required readings
8202,Elizabeth  Salter,i took human female and bbd it was somewhat interesting and the information would probably be helpful to most there were three ten page research papers due in hf and in expects you to follow the rubrics very closely the tests are are challenging and consist of labeling fill in the blanks and multiple choice my best advice is to stud
8203,Elizabeth  Salter,her actual class was not bad we had interesting converstaions and lectures were interesting attendance is of your grade so if you plan on attending class thats a plus you have ten page papers in this class the rubric is not great she is impossible to get a hold of and if you do poorly she gives almost no feed back or reasoning
8204,Elizabeth  Salter,if you want to turn in a page paper every week then take her class her grading is very hard lectures were so boring so plan on getting a lap top to pass time she never looks at the students when she lectures just at the ceiling or at the wall behind us take her if you have a choice
8205,Elizabeth  Salter,excellent class good information for everyone to know the first class is hard but then the second half is easy with only two papers and she grades them easy as well so let failing your two tests lead u to drop the class because an a or b is attainable as long as you do the two papers
8206,John  Baker,dr baker really cares about his students the homework in this class was optional and there were tests and that may seem daunting but the tests were not difficult at all if you looked at the material did the homework this class could have been very hard but dr b went out of his way to make it easier for us while we still learned a lot
8207,John  Baker,this class is more of an informative class for your future in the aerospace program while learning about basic fundamentals dr baker cares a lot about everyone in the department and tries to assure everyone is set up for success in this class and in their future in the aem curriculum
8208,John  Baker,dr baker is a great professor aem was super easy compared to what heard about the other engineering intro courses
8209,John  Baker,dr baker is a nice person i did not like this class however due to being graded by few things some of which these things were out of the control for instance the egg drop or glider project either worked or it work and your grade depended on it we know our egg was going to break and our grade suffered no tests
8210,John  Baker,amazing class entertaining and knowledgeable plus more than willing to accommodate changes in schedule show up and have to try to fail
8211,John  Baker,great guy great class incredibly nice and willing to work with students show up for and practically guaranteed to pass
8212,John  Baker,great guy great class the schedule said this class met times a week but he made it to only twice a week baker made class enjoyable even though it was a definitely an easy a
8213,John  Baker,dr baker is very helpful and intelligent and definitely one of the best professors ever had
8214,John  Baker,great teacher he cares so much about his students you can tell he has a true passion for aerospace and mechanics the tests are extremely easy they take about minutes to finish he assigns group projects every month attend class
8215,John  Baker,dr baker is by far the best instructor that i have ever had he is very friendly and he legitimately cares for his students he helped us with the transition into the aem program and he is absolutely amazing the midterm and final are both multiple choice which take minutes each attendance is of your grade so show up for class
8216,John  Baker,dr baker is one of the best professors at alabama the class is extremely easy and more for getting you transitioned into the aerospace program dr baker is always available to help and genuinely cares about you
8217,John  Baker,dr baker is there to inspire you he teaches you about introductory aerospace engineering but what he really wants to do is to inspire you to succeed in life he really does this well and he enjoys what he does always willing to help even with his busy schedule as department head attendance is of the class so if you show up you pass
8218,John  Baker,excellent
8219,John  Baker,hands down one of the best professors i have ever had has a true passion for teaching and explains everything very well so that anybody could understand the material very willing to help you with class even if he does not teach it i wish all professors could teach as well as him
8220,John  Baker,definitely one of the best teachers at the university he is extremely helpful and an all around great guy he actually knows what he is talking about
8221,John  Baker,dr baker is one of the best teachers i have had he seems interested in what he is teaching and makes it interesting to learn he is one of the best at leading and encouraging participation in class discussions.i think it would be possible to take a class with him without learning something and enjoying learning it
8222,John  Baker,the guy to take for either one of the thermo classes easy to understand very helpful outside class my favorite professo at ua so far
8223,John  Baker,easy to understand
8224,John  Baker,made the class more reasonable than i expected it to be notes got repetative from the middle of the semester on so you actually have to pay attention to pick out new always willing to help
8225,John  Baker,turned out to be an easy class i took it because i had to not because i wanted to very helpful teacher and very easy to learn from
8226,Clark  Midkiff,good prof and a funny guy his lectures can run a bit long but his sense of humor and tangents keeps them interesting of what you do in class translates exactly to the tests he also makes accommodations for the way the online hw works so getting the grade there too hard just makes sure you underestimate his tests and do well
8227,Clark  Midkiff,midkiff is a really nice guy and make the class unnecessarily hard he goes off on tangents sometimes but they are related to the material and he has cool stories to tell make sure you study the lecture notes and examples for the tests
8228,Clark  Midkiff,great teacher doesnt make the class a living hell and the tests are very fair
8229,Clark  Midkiff,a great guy but its hard to learn thermo from him goes off on too many tangents figured out after the test that i could not go to class and still make the same grades im sure going to class helped a little more but just as fine studying old tests you get a note sheet every test tests with lowest dropped and a final
8230,Clark  Midkiff,he is the head of me department he has been teaching thermo for years his lectures can be dull and put you to sleep he goes off topic a lot with his stories homework is not due till end of semester but keep up to do well on tests the redeeming value is his tests are easy and curves very generously
8231,Clark  Midkiff,good guy just kind of has dull lectures worth going to class though when attendance drops he will announce a pop quiz your question will usually be please recall your name and you turn in your name very lenient with homework as well
8232,Clark  Midkiff,rambles a lot he takes up half of the class going on his midkiff diversions paying money to get an education not listen to stories his inclass examples are nothing like the test questions and the homework problems are unnecessarily hard if you get above a he counts them as a because the program messes up the book sucks too
8233,Clark  Midkiff,i loved midkiff as a person he was hilarious and told awesome stories a lot but sometimes his lectures were boring or there were things on the exams that we ever go over all of the homework is due at the end of the semester but keep up with it because it helps on the exams most of the homework was way harder than the exams though
8234,Clark  Midkiff,pretty easy class a lot of the mathbased problems are just plug and chug be careful with the conceptual stuff look at the notes he puts online pay attention in class do the homework and be just fine
8235,Clark  Midkiff,dr midkiff is one of the most liked and respected professors in the me department he regularly assigns homework dealing directly with the material that will be on the test and devotes almost the entire class to working example problems so that you can actually figure them out on your own his lectures are useful and he has a good sense of humor
8236,Clark  Midkiff,dr midkiff is a really knowledgeable and helpful teacher he is always available for help and responds quickly to emails usually copying the whole class so that no one is confused he gives a few attendance quizzes if he starts to see a decrease in attendance overall very respected and really knows his stuff would definitely recommend
8237,Clark  Midkiff,dr midkiff is a phenomenal teacher and a really nice person considering how difficult thermodynamics is he makes it very understandable he includes tons of practical application examples in his lectures that make them engaging great sense of humor too i highly suggest him for any thermo course at this school
8238,Clark  Midkiff,his handson experience in industry helps him to be able to explain course topics in a way which is easy to understand
8239,Clark  Midkiff,midkiff is awesome he is very easy to understand and he puts all his notes online he is also easy to talk to and very understanding if you need help
8240,Clark  Midkiff,dr midkiff is the man all notes are posted online he is very helpful and his exams are more than fair a lot of homework though
8241,Clark  Midkiff,very reasonable professor he made the class enjoyable would find a way to relate material to real world application
8242,Clark  Midkiff,very knowledgeable hw from the textbook doesnt really help with preparing for tests getting the solutions manual will really help several of our problems couldnt be solved or had errors in the solution he made a lot of mistakes working problems in class which made it easy to get confused his multiple choice are pretty tough overall great guy
8243,Clark  Midkiff,test were straight forward go to class do the homework and you will do well also class notes were posted online
8244,Clark  Midkiff,very nice guy gave a whole sheet of paper front and back for use on test gave tests which was good and bad the class made absolutely no sense but thats not the professors fault just use the peice of paper on the test and youll be fine maybe
8245,Clark  Midkiff,great guy great class fun lectures and he emails all notes which is super helpful for tests may give a super easy quizzes q who are we playing this weekend a georgia for a homework grade but if not there get a zero so go to class making one really good review sheet is clutch for the final
8246,Keith  Williams,i tried liking him i really did i really wanted to this class was awful it was the same content as section but he managed to drive it into the ground and not teach anything whatsoever for the love of all that is well in the world do not take this man for dynamic systems mahmoodi will not actively try to ruin your life
8247,Keith  Williams,professor williams give fair tests but requires a lot out of his students computer assignments mandatory grade of or higher to pass take very long to complete hours and are only worth of the final grade lectures can often be off topic and hard to follow as he moves fast with preparation and studying this class can be an a however
8248,Keith  Williams,he is a great teacher and really the material this class has the potential to be difficult but he did his best to make sure that everybody passes i look forward to taking him for future classes
8249,Keith  Williams,he is very nice and extremely helpful he really wants to everyone to do well though he only worked problems in class he spent much time after class explaining and going over questions his class did require a lot of work in the end an overall enjoyable class
8250,Keith  Williams,super nice guy class requires lots of work but he makes it as easy on you as possible
8251,Keith  Williams,no comments
8252,Keith  Williams,varries by the year my semester almost everyone got but he has been difficult in previous semesters very very nice kinda reminds us of dilbert
8253,Joey  Parker,extremely nice and follows the powerpoint well he explains material fairly well and is extremely helpful when you are confused he prepares you for the exams
8254,Joey  Parker,great teacher examples in class were very similar to questions asked on tests has homework due every class but not overly difficult come to class and do your homework and you should get an a
8255,Joey  Parker,dr parker is extremely reliable and he genuinely cares about his students and will put your priorities in front of his own he referred to excel as a stupid computer program just about every class which surprisingly got more and more hilarious with time
8256,Joey  Parker,class itself is easy but when it came to actually taking the tests i feel like we were prepared enough for the questions asked however he is a really fair grader and will give you the benefit of the doubt so if on the right track get most of the points
8257,Joey  Parker,dynamics can be hard but j parker is definitely the guy to take his test problems are so much better than he grades easy too do your hw and you will be fine
8258,Joey  Parker,extremely boring and condescending but class is not that hard
8259,Joey  Parker,dr parker is the guy to have for dynamics he is a very good teacher and the tests that hard on the tests if you are on the right track then he will give you most of the points the only bad thing is the homework you can expect new homework every class
8260,Joey  Parker,tests that hard but the lab reports are pretty rough very fair grades are pretty good
8261,Anwarul  Haque,homework due before every class but only questions i would do the homework and not chegg it because help when preparing for the tests tests are similar to homework problems and the final was exactly our homework problems
8262,Anwarul  Haque,statics with haque was very difficult he did examples during class and assigned homework every night even if we finish the examples in class sometimes the homework and class notes seemed completely unrelated tests are of your grade and he curve
8263,Anwarul  Haque,key points mostly vectors and vector applications all tests were easy for anyone with a clear understanding of cal final was extremely hard magical curves i went into the final needing to make a to make a solid b i did terrible on the final ended with an a great teacher short homework due every lecture
8264,Anwarul  Haque,a little difficult to understand but i took this class at he focused more on computation than conceptual questions but does a great job at explaining both
8265,Anwarul  Haque,not a great lecturer just does a few examples with little context or general formulas tests are moderately difficult and he is very stingy with partial credit no dropping grades or anything like that homework is very time consuming and small errors hurt your grade would not recommend if you very good at physics
8266,Anwarul  Haque,so im still in his class right now but i wanted to write a review for people looking to take haque the beginning weeks of his class are very easy but dont be fooled the information picks up i would say go to his classes but his accent is very thick so its not very worth it if anything read the book
8267,Anwarul  Haque,very smart man not a very good communicator very good with explaining or understanding your questions
8268,Anwarul  Haque,not bad not especially good if cool with physics mechanics you got it if not not easy to get help the first weeks you can skip some classes later you learn things he checked attendance randomly times over the semester
8269,Anwarul  Haque,clear straightforward understandable teaches all necessary material well and prepares you for tests handwritten short homework daily i would suggest doing them for practice gives a couple tests but they are short and fair and he tells you what type of problems will be on them i would definitely recommend dr haque
8270,Anwarul  Haque,very good professor and really consider request test not hard but needs detailed reviews
8271,Anwarul  Haque,haque is an exceptional professor his communication is shaky at times but get used to it test questions are very similar to the homework he gives a couple good examples in lecture but usually gets rushed toward the end of class if you pay attention in class and do the homework not too bad
8272,Anwarul  Haque,gives good examples the test questions were either examples from the book or problems from the back of the book taught slightly different methods from what the book said if you go to class pay attention and take good notes easy to get a good grade
8273,Anwarul  Haque,tests really covered what he lectured and homework assigned great instruction and very willing to help
8274,Anwarul  Haque,great professor teaches well answers questions easy going with his students a nice guy and great examples
8275,Anwarul  Haque,excellent teacher knows his subject
8276,Anwarul  Haque,he really wants all his students to do well and as a result he often curves grades or gives bonus points he is hard to understand at first but if you sit near the front and pay attention you get used to him
8277,Anwarul  Haque,i like this guy because he seems to be helpful and friendly he try to act too smart like all the other egocentric proffesors seems to value your overall experience he gave us a take home final
8278,Muhammad  Sharif,not the best in lecture be sure to pay attention during his review classes before exams as they always give the exact problem types that will be on exams typically curves the overall grade at the end of the semester as most students do poorly
8279,Muhammad  Sharif,do not take sharif for dynamics or anything for that matter he stands up at the front working examples with horrible handwriting and speaks incomprehensibly to make it worse he uses online tests and quizzes with ridiculously low tolerances and made us write down work but give partial credit for it would just take off points
8280,Muhammad  Sharif,i listen when i was told not to take sharif for dynamics and i wish i taken his class the material difficult but he only uses online grading and it makes it really hard to do well in the class even if you understand the material he also has a really thick accent and bad handwriting lectures are difficult to understand
8281,Muhammad  Sharif,the class consists of him standing at the front working out examples he never explains what he is doing or why and it is super confusing combine this with a large lecture hall his horrible handwriting thick accent and the lecture is incomprehensible the grade you receive is based on online pop quizzes online test during lecture period
8282,Muhammad  Sharif,his lectures are not very helpful with his poor handwriting and angry demeanor he was not very helpful during office hours he posts online notes that are typed and easier to follow along he does offer good review before each tests to give an idea of what will be on tests lots of homework but only worth of grade
8283,Muhammad  Sharif,professor sharif is unintelligible his accent is atrocious and he speaks as though he has a mouth full of marbles and his handwriting is somehow worse he writes both his and as you would a gamma which come up a lot in dynamics he capable of doing his own problems in class and made the test the day after the drop date
8284,Muhammad  Sharif,professor sharif teaches fluids in a very straightforward way he holds review sessions before exams that are very similar to the exam itself homework is due every class but is only worth of the final grade so hurt too much if you forget a few assignments if you study the review and homework problems before the tests you should be fine
8285,Muhammad  Sharif,i cannot understand what he is saying his notes are very messy and his handwriting is horrible his tests are similar to the homework but he is not good at explaining anything i had him for fluids and dynamics and both times were miserable do not take him for anything
8286,Muhammad  Sharif,dr sharif comes to class with problems to work out these problems are almost identical to the online homework however he often makes confused with his own work this can make the class confusing his tests are very similar to the homework make sure you actually know how to do the homework and not just copy it from your notes
8287,Muhammad  Sharif,do not take for dynamics
8288,Muhammad  Sharif,take him if you plan on taking dynamics he is supposed to be pretty good with fluid mechanics but he very comfortable teaching dynamics
8289,Muhammad  Sharif,his accent is difficult to understand and not helped by his incredible messy handwriting have to teach yourself the material out of the book also very condescending to anyone who asks a question he gives a lot of homework but not too tricky his tests are almost always just like his review questions which is nice
8290,Muhammad  Sharif,i find dr sharif very difficult to understand his accent is thick his handwriting is messy and his lecture notes are unorganizated a lecturer that works examples without telling you what your solving for what topic on etc he also wastes a lot of class time waiting for the class to participate when no one knows the answer
8291,Muhammad  Sharif,professor sharif is not the professor to take dynamics with we spend class going over future homework examples while this may seem nice our homework did not relate to the first exam also when a student asks him a question in class he simply repeats what he has said before which is not helpful i would not recommend him for dynamics
8292,Muhammad  Sharif,sharif was a great choice for fluids he was very clear in grading criteria explained things very well and kept the class moving at a good pace i took the class during the second summer term but even though the class only lasted about a month the work required to do well in the class was very manageable i would recommend taking sharif
8293,Muhammad  Sharif,the accent is the worst part very hard to understand but the class overall is easy to pass with little effort attendance mandatory but homework is due every class he reviews the class before the test and a great indication of what to expect on the tests his tests are multiple choice and easy to do well on textbook used for hw
8294,Muhammad  Sharif,not a great teacher and the accent help but lets you know what to expect on exams and the final the one to take for fluids attendance mandatory but you have to go in order to turn in hw of your grade due every lecture
8295,Muhammad  Sharif,just a great great guy makes an impossible class extremely bearable and not too difficult all whilst making sure you learn the basic concepts of fluid mechanics hilarious helpful and just a great professor all around
8296,Muhammad  Sharif,i enjoyed sharif as he was great at communicating explains hard conceptsproofs for those who are more interested but require too much on tests i highly recommend going to lecture and taking good notes and trying out the hw hw is good practice for tests but is small part of grade gives good reviews for tests and allows formula sheets
8297,Muhammad  Sharif,i loved this class dr sharif has an accent which takes a few days to get used to but he has an amazing teaching style the majority of lecture is him working out problems by hand before each test he does a review of questions which are extremely similar to the actual test questions he gives tons of partial credit and always wants to help
8298,Mary  McHugh,mchugh is the best professor i have had at merrimack she is very passionate and respects view had her twice and wish i could take her class again
8299,Mary  McHugh,a really great professor her lectures are fun and she really wants to hear her students opinions in class gives very minimum hw and is easy to maintain your grade if you just do what she gives you so active around campus and will be more than willing to help you in whatever you need
8300,Mary  McHugh,she is the best teacher on campus take as many of her classes as you can she really listens to the students and gives you a ton of chances to get extra credit
8301,Mary  McHugh,she is very nice
8302,Mary  McHugh,she is very nice and helpful but i feel like the material that she covers is very repetative and elementary
8303,Mary  McHugh,definately take a class that she teaches extremely nice and funny and she makes class interesting
8304,Mary  McHugh,take a class with mchugh at merrimack if at all possible she makes the class interesting and is very clear she is soo nice and really wants everyone to succeed very highly recommended
8305,Mary  McHugh,wonderful professor i enjoyed the class immensely very clear on assignments and her lectures were always interesting
8306,Mary  McHugh,she is great so funny she tells jokes all the time she is really into what she teachs and makes it as interesting as congress can be real simulation at the end on the term is wicked fun
8307,Mary  McHugh,lots of work but very very nice
8308,Mary  McHugh,some busy work but overall a great teacher she really lets you know what looking for on tests you really have to do much reading at all for the classes as long as you have pretty good attendance she has a pretty good sense of humor too which keeps it interesting definitely take another class with her
8309,Mary  McHugh,total babe great teacher she is very clear and easy to understand she has been known to be one hell of a softball player and take people out at the knees i have worked with her for several years now and have never had a better teacher i love her dc
8310,Mary  McHugh,washington jefferson adams lincoln adams

8313,Mary  McHugh,no comments
8314,Mary  McHugh,no comments
8315,Jon  McFarland,macfarland combines mind and heart he is very well read on many subjects although many people fail to understand his teaching style it works he shows you had to think through scripture with intensity of the mind and with the felt of your heart i know him well and consider him a friend
8316,Jon  McFarland,all his classes were cool yeah he is a little dry but he is very passionate about christ you see it through his teaching stop youngstas
8317,Jon  McFarland,the lectures were hard to follow but he is a great guy and knows his stuff have to worry about getting the paper in on the due date just get it in he understands the meaning of grace thank you jon
8318,Jon  McFarland,take his class just not too early in the morning good teacher and good content
8319,Jon  McFarland,i fall asleep every time but he is so nice and helpful i just feel bad because that class is boring soo boring and its like fifty million people in the class i hear his sermon on the mount is good im taking it this term
8320,Jon  McFarland,no comments

8322,Thomas  Hu,professor hu lectures in an understanding matter writes all the steps to the problem daily homework that is optional it is to your benefit to do the homework three quizzes per week and the problems are from the homework fair and easy grading system recommended to do the homework tells you what is on the test and is similar to the homework
8323,Thomas  Hu,no exaggeration when i say mr hu is one of the best teachers had calc3 is not easy and it covers many topics yet i was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what i learned in lecture engaging caring hilarious and approachable he makes himself available outside of class and is responsive to he is rooting for you
8324,Thomas  Hu,he will teach you outside the box and if you attend his class everyday and put some work i guarantee you will be ready for your next math class
8325,Thomas  Hu,took mr summer school course he was awesome explains everything in detail he is well organized and goes over things that way you definitely absorb the information i would take him again
8326,Thomas  Hu,he makes it clear on the first day what he expects from the class he grades by how well you do compared to the class he has a very thick accent and makes jokes about math majors and being from china you will hear the word lousy and stupid everyday he uses it to describe everything he goes super fast and you need to study outside of class
8327,Thomas  Hu,has a very thick accent but all his notes and examples he puts on the board are clear and straight forward very useful for math daily lectures help tremendously with the hw do the hw to help pass the quiz the next day quizzes are daily he will go over anything people have trouble with grades on a curve
8328,Thomas  Hu,great teacher in ccsf very funny and his logic is very clear this teacher really get you ready for math and math
8329,Thomas  Hu,mr hu is a great professor and can be quite humorous i took him for both math he takes attendance by use of daily quizzes and these will add up so come to class we did massive amounts of homework especially during the summer but it was always out of the book and not online his exams can be tough so prepare yourself by studying
8330,Thomas  Hu,mr hu would take time to explain the more subtle points of calculus i i was repeating this class for the third time with respectable grades previously mr hu would make jokes about stupid math majors and the sci fi show dr who mr hu had class study groups prior to i wish i had better study skills to retain learning i will review
8331,Thomas  Hu,mr hu is a very nice guy but also one of the most difficult math professors ever had i struggled to earn a c but hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures not recommended for the faint of heart but if you identify as a math geek and like a challenge then this is the guy for you
8332,Thomas  Hu,this dude moves super fast has a thick accent and has a grading scale which means its hard for you to improve your grade if not one of the smart people bad teacher hard to understand lucky that i was decent enough at math to pass
8333,Thomas  Hu,if you are bad at math just do not take his class at all he is a nice guy tries to be funny and joke around but as a professor he is just horrible he cannot speak english properly he knows math just cant explain it he does not like confrontation either if you talk to him about something he will take it personal and make your life hell
8334,Thomas  Hu,you will learn a lot from his class
8335,Thomas  Hu,helpful helpful helpful this is the guy you want if you are fearing math i was dreading math but hu tells you on day that he has study sessions saved my tail it mean easy college math not supposed to be but in the study sessions he works with you til you get it and very funny too he makes class enjoyable
8336,Thomas  Hu,this class was really difficult i found a lot of his lectures hard to comprehend because he really go in depth with step by step concise directions a nice guy but i think this class is better suited for someone that already knows a bit about statistics or is generally very good at math
8337,Thomas  Hu,one of the best math teachers he assigns homework but it is similar to what will be on the test he sets you up for success in his class he may have a thick accent but he writes everything on the board so you have no reason not to understand he made coming to class enjoyable with his sense of humor and funny personality
8338,Thomas  Hu,amazing teacher
8339,Thomas  Hu,i took prof hu summer he is a great teacher very willing to help gives tons of examples during the lecture he does have an accent but you get used to it very kind and nice teacher he gives tons of hw but how you learn math anyway quizes everyday were group were individual on test you can bring small note
8340,Thomas  Hu,i took prof hu summer he is a great teacher very willing to help gives tons of examples during the lecture he does have an accent but you get used to it very kind and nice teacher he gives tons of hw but how you learn math anyway quizes everyday were group were individual on test you can bring cheat sheet
8341,Thomas  Hu,fall night class.he speak cantonese mandarin english and post solutions online.his notes are organize.he check homework but give you value final grade from homework problems you could use a formula paper in exam.final exam is open book notes so print all solutions from his final review and at least read them once
8342,Marc  Stern,class consists solely of student presentations prof does not teach material provides only limited guidance of discussion expects a lot of prior knowledge of course material tests are very difficult papers graded with handwriting that is illegible so it is difficult to see what you did wrong and how to improve
8343,Marc  Stern,head of history department as with almost any elective at bentley he takes the classes too seriously and the tests are graded toughly that being said he does give you the list of terms and essay topics for the midterm and final a week in advance so that helps overall meh take again but a super nice guy who cares a lot
8344,Marc  Stern,i was not interested in history however professor stern was a really great teacher and kept your attention i will definitely take one of his classes again
8345,Marc  Stern,nice guy but a tough teacher all classes are straight lecture so be ready to take notes for tests he gives you terms and essays he picks a portion of them on test day i had to work hard for a and i have a solid background in apush take it only if very serious even then take with caution
8346,Marc  Stern,definitely knows his stuff but has seriously high expectations for students i like history lsm am studies and worked really hard went to office hours did the readings and simply get an a on anything he was not helpful when i asked him how to improve on future assignments hard exams and hard on take
8347,Marc  Stern,knows a lot about history and admits that most of what he knows is useless knowledge read and outline the textbook and be set for the exam if interested in history take advantage of his strict grading and higher expectations of students if you like history take his class
8348,Marc  Stern,said it well think failing the class the entire time however not hard to beat the exams this teacher is also incredibly knowledgeable uncanny he knows what talking about that said he can also tell if you bs but there many assignments to bs anyway you will remember a lot from this course as well
8349,Marc  Stern,about some aspects of us history lectures interesting friendly even tell if separating fact from dependency on notes of reading background in history is nearly necessary manner thought speech and writing
8350,Marc  Stern,very intense history class a lot of reading and a huge amount of material on each exam only take if you love history if your filling an elective probably better off in a different class
8351,Marc  Stern,stern is an amazing lecturer he seems to know everything about u.s history think failing his course the entire time but if you try hard and do the work do fine you end up learning a lot because of the essay format of the exams he gives a list of possible essays ahead of time great guy but expects a lot from students
8352,Marc  Stern,the guy is very very smart probably the smartest professor at the school when it comes to his subject matter wants you to really engage and understand the subject if your looking for an easy a like most people at bentley instead of learn pick another teacher who will teach you nothing you will look at the world differently after his course
8353,Marc  Stern,terrible teacher i expected better from the head of the department but every class he decides to display his knowledge about the topic and branch off to random topics after all that he expects you to know what he meant to talk about also a mean guy in general very inconsiderate when a student was very sick and needed to switch final time
8354,Marc  Stern,grades kinda hard but if you put in the work you can do well very nice guy but i might consider other professors for a history class
8355,Marc  Stern,it was horrible he is such a hard grader and he help you if you need him try not to take this class
8356,Marc  Stern,this class started off pretty well he seemed funny and at first seemed like he was going to be a great guy wrong i did everything i could to stay awake and study and do well but i still got an awful grade my friend was the smartest in the class and only got a so yea
8357,Marc  Stern,boring class grades kind of hard but if you put in the time you can do well in this class he knows what doing and is always willing to help
8358,Marc  Stern,dont take this profressor he just reads from the powerpoint and his tests are very hard
8359,Marc  Stern,this was so boring i could not help but fall asleep this is not an easy class and you will need to memorize everything
8360,Marc  Stern,this class was extremely boring even though he gives you everything that is on the midterm and final there is an insane amount of information to know most of the info terms you have to look up online because you were not able to find it in pages of notes and he will not help you at all
8361,Marc  Stern,so boring and all he does is lecutre testsstudy fifty will be on and you pick each expected to be a page in blue book essaystudy seven will be on you pick should be pages if you guess right be ok aside from extreme hand pain but he holds you accountable for insane amount of info
8362,Catherine  Welch,catherine was hard but good she knew her stuff and helped her students get jobs at good places i think all dissing her are just mad because she gave you a bad grade
8363,Catherine  Welch,no comments
8364,Catherine  Welch,no comments
8365,Catherine  Welch,always very helpful her wealth of realworld experience makes her a far cry from your typical jschool prof her casual approach can be offputting when compared with the rest of the faculty but no doubt that this was a great class
8366,Catherine  Welch,she is really badshe has no clue about and the school want to pay for a good radio teacher so she was the only one that would work for the little money they pay she sucks
8367,Catherine  Welch,she is still learning not good for the journalism school
8368,Paul  Pecorino,paul was a nice guy but he was a ridiculously hard grader he had no grace with any grades over the top and should not be teaching he is too smart to be teaching college kids if you dont talk in class you dont get any participation points i would never take him again im telling you save your self
8369,Paul  Pecorino,nice guys awful teacher just writes unintelligible graphs on the board and expects you to know what he is talking about even use the book at all only has tests and a quiz and a cumulative final this guy is way too smart to teach people who econ geniuses would take a different professor
8370,Paul  Pecorino,i am an international student dr pecorino is the most responsible professor i met in ua his class is easy to understand so that i rarely read textbook after class the class and homework is much helpful for tests he is a very kind person i really appreciate for his help
8371,Paul  Pecorino,definitely the hardest class taken at ua he makes up his own versions of the textbook graphs with about examples on the hw and study guide then he changes the graphs on tests in every possible way and be ready for him to take off points for your lines not being perfectly tangent and minor labeling errors would not recommend
8372,Paul  Pecorino,class is difficult and fast paced and homework are for extra credit but you pass if you go he lectures the entire class and there are homework assignments every week the tests are mostly from the study guides which are from the homework go to the review session and study and a manageable a
8373,Paul  Pecorino,paul is weird but funny his notes are everythinggo to class definitely do the homework get an answer key as well as the review sessions he basically gives you answers to the test he is definitely a tough grader but gives you everything you need to be successful also gives up to extra credit points for hmk participation
8374,Paul  Pecorino,not a bad choice for ec he has dry humor i made an a in his class and studied a day or two before the test not very smart either
8375,Paul  Pecorino,great guy a bit monotone though definitely recommend his class
8376,Paul  Pecorino,worst teacher at ua we pay too much for him to be a professor here
8377,Paul  Pecorino,by far worst ever had ua should fire him today i am a straight a student who got my first c because he was such a bad professor
8378,Paul  Pecorino,dr pecorino is incredibly smart no denying that however often times he forgets that he is teaching college students do the study guides and be fine for the tests go to lecture and make him explain the final however was awful i scored above a on every test and barely got a on the cumulative final of your grade
8379,Paul  Pecorino,by far the worst teacher at ua avoid
8380,Paul  Pecorino,avoid him no matter what care about his students in the slightest since a research professor will nickel and dime you on every test so much so that all semester i never received full credit on a single question changes study guide questions to be nothing like test questions horrible teacher all around even bother with xc
8381,Paul  Pecorino,dr pecorino is one of the most confusing professors i have ever taken i have never had to put in more hours studying for a class then his he will change every practice problem from the study guide on the test and confuse you to no end would definitely recommend taking any other econ class
8382,Paul  Pecorino,hardest undergrad class had in my ec major exams are really hard would probably be easier if he gave you the tools you need your studying tools are to examples of the question which he will change drastically you need to memorize the textbook his slides his lectures and google all the info he give you if you want an a avoid
8383,Paul  Pecorino,pecorino makes ec the hardest class at ua do not take him for this course half of the class dropped before halloween and the other half mostly has cs my advisor said this is possibly hardest class at ua taught by one of the worst teachers here do not take
8384,Paul  Pecorino,dr pecorino is one of the worst professors at ua i am a straight a student and i think he makes class as hard as he can i do not recommend his ec if you have another elective you can take
8385,Paul  Pecorino,fantastic professor easy to understand and always lets lecture out early never assigns homework or quizzes so all your grades come from tests such a great teacher that always prepared for the test
8386,Paul  Pecorino,there is a lot of extra credit and he is very fair in the grading criteria he is super sweet if you show up to every class you get four points on your final average would take him again
8387,Paul  Pecorino,dr pecorino is honestly a great professor his lectures are somewhat boring but economics the grading system is incredibly fair and dr pecorino offers very generous extra credit if you show up to every class he will give you points on your final grade you can get an easy a by just showing up to class and studying for exams
8388,Sandra  Hampel,best teacher ever made math understanding
8389,Sandra  Hampel,she is so sweet and understanding
8390,Sandra  Hampel,very helpful just hard to understand sometimes good teacher just over explains things sometimes drops the worst test grade and some homework and quizzes
8391,Sandra  Hampel,no comments
8392,Sandra  Hampel,i like this teacher she really wants her students to understand the math.she is extremely helpful i dislike math very much but she got me through it i was very bored most of the time however but that is not her fault just the math
8393,Sandra  Hampel,mrs hampel is a great teacher she definitely wants her students to do well in class she works hard each class to teach you the material by going through practice problems i recommend her
8394,Sandra  Hampel,i love mrs hampel she is very helpful and is willing to do anything for you she goes through the problems step by step and gives you easy ways to solve them she really wants all of her students to do well i definitely recommend her
8395,Sandra  Hampel,prof hampel is a great teacher she is fair helpful and knows her stuff if you show effort she will help you out as much as possible truly cares about students i recommend
8396,Sandra  Hampel,loved her very passionate about her students and wants you to do good she knows the material very well i highly recommend her
8397,Sandra  Hampel,i do well in the class but this was a wonderful teacher my grade was not a reflection on how well a teacher she is super nice much better than the other math teachers she knows her stuff i hope i get to take her again
8398,Sandra  Hampel,shes nice
8399,Sandra  Hampel,wonderful wom.an who wants to help everyone
8400,Sandra  Hampel,she tries her best to help everyone pass the class while still comprehending everything needed
8401,Sandra  Hampel,great teacher willing to help you out
8402,Doyoung  Lee,seems like a caring lady but her teaching methods are awful she except late work even with a note does not reply to emails and is difficult to speak to i constantly felt like i was being judged by her when i participated in class because she is very opinionated i have all as except this class stay away
8403,Doyoung  Lee,professor lee rants in class about her life when she does talk about the course reading she summarizes it sometimes inaccurately makes broad claims about it and introduces irrelevant ideas she expects students to agree with her for grades she tells students what her criteria is and says that she grades according to it but doesnt do so
8404,Doyoung  Lee,do not take any class this woman teaches all she does constantly is rant and talk about her life she makes students read a course reader she created and do outline off it but she even cover them in class or outright lies about the info sher grading for everything makes no sense and what she wants from you any better
8405,Doyoung  Lee,she opens your eyes to asian american women issues but make sure to do your outlines asap there is few hw and barely any quizzes so try to work hard on them midterm and final were essays a tough grader but you just need to understand and write in her pov visit her during office hours and sit in different parts of the classroom trust me
8406,Doyoung  Lee,she sometimes lectures but she likes to rant about politics most of the time her rubric and instructions for getting an a during an exam is very unclear since everyone in the class followed them and no one got anything above a b coming from a computer science student who gets and this is the first grade below b that getting
8407,Doyoung  Lee,do not take this professor she is not specific on anything she is not organized at all which causes you to be confused most of the time she is a tough grader and only wants you to believe what she believes thanks to her bad organization skills i now have four assignments due in one week as finals are approaching do not take her
8408,Doyoung  Lee,teacher was inconsistent about due dates which is a struggle with such a difficult essay heavy class we had three big projects due in one day a lot of group essays which suck be prepared to pull a lot of all nighters will hurt your gpa but the class is very interesting and nice about extra credit second chances and personal struggles
8409,Doyoung  Lee,the class was not useful at all the most important thing is that this professor is fake and do not respect the students take her class
8410,Doyoung  Lee,take this class if genuinely passionate about asian american history a lot of the people that like her really interested in the content very vague when it comes to assignments a midterm a final and some outside work but as long as you put that you deserve an a on the self evaluations get an a
8411,Doyoung  Lee,terrible confusing and not clear about what she wants she will change her mind every five seconds takes forever to grade homework and papers everything that she says is right so you better agree with her
8412,Doyoung  Lee,i express how much i disliked her and this entire course this course should have been driven through discussion and opions but seems too only care about her opinions she give too much work and grades way too harshly if you miss one small thing on notes alone you will fail that assignment do yourself a favor and avoid her at all cost
8413,Doyoung  Lee,this professor only lectures about why students should be good people and be classy come time for our midterm everyone asked what the test was going to be on because no material was covered or understandable in class there even enough time to take her midterm because she talked the majority of the time about her day never again
8414,Doyoung  Lee,professor lee stated from the first class that she is a strict professor however sometimes she is unclear with what she expects her discussions were interesting although sometimes irrelevant from the topic but the time go by faster her class is easy to pass if you do the work and ask questions when her instructions clear
8415,Doyoung  Lee,do it just so much reading she goes off topic not clear about anything remember due dates the midterm and final are essay exams late to office hours the subject is interesting but her class is no bueno
8416,Doyoung  Lee,simple do not take her she never replies to emails very snappy in group chat if you ask a question she also gives low grades on assignments and it is a requirement to watch movies in the library even though an online class she grades work late and gives a ton of work and only a class everyone in my class failed
8417,Doyoung  Lee,the worst professor ive ever had she isnt clear on her outlines she wants certain material on the outlines but gives you such a broad topic at office hours she will give you a lecture of what doing wrong but will not tell you how to better your work and off topic percent of the time she also treats you like grade school students
8418,Doyoung  Lee,i dont like history classes but i did like that she is very understanding and passionate for what she lectures students who take this course think that you need to know a lot about aas but this is a beginners course which she does remind us multiple times throughout the semester that she does not expect us to be experts on the subject
8419,Doyoung  Lee,online met about times throughout the semester you must attend and be there the whole class time or she will mark you down the book i highly used in the course all your assignments are assigned from the book was not clear with instructions groups were horrible new groups each week which she assigned final and midterm paper homework
8420,Doyoung  Lee,this class covers topics in detail and the professor is very helpful and knowledgeable participate get involved do the work and do well in the class professor is very understanding of students this is a level class expected to perform at a high standard she gives good feedback too just dedicate yourself and be fine
8421,Doyoung  Lee,i took aas last fall with the hope that it will be worth it it she was so unclear about so many things and there was even an instance when she told us what she wanted in our paper on the day it was due she also throws occasionally insensitive comments out there so watch out did i learn yes but not from her
8422,Neil  Heywood,labs are short tests really cover what is covered in class textbook is not used
8423,Neil  Heywood,heywood is a great guy he is full of knowledge and his passionate about the subjects that he teaches all of his test and quizzes you can do by yourself or in groups on your own time outside of class he gives you them a week ahead of time so you have to cram for anything he tape records all his lectures and powerpoints and puts them on d2l
8424,Neil  Heywood,i would never take a class with him again he was a nice enough guy and gave us many opportunities to get a good grade however his were very hard and very stressful i felt as if going to class was pointless because the questions on were nothing like what he talked about in class absolutely infuriating
8425,Neil  Heywood,environmental hazards is a great class should be renamed to search and rescue dr heywood brings alot of experience to the class from his navy days he is a great person to talk to and to get to know but be warned hes a talker for sure
8426,Neil  Heywood,very good teacher highly recommend him as a teacher if you have to take geo he makes the work easy to understand and worth learning
8427,Neil  Heywood,phenomenal professor lectures were easy to listen to and fairly interesting even if geography your favorite subject helpful guy and quizzes are all online and they are fair highly recommend heywood if you want a nice grade in a credit course
8428,Neil  Heywood,heywood is an absurdly easy prof his attitude is your grade is what matters not how you get it so all the tests are online you can do them in groups the quizzes have exact questions a few days ahead of time online etc that said funny smart and not hard to listen to in lecture and got an epic beard total badass
8429,Neil  Heywood,great professor records every lecture and puts them online in case you miss class grade labs makes the class accessible if you do the work it is impossible to not get an a he understands the value of experiences and understands that we have hours a week to spend on the material outside of class great professor funny too
8430,Neil  Heywood,for intro level course he was impossible to listen to i know if it was his odd mannerisms or slow drawn out style but i found it impossible to pay attention in a subject i love the material in class was less than half of what was on the test reading the dry text was mandatory
8431,Neil  Heywood,heywood is an amazing professor he is one of very few whom i truly believe understands the real world and its workings willing to help you out with most anything even if it has nothing to do directly with geography very insightful understanding and helpful would definately take courses from him again easy a in a credit course
8432,Neil  Heywood,he really does make it easy for student however i feel like he has any ability to teach very hard to understand but you need to listen in lectures to pass
8433,Neil  Heywood,neil is a great professor very passionate about students and the material all tests and quizzes are online he also gives you the pdf file of the before hand so you can print it off and work on it with a group before submitting it online easy credit a if you are willing to put the time into it which is not a hard task to do
8434,Neil  Heywood,prof heywood is an awesome teacher the reason into geography today very helpful and he always has something interesting to say
8435,Neil  Heywood,this was a good class pretty easy he is a very understanding guy and willing to help and likes answering questions from students labs were not graded but you needed to attend to understand concepts graded on lab quizzes of total grade each and exams of total grade each quizzes and exams online
8436,Neil  Heywood,he records his lectures and puts them online the labs are not graded you get the tests and quizzes beforehand he even encrourages you to work with others on them and then you post your answers online d2l he also curves slightly
8437,Neil  Heywood,it is a more difficult credit class but in the end your grade could be better than what you may think he can be very helpful but you must approach him you should have some interest in the atmosphere biosphere and lithosphere
8438,Neil  Heywood,probably the easiest five credit class you can take at point doesnt grade the labs you grade is determined by quiz and exam scores really nice guy willing to help whenever you need it
8439,Neil  Heywood,a funny guy he started out every class with a half an hour talk about stuff not related to class at all and often made it seem like the world is ending but i guess it kept the class interesting course content gets confusing but grades usually end up higher than i thought they would be
8440,Neil  Heywood,what is this guy talking about he teaches like its an advanced course i tried really really hard ended up doing ok interesting when hes not talking about class material he makes a lot of things seem like they are going to create armagedon strange guy
8441,Neil  Heywood,does an outstading job only testing you on what you should have learned labs are quite easy and lectures are very well paced
8442,John  Beneski,beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry you need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head in order to get a good grade you have to be able to apply the material in the test start to prepare for the test weeks in advance its doable
8443,John  Beneski,he makes bio so hard to understand very smart but know how to make the material easy to understand at all i studied incredibly hard for his exams worked with friends etc and failed all exams there are exams all worth points he crams weeks work of material into one exam you will be lost with him as your teacher
8444,John  Beneski,worst professor at wcu i have never had such a rude uncaring professor his lectures do little to prepare you for the exam and his power points are confusing and have slim to none useful info on them i am pretty sure he is glad that his class is close to impossible not sure why a professor because it seems like he hates students his job
8445,John  Beneski,the class needs a complete upgrade from the way information is given the lectures are very heavy and dry with plenty of terms and functions being explained in a short amount of time beneski does not give study guides test reviews worksheets or any practice work to help you before the exams he flys through info most students rely on tutors
8446,John  Beneski,i studied for hours made over note cards and watched videos on the topics he had on his slides the slides have no information on them none of that helped me with his exam as they are all applied questions and extra material not in the slides he does not answer any my emails with questions and simply does not care he is horrible and rude
8447,John  Beneski,the material is extremely dull but he really makes you remember that it is dull he tries to confuse you but you just need to write down every single thing he says if you attend every class and take notes you will pass i studied a lot from the terms of words and it helped a ton even though his last two tests seemed foreign
8448,John  Beneski,a lot of people blame beneski for his teaching style but really it is just a difficult course if you attend every lecture take good notes and study what he says you should be able to do decently on the tests even if you understand what he is saying write it down and study it later because it will most likely be on the test
8449,John  Beneski,beneski clearly knows his stuff but does not know how to teach it to others lectures are boring and monotone making it very difficult to focus tests expect you to completely understand every aspect of the material as well as be able to apply it to situations recommend studying for tests weeks in advance record the lectures and watch videos
8450,John  Beneski,he is okay at explaining things but definitely go to class the slides are useless recording the lectures is helpful because the tests are extremely hard be careful with the online quizzes too he never reminds you and easy to miss and forget about
8451,John  Beneski,he is trash i had tests and lab practicals and each test and practical was completely different than the last making it almost impossible to know how to study the lab practicals in particular were a complete from each other we basically guaranteed me to fail he is mean uncaring and he likes to make rules to hurt you
8452,John  Beneski,he really knows what hes talking about but he the best teacher lectures are very monotone and the only grades are exams and a month he tell you about any deadlines you are just expected to know when the tests are and when the are due his class does not coinside with the lab at all
8453,John  Beneski,interesting material but beneski is really dry he has a few good jokes but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard it is doable
8454,John  Beneski,beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy but he is not the best at teaching it he lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so i recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams you need to put at least hours in a week if you want a good grade
8455,John  Beneski,extremely hard class and teaching styles do not help recorded the lectures and studied for hours on end and could still only manage best bet is to watch videos on the topics because the tests are all applied questions good luck
8456,John  Beneski,dr beneski has a pretty monotoned voice but he knows his stuff his lectures are dry and can be ridiculously boring but going is essential and worth it it is a hard course but it is totally doable flash cards will be your lifesaver
8457,John  Beneski,tests are extremely difficult definitely go to lecture and read the textbook
8458,John  Beneski,beneski is an intellegent man he knows what he is talking about but is an awful professor he has no idea on how to relay the message anatomy is a comprehensive class in which you have to take a question test in minutes its absoutley obsurd i got roofied one weekend and he let me retake a quiz i had my hospital records also
8459,John  Beneski,some people are not used to the terminology so that can get confusing if you already have prior knowledge about anatomy the two most important things are attending lecture and taking really good notes his tests are all based off of what he says so reread your notes to understand thoroughly
8460,John  Beneski,dr beneski was by far the worst professor i have ever had he was impatient cocky and he was not very good at explaining the material most students have to retake his courses and he is proud of it i strongly suggest you steer clear of this professor
8461,John  Beneski,beneski is a little monotone but if you pay attention very good at explaining and the class can be easy skip class he has powerpoints online but he goes into much more detail during class say something once and it might pop up on a test take good notes overall a good teacher
8462,Tim  Grover,very helpful and outgoing tests difficult if you actually do the reading and note taking i will take every class i can with dr grover
8463,Tim  Grover,best professor ever learned everything from mapping and rock formations to life lessons from the best i have ever had
8464,Tim  Grover,great professor loved the classes
8465,Tim  Grover,a great teacher and his classes are fun you just have to pay close attention and never get by if you go to class
8466,Tim  Grover,all i learned was that he was obsessed with very small dinosaur anatomy certain parts really fascinated him which made the class pretty amusing
8467,Tim  Grover,i took a class with tim for geology it was a level class but the tests are soo hard hes a great teacher but you have to really study and not dick around if you want to do well
8468,Tim  Grover,dr grover is one of best teachers he is interesting and real his class is not easy but if you show up and take notes you should be okay he makes learning fun he is very intelligent if you get the chance take his class you wont regret it

8476,Trish  Root,i loved professor root i had her for body conditioning and she was so nice and amazing the class works you and make you feel like had a good work out root really cares about her job and her students i would definitely take again
8477,Trish  Root,this class was interesting and an easy a really trish just wants you to show that you are involved in this class she is a clear grader and her readings are all online saves you a textbook her tests give you two chances to pass so that makes it really convenient
8478,Trish  Root,i learned many things about health science from her class class discussion posts are confusing hard to follow she gives extra credits so if you work hard be fine read the material carefully and do quiz no textbook everything is online
8479,Trish  Root,you can tell she loves to teach incredible helpful and fair no textbook required all reading is online her syllabus is very clear would highly recommend taking a class with her she is also a phys ed instructor so you might see her around the wellness center a lot
8480,Trish  Root,i have taken classes with trish and she is pretty amazing if you have taken biology or chemistry before health class should be easy a gives a lot of extra credit and her assignments are so fun to do
8481,Trish  Root,very fun class nice teacher loved the set up of the online course and no text book use

8487,Trish  Root,trish is great i got a good workout of the class beat my scores on the final fitness test compared to the initial fitness test and had a wonderful time getting in shape in total body conditioning i only wish we could have spent more time on the cardio demanding workouts trish is fun and funny take her
8488,Trish  Root,nice
8489,Trish  Root,trish is understanding and easy to work with she is really nice and she explains everything on a weekly basis for online learning lots of reading though and lots of home work she did give a midterm and a quiz only a couple days away nice but hard
8490,Trish  Root,trish is great i had so much fun in her step sculpt class we were always doing new stuff so it was never boring and i lost i took it last quarter i loved it so much that taking it again this quarter
8491,Trish  Root,really nice and makes an effort to get to know you her class is definitely challenging but the benefits are great i had an okay time in her class it the best time but it horrific either
8492,Trish  Root,great teacher she is patient and laid back i took her for total body conditioning she is sweet and teaches well
8493,Trish  Root,online class too much reading too many unimportant details in the readings it is poorly written which makes it difficult to read and understand
8494,Trish  Root,challenging but fun pe class great teacher
8495,Thomas  Monarque,awesome
8496,Thomas  Monarque,awesome teacher i looked forward to going to his class funny helpful and caring you have four homework assignments which are just a paragraph each you need to do a ten minute presentation you have to read a good book and write a summary about it the his class is easy such a nice man his class is fun
8497,Thomas  Monarque,favorite professor ever only one final paper and then exams easy class was intersting and he always had people laughing mouth like a truck driver sometimes doesnt hold back doesnt teach by the book never had to open it once during the semester either had him for criminology and juvenile justice take him for every class that you can
8498,Thomas  Monarque,good guy a little conservative for my personal taste but comes with the course background has a mouth like a truck driver so if you are offended by language i would avoid otherwise take him funny and entertaining
8499,Thomas  Monarque,this guy rules never took attendance but class was so interesting always wanted to go whatever he is teaching take it exams are take home one small paper teaches from experience and great stories
8500,Thomas  Monarque,great teacher doesnt rely on book that much and teaches from expierence has great stories lets us out early and gives a easy take home midterm great class to take highly recommended

8507,Frederick  Phelps,took him for physics in sports many years ago and he was horrible absolutely horrible how i wound up with a b in there was this i taught myself and got my hands on a practice exam outside of that he was useless then
8508,Frederick  Phelps,i do not recommend this professor he often mumbles so it is very hard to take notes and he does not follow the book he is very disorganized and when he looses your papers he holds you accountable he is also very unreachable since he does not use his email or blackboard this class is set for the student to fail and is very stressful
8509,Frederick  Phelps,horrible teacher avoid at all costs he writes all the exams himself so they are filled with errors you teach yourself the class and he talks about his dead dog ginger constantly and uses her in of the exam questions
8510,Frederick  Phelps,do not take this professor the exams are a load of crap he teach anything on it and we would spend a whole class talking about two equations that we he openly admitted we have to learn he lost my first exam come to class because he lost track of time i withdrew from this class as fast as i could horrible
8511,Frederick  Phelps,a gpa student and i dropped this course because of that man behind the podium the most unreasonable arrogant man i may possibly have ever met overall a useless professor that takes advantage of his paycheck do not take any class he is associated with i wasted around because i read his ratings learn from my mistake
8512,Frederick  Phelps,absolute worst professor any one in college could ever take he does absolutely nothing to help the students half of what he teaches had nothing to do with the class i actually tried to go in to his office hours to ask for help but after one question he smiled laughed and turned his back on me overall rude and the most useless profesor
8513,Frederick  Phelps,worst professor ever had i took physics in high school and got an a taking him i thought that maybe college physics was just more difficult but i needed the physics credit so i took the class with a different prof and got an a it really is him he really be teaching anymore
8514,Frederick  Phelps,short and simple you teach yourself physics do not have him as your teacher
8515,Frederick  Phelps,this is the most terrible professor i ever had refuses to answer questions he has admitted many times he does not know how to do some of the homework problems the average on the open book tests are always about percent i have gotten all in college and got a c in this class he will not curve tests stay away from this professor
8516,Frederick  Phelps,i think well past his prime mentally speaking but he is a really nice guy and made sure to help us in any way possible in office ours going over hmwk in class giving extracredit open note exams with questions often coming straight from lecture or homework
8517,Frederick  Phelps,had this professor twice now for two different classes and he tries to teach the exact same material he told us in class that he expects us to learn it on our own and he expects that we will fail with having a open note open book and partner test and the class average was do not take this professor
8518,Frederick  Phelps,this guy is horrible his lectures are pointless he doesnt know how to use a computer so good luck getting your grade he doesnt answer questions in class i made appointments to see him in his office and he only showed for he builds on the easy material in the book to make them tougher.do not take this prof
8519,Frederick  Phelps,worst prof ever class was a lab it had little to do with actual physics if you followed his instructions perfectly he would still tell you it is wrong and walk away without explaining a bit take him if you can help it
8520,Frederick  Phelps,i am completely lost in this class never taken a physics class and considering the fact that i want to go into music i thought musical acoustics would be an awesome class i have not learned a thing and i feel like failing thank goodness for the credit option
8521,Frederick  Phelps,do not take this professor the class seems like it will be easy on the first day because you get take home exams open note quizzes and most of the homework problems done for you in class however since phelps does everything different than the book and explain things you will not learn anything which means the exams suck avoid
8522,Frederick  Phelps,this class took up a lot of my time i got in you need to utilize office hours but all of his tests are take home and he reuses them from past years find a group that suits you well and you can get an a he offers between points extra credit on every exam and the quizzes every thursday are straight from the notes
8523,Frederick  Phelps,i love dr phelps if you take the time to go to his office hours he will help you with anything you need he helps a lot with homework and even exam questions he does tend not to teach much during class but he makes up for it during office hours
8524,Frederick  Phelps,if you have phelps be prepared to teach yourself physics as everyone else has said he gives no partial credit so be surprised to get a lot of zeros on quizzes or test questions only benefit of taking him is that you get take home exams which is good only if you know what doing
8525,Frederick  Phelps,worst teacher of my life i have had some pretty bad teachers this man by far was the worst i would never take another class with him if my life depended on it if you have him drop it soon
8526,Frederick  Phelps,awful teacher he teach the concepts associated with physics when you go to his office hours for help make you sit and wait while he takes personal calls then he talks down to you he will mark correct answers wrong if he doesnt think in his opinion you knew how to do it take any other physics teacher
8527,Rick  Olguin,professor is hilarious all class periods are predominantly lectures there is a lot of reading outside of class some of which didnt seem very valuable hardly anything is assigned and this class is an easy
8528,Rick  Olguin,rick is such a great prof i feel like i can just sit back and learn in his class no homework or reading chapters assigned but not mandatory i dont see why anyone would object amazing lectures and easy a only downside is that he has cancelled class without email swears a lot very knowledgeable about worldly issues which is refreshing
8529,Rick  Olguin,recommend rick his american gov course was amazing he gave very interesting and sometimes even entertaining lectures and he makes the course very relatable to self it was definitely not what i thought it would bei had imagined a boring textbookreading heavy classand i appreciate his way of teaching so much gotta love rick
8530,Rick  Olguin,omg best teacher in north seattle college i wish every teacher would be like rick
8531,Rick  Olguin,amazing and funny lectures has a very honest view of american government which i enjoy his quizzes and papers are super easy i literally read learned nothing and still got a make sure you turn stuff in because if not he might not get back to you to turn in late work also assignments are due at pm not
8532,Rick  Olguin,rick is a wonderful professorengaging intellectual and intelligent he is passionate about political science and how it affects daily life lectures can be dramatic amusing and poignant although you probably need to take notes work is minimal i ended up writing down many inspirational things he said awesome class and teacher
8533,Rick  Olguin,this professor has an innate understanding of the american government and taught it in a way that students could relate to i really enjoyed his lectures i came into this class prepared with a notebook thinking that be a lot of powerpoint notes have to write down but i was mostly just writing down quotes of cool stuff he said
8534,Rick  Olguin,i had olguin before for political science and loved his class his classes are entertaining and very easy but the fact that he gets students involved and to actually think outside of the box is what gets our mind rolling i like that he finds interesting ways to engage the students in projects lectures and different perspectives of the mind
8535,Rick  Olguin,take him for ps he says f word a lot but everyone likes it his lectures are inspirational never get bored listen to him he assumes that students know everything about the us government and he expects you to know a lot i know a thing so ended up dropping the class but definitely come back for those great lectures when im ready
8536,Rick  Olguin,i actually liked him until the end of quarter he post the grades for any extra credits and even the final therefore i had no clue of how i got a grade lower than what i expected when i asked him politely about that after the quarter ended he was being very careless at answering my questions i will never in my life take his class again
8537,Rick  Olguin,easy a class can be confusing just follow all the required materials goodluck
8538,Rick  Olguin,rick is the only professor ever had that describe as badass done some acting in the past and it shows his lectures are engaging funny and thorough enough to be thoughtprovoking seriously each one of his lectures sounds like own ted talk by the end he is also very open to student input and answers questions on the fly
8539,Rick  Olguin,i took his american gov class online during the summer i read the textbook took notes and looked at his supplemental materials however for his quizzes it was unclear what to study for the practices tests were nothing like the actual ones however he is very easy to get in touch with and responds quickly to
8540,Rick  Olguin,rick is an amazing teacher he is not your typical community college teacher he is highly educated and so passionate his lectures are interesting and probative every single day he is technologically savvy and utilizes many internet resources during lecture this is my second class with him and i have never been bored during a single lecture
8541,Rick  Olguin,rick is an awesome instructor i am about to take my third class from him if you are easily offended or want someone to reassure you all the time he not the teacher for you rick will give you the easy a but if you want to learn he has a lot to teach you go to the first day and you will know if you are going to enjoy his class
8542,Rick  Olguin,really good teacher overall and very passionate about his subject if you like essay tests you will fail main grades are from an essay midterm and final not hard if you do some preparation he lets you have notes during it i will take his classes again and i recommend him watch out you may actually enjoy his lectures
8543,Rick  Olguin,very knowledgeable about the american government each class is a lecture and youre graded only on quizzes submitted through angel online and two bluebook exams all quiz material is based on the textbook and not his lectures so if you miss a day or a few days then just make sure to keep up with the textbook
8544,Rick  Olguin,very knowledgeable about his subject quizzes and essay tests are the only grades given so be sure to prepare for those
8545,Rick  Olguin,mr olguin is an eccentric and awesome teacher he is not like most teachers that offer you a strict regiment of course load that you must adhere to and demand that you understand it in a certain way your curiosity and inquisitiveness is the limit in this class u will be rewarded for the work you do students are like sheep you must be a wolf
8546,Rick  Olguin,sometimes interesting lecturer but terribly scattered and disorganized he canceled many classes with no warning and no substitute pretty easy grade if you half pay attention not recommended
8547,Brett  Tjaden,pros this class is what he really likes doing so he gets pretty exited about it fun projects if you have time for them cons projects can be really hard if you have no experience in computer forensics reads off slides overall amidst the dry lectures and hard projects the class was really cool and the professor was helpful too
8548,Brett  Tjaden,brett is a really nice and fun professor he cares a lot about this subject forensics and lectures were always really interesting to me his class consists of just projects and a final the projects are challenging and can be time consuming but they are overall fair he does a good job of helping you out if you need it
8549,Brett  Tjaden,dr tjaden is such a dark spot among all the other great professors in the department every class was lecture read word for word from the textbook slides projects do not have clear criteria and require you talking to him a dozen times to actually understand them majorly disappointed in this class and professor
8550,Brett  Tjaden,pas are impossible unless you are a c wizard
8551,Brett  Tjaden,of the grade was pas which were group based if you got a bad group you had to do a ton of work on your own it is able to be done solo if you have a lot of time tests were straightforward and all from material taught in class show up and pay attention know how to program in c and get an a tjaden is a nice guy and willing to help
8552,Brett  Tjaden,tjaden is extremely smart and really knows his stuff but this class is hard there is a ton of individual work to be done his lectures are helpful but google honestly helped me way more than his lectures
8553,Brett  Tjaden,this was a networking course however the projects required writing programs and the grades were based on how well you program was written and how well it worked it really matter how well you may know networking
8554,Brett  Tjaden,one of the best teachers ever had he is fair and straight forward very reasonable very clear and lucid in his assignments nothing out of the ordinary which is a god send in computer science best professor in the department
8555,Brett  Tjaden,meanest professor at jmu at least thats what he wants everyone to think really nice guy great teacher knows his stuff i hear he can give a lot of work but for this class much i looked forward to every class especially halloween birthday and talk like a pirate day he dresses up
8556,Brett  Tjaden,i actually looked forward to this class every week very well organized notes and a good lecturer very helpful outside of class also take him if you get the chance
8557,Brett  Tjaden,this guy has some serious issues i suggest avoiding him at all cost you can get online and teach yourself way more than this jackass could ever convey
8558,Brett  Tjaden,good class
8559,Brett  Tjaden,the hardest class i ever loved
8560,Brett  Tjaden,great class not too hard i learned a lot
8561,Brett  Tjaden,best class i ever took
8562,Brett  Tjaden,no comments
8563,Brett  Tjaden,very tough grading can be easier in giving grades and assignments
8564,Brett  Tjaden,made the class a lot more difficult than it should have been give clear instructions and started changing the material half way through it expect to spend rediculous amounts of time in the lab
8565,Brett  Tjaden,excellent
8566,Charles  Dirks,professor dirks is a great and inspirational leader
8567,Charles  Dirks,professor dirks is the main man
8568,Charles  Dirks,the best
8569,Charles  Dirks,i took him for five classes i learned more about history of government than i ever thought i would a very entertaining teacher that kept me wanting to come back to class every single time
8570,Charles  Dirks,easy a talks alot but has interesting things to say
8571,Charles  Dirks,dirks can have interesting lectures but sat through some lectures that had absolutely nothing to do with poli sci he just blabbed for an hour and a half about his wife or some movie he saw his blabbing is entertaining though and seen him cry
8572,Sue  Parker,dr parker is a very nice lady but this was the worst class taken at ua if you are a business major do not take this class much better off taking an entrepreneurship class in the business school actually learn something relative to modern day the hour class is all lecture from slides you could print and read yourself
8573,Sue  Parker,awesome mrs parker is a great business professor along with life coach for the class in entrepreneurship she loves what she does and is very interesting with the care and affection to her students as if she is your mother or grandmother her class with mr hester was great and will cherish the class forever class was a life changing experience
8574,Sue  Parker,great person
8575,Sue  Parker,she did not explain her assignments very well and when did not clarify when we needed to turn things in she was extremely disorganized as well the class was easy but all we did was listen to her read notes outloud that we could print off the internet the class time was used very poorly
8576,Sue  Parker,no comments
8577,Sue  Parker,she was very unorganized and did not actually teach she is very nice and i believe she helps you with your grade too
8578,Sue  Parker,no comments
8579,Sonia  Werner,excellent teacher
8580,Sonia  Werner,the class was too easy and very poor by college standards i transferred to a better school after being disappointed by how juvenile the course is the professor while friendly comes off too selfcentered at times and not very knowledgeable
8581,Sonia  Werner,too easy
8582,Sonia  Werner,soni is such a happy outgoing person she makes going to class worthwhile and her classes are designed to make sure you understand what talking about so as long as you show up and have a positive attitude do well
8583,Sonia  Werner,after attending another college i have changed my opinion of soni from really good to wonderful she is so willing to work with the group and one on one she is also a fantastic transfer counselor
8584,Sonia  Werner,no comments
8585,Sonia  Werner,soni is an excellent teacher she is really committed to student development i loved having her for a teacher
8586,Sonia  Werner,soni is such a great teacher she teaches in an interesting manner and uses real life examples
8587,Sonia  Werner,no comments
8588,Thane  Glenn,it is mandatory to take religion at bryn athyn and i did so without the best attitude however thane and the new approach to religion is thoughtful and inspiring it is quite evident that thane really cares about the material he is teaching and the students i am a better person for having had this class
8589,Thane  Glenn,very knowledgeable on the subject amusing way of communicating all around a nice dude
8590,Thane  Glenn,awesome
8591,Thane  Glenn,one of the best english teachers ever had

8593,Thane  Glenn,good teacher

8599,Linda  Dessner,she is the worst teacher ever she is really unfair when she give your work back in our class there is a girl who cant speak english she passes the class bc of her politeness but i got c even i dont have any c in my work she is the worst teacher if you are going to be in her class i would prefer to shoot myself i hate her
8600,Linda  Dessner,every week essays every week essays what the heck is that i am tired of writing her essays i almost wrote a thick book because of her oh my god i explain my feelings
8601,Linda  Dessner,oh man oh man what more can i say
8602,Linda  Dessner,too many essays and work we have other classes you know very stubborn and disagreeable esl why so difficult class is easy for me because i was accidently placed there
8603,Suzanne  Bernhardt,take this course if ready to be treated like you did nothing great outside of class but her way or the high way
8604,Suzanne  Bernhardt,often unfair and arbitrary in her grading
8605,Suzanne  Bernhardt,she is very strict and hard on students but when the class i took with her was over i realized that i learned a lot more than i learn with easy teachers shes also very passionate about what she teaches
8606,Suzanne  Bernhardt,no comments
8607,Suzanne  Bernhardt,good
8608,Suzanne  Bernhardt,very helpful and educated
8609,Suzanne  Bernhardt,i think that she is a very good teacher for speech i am not sure that some of her views that she might express align correctly with the foundemental beliefs of bryn athyn college but she did not generally express these views in speech
8610,Suzanne  Bernhardt,this is where a good teacher
8611,Suzanne  Bernhardt,ugh take writing from suzanne a better teacher at speech and theater
8612,Suzanne  Bernhardt,worst teacher ever
8613,Suzanne  Bernhardt,either her way or the highway if her way fine and can be in her club if you have a different oppinion better invest in body armor because you will be attacked but in her defense i think aware that she does it change the fact that she does
8614,Suzanne  Bernhardt,no comments
8615,Suzanne  Bernhardt,very particular about the topics and views she wants to read in the papers if she like it then she seems to keep the grade low she can be nice as a person but a tad boring as a teacher in this classgoing over grammar rules instead of how to write a good essay
8616,Suzanne  Bernhardt,oh my gosh
8617,Suzanne  Bernhardt,i say that i dislike her because i do not she and i had very different views about the world which just mix she is a good teacher when it comes to theatre though or at least thats what i hear
8618,Suzanne  Bernhardt,i heard she was gone i hope so she is not to be trusted be nice until you screw up and then wish you never knew her i have not been the same since she screwed with my life
8619,A J  Senchack,anybody who does not think prof senchack is one of the best teachers ever is sorely mistaken and likely lazy people who feel embarrassed only do so because they do not properly prepare for class the few who actually put in effort are rewarded with one of the most rewarding experiences learning in the field of finance
8620,A J  Senchack,took him for business research and writing main thing i have to say is if i never see him again it will be too soon within the first week of class he insulted a student really good at telling you how wrong and stupid you are but tell you what he wants and how to fix it very particular but tell you specifics until afterwards
8621,A J  Senchack,old fashioned nothing visual all term confusing circuitous lectures class was a killer stay away
8622,A J  Senchack,extremely rude publicly embarassed students on several occasions without legitimate justification i will never take another class from him and would not recommend him to any other students
8623,A J  Senchack,wonderful professor cares about students and is highly dedicated to the topics he teaches
8624,A J  Senchack,unprofessional waste of time taking his classes
8625,A J  Senchack,always makes class interesting
8626,A J  Senchack,easily sidetracked but his tangents are very amusing
8627,A J  Senchack,no comments
8628,A J  Senchack,another wonderful prof you learn so much from him
8629,Vickie  Lair,this lady is crazy i took her for calc expecting it to be not as bad and boy was i wrong she makes no efforts to make sure her students succeed hammers everyone on grading and her tests are impossible not to mention the racist rant she went on in the middle of my class she can explain it well but other than that awful stay away
8630,Vickie  Lair,i definitely would not recommend taking her class she is a nice woman but not the best teacher she teaches the easy things pretty well but when it comes to the confusing stuff she speeds right through it she gives out way too much homework online and worksheets and accept any excuses she is also very stingy about grading
8631,Vickie  Lair,mrs lair is the best math teacher i have ever had she is very organized with her lecture notes and explains things very clearly she is willing to help whenever a student asks a question however you must be prepared for the class if you know the prerequisite material for the course you are in big trouble be responsible
8632,Vickie  Lair,i think one of the pitfalls reviewers of lair fell into was not going to see her or staying a few minutes after class to ask questions she looked scary set tough rules but when talked to she relaxed many of the rules was very helpful her class is par for the course its math requires work out side of class to pass o look for it
8633,Vickie  Lair,vickie lair is the worst teacher i have ever had i would not be in her class if it the only opening left wonder why confusing forgetful and very unreasonable when it comes to class she post grades ever your responsibility her reviews for tests are barely that and she crams everything together take her
8634,Vickie  Lair,horrible she was no help and gets confused as she writes on the board
8635,Vickie  Lair,she has to be the worst teacher i have ever had i got a problem wrong on my hw simply because i didnt put a dash in my z so she argued that it was a i would have problems correct but still have no points for the problems because of fact she requires you document every single step even the minor ones dont take her class
8636,Vickie  Lair,she grades way to hard taking points off for a misplaced negative sign even if the answer is right i asked her for help pulling my grade up and she said smart figure it out she gets confused and when asked a question just repeats how she explained it before until they give up and say they get it do not take her
8637,Vickie  Lair,mrs lair turned out to be a great teacher she seems scary but do not be afraid to ask her questions her homework is tough but will help you in the long run if you plan on going any further with math she was more than willing to meet with me outside of class
8638,Vickie  Lair,i went over a homework problem with this woman we went over it twice and she told me everything was correct i turned it in and when i got it back i got points for that same problem that how she grades i strongly recommend you not take any of her classes
8639,Vickie  Lair,never take her thanks god not teaching next semester because i have to retake her class makes students feel stupid which immediately drops my interest in the class very hard grader to a ridiculous point and gets confused in her own words which confused everyone because we even know how to approach the problem horrible experience
8640,Vickie  Lair,do not take her class she made things so much harder then they needed to be she makes you show work for every tiny detail simple adding and subtracting i listen to a review i read and took the course listen to this one and dont
8641,Vickie  Lair,god awful teacher do not take this instructor she does not explain anything well you are better off reading the book yourself then even going to lecture pissed i even payed for this quality of education it would not be worth my time if it was free
8642,Vickie  Lair,very hard teacher i get straight in my previous math courses in college but could not learn from her very picky should have dropped earlier to get a refund but i decided to stick it out dropped just before first test as i knew she teach me only concerned with getting through material not how well she covers or explains it
8643,Vickie  Lair,she was not a helpful professor she always had to derive an equation and prove it her method of grading was awful at the end of the course she had to drop of the lowest homework grades because the entire class was doing so poorly
8644,Vickie  Lair,she was a hard grader but she always explained what was deficient clearly the homework was not extremely long except on a few instances she had trouble with a new book this quarter but she graded us less harshly where she knew we would have troubles her lecture often differed from the book but her lectures were indepth and explanatory
8645,Vickie  Lair,she takes off points for simple arithmetic on our last test she made us memorize ten problems that were all fairly similar she did so because she thinks we should compete with her calculus class she rarely teaches from the actual book and instead teaches from her own notes which are not available unless you copy them
8646,Vickie  Lair,try to stay away from this professor rarely prepared for class will often not lecture for a section gives a handout covering section instead gives pop quizzes if a phone rings does not give enough time for tests.she gave a test that contained a problem that she was unable to solve gives preferential treatment to students she appears to like
8647,Vickie  Lair,always unclear as to what you should study for tests which made them very difficult at times
8648,Vickie  Lair,omg this teacher is a hard grader she will take off if simple math that you can do in your head is not written down properly she overexplains material to the point where just confusing oh yea and forget to leave your cell phone in class before you use the restroom or pop quiz
8649,Judy  Adams,worst class the lecture is word for word from the book with unclear explanations and no way to answer questions this class was not supposed to be hard but it was and more difficult with this instructor she spent more time talking about investing in stocks and how she started a business when she was years old than she did teaching
8650,Judy  Adams,run away even though i was warned about her horrid teaching skills i still took the class thinking i could pass by learning independently or with a tutor i was soo wrong take stats with judy her philosophy on teaching is students read the text book three times and ask questions worst teacher i have ever had ever
8651,Judy  Adams,taught using videos for the first three weeks of class
8652,Judy  Adams,not worth driving to make it to class when all you need is the book in her class she doesnt teach and expects you to just know it she also expects hours every night for homework grades are based on tests
8653,Judy  Adams,absolutely horrible she know how to teach she teaches word for word out of the book and when you ask a question she answer it avoid this professor if at all possible if she want to answer your question she will yell at you and kick you out totally pointless to even show up for class i can teach better than she can
8654,Judy  Adams,judy is a horrible horrible teacher i am actually confused on why she even has a job still she teach you anything but rather plays a video of another person teaching the lesson and basically the class if you ask her a question she does not answer it pretty sure i could teach the class better than her
8655,Judy  Adams,shes the worst math teacher ever had i feel like she know the material if she does she teach it at all her tests are not what she teaches not even worth doing the hours of homework every night because only worth points anyways she want to help or explain she yells at you if you ask for help
8656,Judy  Adams,if you enjoy paying a teacher that teach and only shows videos during class because she know the material than your perfect teacher
8657,Judy  Adams,absolutely the worst teacher i have ever had she makes you feel like a moron if you ask questions
8658,Judy  Adams,spoke directly from the book prepare her own notes was surprised by the answers to the problems she was reading out loud from the book
8659,Judy  Adams,refuses to answer questions does not explain steps to problems only reads from the book if you struggle with math at any leveldo not take her she moves on even if you understand doesnt follow through on her help
8660,Judy  Adams,horrible teacher do not take this class with her
8661,Judy  Adams,she was argumentative and often had to correct herself she also would not let students try to give other explanations or examples very frustrating
8662,Judy  Adams,would not recommend
8663,Judy  Adams,poor judy she really is a nice lady but nice help you understand math she reaally sucks at explaining anything she fills in class time with calculator work and random stories about her travels i am taking stats from her which is like a foreign language to begin with she avoids your questions too dodge her class if you can
8664,Judy  Adams,please please please avoid taking a class by her if at all possible if you must take one by her get a tutor the instant you can sign up for one you will need one she is so hard to follow and answer questions very well
8665,Judy  Adams,please avoid if you want to learn anything i went to class and hour before class started and taught my classmates through the course since i had already taken it
8666,Judy  Adams,math
8667,Judy  Adams,she was very hard to understand in her lectures as far as the lessons were concerned she read almost everything out of the book when we asked her questions she would give us an answer that was never relevant to our questions avoid this teacher if you are looking for one that will teach you a lot
8668,Judy  Adams,had a very hard time following her when i didnt already know the subject sticks to the sylibus and will not go over anything that she had already passed in lecture aviod if at all possible
8669,John  Russell,i never read the material and made up crap for the essays and still mangae to get a b all i can say is at least he kept me interested
8670,John  Russell,rad dude
8671,John  Russell,great guy very nice you will learn from this man he is funny and will hold your attention papers are tough to write they are a different style but they are not that bad great teacher i suggest learning under him
8672,John  Russell,his papers are so hard to write he is very unclear with what his guidelines are for the paper he seriouly needs to know that we taking this class because we want to but other then that he is a very nice guy
8673,John  Russell,no comments
8674,John  Russell,talks about interesting issues even though always have anything to do with the tests but you actually learn from the discussions and the tests are very easy
8675,John  Russell,smart clear funny
8676,Brian  Rose,professor rose was phenomenal one of my favorite professors his lectures are engaging he is extremely knowledgeable about the media communications industries definitely take him if looking to learn a lot work hard have a professor who truly cares about each of his students i would absolutely take another class with him again
8677,Brian  Rose,professor rose was the only professor my first semester who really challenged me his lectures are consistently engaging but he expects a lot from each of his students if you think you can meet some high expectations take his class extremely helpful very clear in what he wants and very passionate and knowledgeable about what teaching
8678,Brian  Rose,i took professor internship seminar after taking his intro to media industries a few semesters ago absolutely nothing bad to say about the experience with this class the discussion board assignments we had were like journaling and he has a genuine interest in how students will take their careers take him you regret it
8679,Brian  Rose,professor rose gives a lot of homework and reading it is a lot to keep track of but he does send out helpful emails keeping you up to date the workload is worth it because the lectures are very interesting and the topics usually are as well beyond that prof rose is just a pleasant professor to have and his passion is contagious
8680,Brian  Rose,although the workload was intense and there was a ton of reading i hesitate to take him again this man responds to emails instantaneously and you are able to get help in an instant the assignments he gives for outside of class are very fun as well his lectures are interesting but take good notes great professor
8681,Brian  Rose,professor rose is accomplished in the industry a tough grader and he really cares about interest sit in the front answer questions come to class you need to pay attention in the lectures take good notes and read the current events articles tested on them weekly quizzes usually based on the book so yeah you need it
8682,Brian  Rose,by far the best professor i have ever had at fordham this review mirrors the others but i will reiterate the workload is intense so be prepared for multiple assignments due within days of each other midterm and final are extremely difficult however he is a phenomenal professor and i learned so much from him he knows his stuff take him
8683,Brian  Rose,one of the wisest professors i have had at fordham class is lecture style but very engaging with presentations he gives a lot of assignments but all are extremely meaningful and worth the time if you are a comm major you have to take his class will learn so be able to connect the dots between the past present and future of all media industries
8684,Brian  Rose,i had rose for the second semester in a row last semester i did alright but i found his presentations recycled for this class which was helpful he was always around for extra help and he wrote right back for emails seriously reading and homework is extensive but you only meet once a week very useful kind and funny take him if you can
8685,Brian  Rose,i love prof rose if you are majoring in communication you have to take at least one class with him he gives a lot of work but learn a lot as long as you put a little effort in do well he is lightning fast with responses if you send him a paper get it back to you in like minutes insane
8686,Brian  Rose,this man will reply to your email in less than mins i swear very hard for intro to media industries much easier for internship seminar in all fantastic professor super passionate about what he teaches by far the most useful class i have taken at fordham
8687,Brian  Rose,he gives a lot of work hw assignments are only of the grade but there are like of them in one he is a fantastic professor who encourages students to be both analytical and critical about the media industries today very engaging lecturer never a dull moment midterm final are long and really overwhelming you learn a lot
8688,Brian  Rose,more than a little self impressed asks obscure questions
8689,Brian  Rose,the king of mass comm anyone who hopes to have a career in the media industries needs to take his class
8690,Brian  Rose,professor rose was great his intro to media class was fun and i actually looked forward to it he does give a lot of work but some of it is not that bad gives quizes which are not that fun and tests are alot of writting rose is a very helpful professor and cares that you do good in his class take him if you want to learn and have fun
8691,Brian  Rose,i really enjoyed every class i had with him very informative relevant and fun his presentations were entertaining but be forewarnedthe class is a ton of work
8692,Brian  Rose,one of the best professors at fu not only is he a media god but friendly and eager to help individual students as well classes with him are actually fun esp the smaller classes and many of his students sign up for the courses he teaches just because teaching them makes you work but all the valuable has taught media execs
8693,Brian  Rose,took him for internship seminar you can tell a good professor but he gives way too much work for interns who are already slaving away giving hours a week to a course where they are getting credits too much busywork and writing that means nothing for a class that is
8694,Brian  Rose,he is a great professor the material covered is worth knowing he is not an easy grader but he puhes you to get a better grade he is very funny and keeps you awake have such a good time learning you would wish the class endured class how good he was take him take him take him and oh yeah take him
8695,Brian  Rose,tries to cover way too much material but is understanding and kind
8696,R.  Donahoe,the class and lab bad especially if you are interested in environmental geochemistry it is actually very interesting the problem is her she is very snappy she teach things right or give proper instructions on labs but then snaps at you for not knowing it
8697,R.  Donahoe,dr donahoe is very passionate about her work which makes the class so much better the homework assignments are through pearson so they can be kind of difficult the quizzes are online but pretty easy there are tests and a final not cumulative and she drops the lowest score of each category the only thing i like were the labs
8698,R.  Donahoe,i love geo and i think this was an amazing class she posts the notes online but go to class will sometimes have clicker questions for attendance the lab is easy and the tests are long but easy i would recommend her and this class
8699,R.  Donahoe,simple class very interesting material in my opinion stuff i never knew before but could help me later in life good to get a science credit has reviews outside of class before the tests go also read the textbook chapters i averaged a b on all the tests but with the lab grade and all the help she gives you i made an easy a
8700,R.  Donahoe,absolute worst professor i have had after years at alabama her class is boring you learn anything and her tests cover material she puts on her powerpoints she is so unhelpful and not understanding to anything at all do not take her
8701,R.  Donahoe,she gives weekly homeworks and if you want a good grade on it you have to go see her every single week for help she makes the tests too long to finish test and homework out of sync with lectures seems uptight and a little snarky take it unless you absolutely have to
8702,R.  Donahoe,horrible class nothing was clear and donahoe was very unhelpful if you want an easy science do not take this class
8703,R.  Donahoe,this is a course she made up herself i have honors level and above classes that are easier than this she use the book she makes you buy and the tests homework and quizzes are hard she almost constantly goes over the time were supposed to get out and then gets mad when we leave.dont take this lady unless youre a geologist i guess
8704,R.  Donahoe,very good class clicker quizzes are useless as far as grading but it does count towards the attendance this is a great course to take if you need a science credit she gives good study guides and the online quizzes will benefit you significantly also the lab required for this class is very interesting overall the best class i had in the spring
8705,R.  Donahoe,it was an ok class the clicker quizzes are useless and she puts everything online so you have to show up you can tell she tries to be nonbiased but she succeed she averages one attack on the bush administration per week overall an ok class just incredibly boring
8706,R.  Donahoe,by and large this was the worst class i have ever been in all she does is read on the powerpoint this could easily be just an online class the clicker quizes are pointless it was hard to communicate with her she kept going on and on about colorado the class is uninteresting and she help like the queen
8707,R.  Donahoe,rona donahoe is flawless she has two fendi purses and a silver lexus i hear her insured for i hear she does car in japan her favorite movie is varsity blues one time she met john stamos on a plane and he told her she was pretty one time she punched me in the face it was awesome no really though she sucks
8708,R.  Donahoe,do not take this class this class is for nonmajors but you wouldnt think so if you attend any of her lectures there are only tests including the final and some of the information is not in the powerpoints she puts online also quite boring and loves to turn the on freezing to the point where you pay attention
8709,R.  Donahoe,do not take this class it is extremely boring and attendance is mandantory she will bore you to death and the test are hard no matter what you study
8710,R.  Donahoe,this class hard but you get behind in the reading the tests are pretty difficult so just study hard and be fine
8711,R.  Donahoe,looks like dianne from cheers and has about the same personality
8712,R.  Donahoe,in this intro to environmental geology she did a great job of using different media to teach and covered the basics on a wide variety of material i learned a lot
8713,R.  Donahoe,the material is straight forward just know it all
8714,R.  Donahoe,no comments
8715,Kevin  Hanson,fantastic professor loved his teaching took documentary survey from him he opened my eyes to the art of docs which i understand before the class he makes you write so be prepared for probably decent length papers he will grade semitough but worth it some of the docs the most interesting but are valuable nonetheless
8716,Kevin  Hanson,there is no feedback from him ever i still received any scores am unsure about my grade and there is only one class left he is not clear on his expectations and give much direction
8717,Kevin  Hanson,he gets off topic very easily and spends way too much time on something that should only take a few minutes he does know a lot about his subject but he gets so distracted and tells a lot of irrelevant stories an okay class but definitely not one of my favorites
8718,Kevin  Hanson,not there to be a babysitter so if you work hard his guidance will be beneficial along the way
8719,Kevin  Hanson,anyone who gets you excited and interested in what you are studying is a stellar professor well spoken and has the best stories to tell go nova wish there were more professors like him
8720,Kevin  Hanson,
8721,Kevin  Hanson,long answers to short questions funny guy very very helpful
8722,Kevin  Hanson,a burnout
8723,Kevin  Hanson,thinks he is better than you face it he made a movie a long time ago so he is he will remind you that if you forget to bow stupid class because they stifle creativity to meet antiquated equipment standards
8724,Kevin  Hanson,an awesome class i loved taking it
8725,Kevin  Hanson,no comments
8726,Kevin  Hanson,makes you think outside the box one of the greatest teachers period
8727,Kevin  Hanson,comes off as an ancharcist hippie

8737,John  Constantino,love love love best prof at middlesex county college hated history before i took him attend class and participate and you will get an a
8738,John  Constantino,simply the best
8739,John  Constantino,incredible professor funny sweet and interesting i admired him so much we were friends outside of the classroom he belittle students but he demands attention about respect he needs to do his job you need to earn your grade with knowledge my favorite professor in my years of college would love to get in contact him again
8740,John  Constantino,
8741,John  Constantino,great teacher you will learn more in his class in one semester than any other history class available i highly advise to take his class
8742,John  Constantino,he is incredible he teaches u through the drama he creates and then with his incredible observation and knowledge abt hist he make you interested in the subject and everyone pass his class p
8743,John  Constantino,best professor i have ever had he made me interested in things i think i cared about he changed the way i looked at education anyone have his email

8748,John  Constantino,he is thee hotterst teacher in the face of the whole world he love his job and that make it easier for the students to learned i can not imagine learning much from somoeone eilse then him its hard to believed that he is not working at cc the students can really use him too
8749,John  Constantino,i once saw him swallow door handle he has the strength of nine men and can rend armies asunder with the boom of his voice he also knows a thing or two about charlemagne
8750,John  Constantino,i had no interest in history until i had him i hear he is teaching at is where i go now i will go out of my way to take him again even if i dont get credit for it i dont know who cc thinks they are for not hiring him as a professor
8751,John  Constantino,the single greatest teacher on the face of the earth the heavens opened up and deposited him in south jersey of all places the most important resource that new jersey has the east coast for that matter check that the world if you prick him he does not bleed he is a demigod of history
8752,John  Constantino,dr cos what the heck happened to all the rest of you it seems that all the good teachers have dissapeared and left us with brainless and boring professors for goodness sake on the horn and do something about it cheers franco
8753,John  Constantino,i love dr constantino the best professor i laugh in his class but i also learn normally i wait for a class to be over he always keeps you awake and alert i believe he won professor of the year and cc hire him good choice
8754,John  Constantino,he is the greatest teacher he has such a passion for teaching cumberland county stinks for not hiring him i am taking my dads money else where p.s he has a nice arse i wanna touch it
8755,John  Constantino,interesting brilliant caring amazing professor and extremely hot
8756,Daniel  Talham,talhamm my man what a gem of a professor i had him for inorganic chemistry and it was one of my favorite classes sure inorganic chemistry can be hard but this man made it worth reading the textbook looking over his notes and studying for the exams he truly made this class enjoyable his exams are very fair so worth it
8757,Daniel  Talham,amazing professor cares about his students the class is not easy yet it is doable to get a good grade requires lots of time and effort professor is helpful in office hours and makes the infomation clear and easy to understand be careful of careless mistakes class is interesting and challenging
8758,Daniel  Talham,currently enrolled in his inorganic course and he is absolutely amazing yes you will need to study yes the exams can be a bit tricky all about the time you put into studying a great lecturer and you should focus on studying the hw not graded he assigns very helpful during office hours as well
8759,Daniel  Talham,dr talham is the best professor i have had at uf had him for chem if you expect an easy a then take him he will make you work for your grade but be fair in doing so acknowledging that his class was hard he changed the grading scale to about an being an a the downside is that he travels but that is expected for a tenured prof
8760,Daniel  Talham,not helpful at all he left on two trips during the semester and did not care at all study edge and his class notes barely helped either
8761,Daniel  Talham,talham went to chemistry seminars around the world in his absence the ta would take over the course the ta sucked at lecturing talhams lectures are very interesting though he use power points i finished with an which is an a one important thing use study edge as supplement if you wish not as a learning tool understand the notes
8762,Daniel  Talham,he is a great professor and seems very cool
8763,Daniel  Talham,talham is a great guy but thinks we are geniuses he made the final very hard but because the average was pretty low he changed the grade scale to help us out a bit i had an which was an a in his class so yes its hard but the scale makes up for it i studied so hard for each exam but every exam was very difficult and he covered more topics
8764,Daniel  Talham,dan took the last two weeks of the semester off when material was taught by tas that would make up of the final exam tests were hard study at least a week in advance and read the text book he is not a horrible man or teacher hes just harder than other professors he covered two more chapters than the other chem class
8765,Daniel  Talham,dr talham was a great lecturer and very kind unfortunately he taught for years so none of his practice exams were uptodate he assigns lots of optional reading and problems but you have to do them if you use study edge being horrible at chemistry se saved my grade awesome review sessions and practice problems
8766,Daniel  Talham,avoid talham at all is an extremely uninvolved professor i believe that he does care about chemistry and teaching however he has not displayed that this semester his exams had nitpicky details and he went at a considerably faster pace than all the other teachers for this course the only practice exams provided were over years old
8767,Daniel  Talham,i would never take dr talham again was out of town the two weeks before out first exam and the week before finals tests are very hard and he gives practice exams from and which are not helpful would recommend anyone else yeah hes a nice guy but thats about it would not recommend
8768,Daniel  Talham,very knowledgeable teacher his tests are not easy but they are only of material covered in class and nothing new or tricky knows the answer to all questions and is very nice and respectful can get an a but you must work for it and study for the test a day or two in advanced fair teacher and very good balance of material learned vs difficulty
8769,Daniel  Talham,he is a super nice guy and want the best for his class that being said if you go to his office hours he turns into a mean person and kinda judges you but other than that he was awesome and would def recommend him
8770,Daniel  Talham,defiantly the best professor had for gen chem but the class is still hard i got an a using study edge they really help to explain and emphasize the most important things talham goes over recommend going to the weekly review sessions with study edge made a huge difference when it came to the exams
8771,Daniel  Talham,i absolutely loved dr talham he was very clear in his lecturing and made sure to use real world examples to accompany the topic if you ever have any questions he is always willing to answer them in terms of the exams he was very fair with his exam questions and always willing to discuss them with you after the exam great lecturer
8772,Daniel  Talham,professor talham is the best a cool guy who knows how to make chemistry interesting and a hard class accessible to students he presents the subject matter in a clear and concise manner and even hand writes the notes along with his students so you never miss anything because the professor is going too fast would take again
8773,Daniel  Talham,i loved his lecture style frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast dr talham put slides up and wrote items down on the board and explained as he went lots of great visual aids in class he made a note to learn every name in class during summer a kind guy great lecturer
8774,Daniel  Talham,can i say great and best professor best chem professor ever always helping you out explains everything as many times as you need he makes sure you learn it amazing if any questions go to office hours he will definitely help you out even if he is busy take some time to help you awesome
8775,Daniel  Talham,great teacher who explained things very clearly sometimes gives a little too much info but is overall the best chem teacher had
8776,Jennifer  Krozier,not my favorite prof we spent a lot of time on things that seemed irrelevant or politically motivated this was before the election for some reason we watched a documentary of woodstock discussing the bands and of course to support the democratic party in the election we watched bowling for columbine
8777,Jennifer  Krozier,course had a lot to do with what i felt were exceptional issues and situations and not really having any practical purpose
8778,Jennifer  Krozier,had some days of fuzzy presentations but i would reccomend this course to nonmajors who might have a interest in the subject a great amount of detail
8779,Jennifer  Krozier,very open and well organized
8780,Jennifer  Krozier,the guys love her she is a pretty good but not a great teacher
8781,Jennifer  Krozier,she is a great professor plus she has the physical features that we make sure that you come to class everyday last semester she came to class is a short skirt omg
8782,Jennifer  Krozier,good introductory course for cj majors she has a lot of experience with undergraduate students
8783,Jennifer  Krozier,sometimes vauge on grading process
8784,Jennifer  Krozier,pretty easy class she is very nice
8785,Jennifer  Krozier,she is hot funny and i would love to
8786,Jennifer  Krozier,if you get past her physical attributes you really learn something wow what a novel concept
8787,Jennifer  Krozier,i respect her for her intelligence and her ability to teach not for her looks
8788,Jennifer  Krozier,very hot
8789,Jennifer  Krozier,omg she is so hot she can arrest me any them baby
8790,Jennifer  Krozier,wow
8791,Jennifer  Krozier,great course and additional materials are a great support
8792,Jennifer  Krozier,hard to concentrate on the business at hand
8793,Jennifer  Krozier,she is very very hot and every once in a while i have to tell fred to calm down if you know what i mean
8794,Jennifer  Krozier,she is really laid back and really hot very trust worthy and she is hott
8795,Jennifer  Krozier,good lookin smart girl
8796,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,it was very difficult to earn a good grade she will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and explain it well at all if she can she sometimes refers to students for answers the programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end the review guides given are decent but very vague overall avoid this prof if possible
8797,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,she cares about students but i fond of her teaching she tended to misinterpret students questions so get a long winded answer to a question you ask she took attendance but i think lecture was necessary homework graded but preps you for quizzes
8798,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,she knows her stuff and is very helpful cs lectures can be boring so no surprise there learned a lot but i take her unless you are a major overall very personable and sweet would take again
8799,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,very ill prepared and scattered professor very often goes off on tangents that relate to the class she does not explain even basic concepts in a way that everyone can understand and instead writes definitions followed by a poor example if you understand after that sol first test had various students with grades below a
8800,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,had her for two semesters now her lectures consist of showing us various definitions and examples but not really explaining them i had to learn most things by religiously examining the textbook and watching videos online going to class always felt like a waste of time but required expect to be confused every class period
8801,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,she really teach us she shows us things she explain how to use them in certain situations which makes her a poor professor and she takes great joy in making the tests abnormally difficult
8802,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,the professor is a nightmare i understand that the professor is merely to show you a path then you go upon a journey to learn but when that professor only gives you a hammer and some nails and expects you to build the titanic when i respect her tldr she gives you basics but help you with anything else suicide for grade
8803,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,take her if you have no prior experience with coding
8804,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,possibly the worse teacher ever had her lectures were scattered and confusing and often we ended up off topic this class claims no prior programming experience however this did not feel like the case considering i felt constantly lost despite reading the book and never missing class not good for beginning programmers
8805,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,she is a tough grader tough to the point of being borderline unfair each project is correct or wrong if you had an error no matter how small you would get a zero luckily she lets you retry the homework you turned in for a slightly reduced point total which you will do a lot
8806,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,not as bad as many students on here say she is she lets you know exactly what is going to be in the tests in her study guides she covers the important topics in class i had a bit of knowledge in cs before taking this class but the class would be just fine for someone who has no background in cs
8807,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,although not receiving a bad grade at the moment i cannot deny that she is not the greatest of teachers she skips over some things in class and her assignments occasionally will cover things she did not discuss make sure you go over her review guides and do the reading and the homework otherwise probably fail go to the tutors
8808,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,fine she straight up tells you that she takes pleasure in making questions so hard that people will get them wrong
8809,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,i think it says something that the positive reviews all have negative user reviews whilst negative reviews have positive user reviews this professor is just awful stay away from this class i recieved an a so i am not just complaining her teaching style is godawful many people drop out of the major cause of her awful role model
8810,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,all in all a great professor while her tests can get rather hard she gives bonus points to make up for it and even once gave us bonus points on a point test there are only three tests and a final if you work hard and put in the effort you will easily get an a she is willing to help you the only way to fail her class is to be lazy
8811,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,she tries her hardest to get every student an a she gives bonus points we had a curve one time there are only test including the final if you read the book take notes in class and go to her office hours get a high a and i mean like or she is always asking if we understand things and stops for questions every
8812,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,i never met a teacher that truly cares for their students as much as her she is always asking for feedback on how she is teaching and if she needs to go over something again she teachers better than any teacher at truman and she knows what she is talking about people fail because they put in the work and tell her when they need help
8813,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,darehalma for cs is like shooting yourself in the foot if you a take a cs class in highschool that went over basic things b make most of your time for the class her grading is very harsh as your tests have a test review guide in which you must know everything if it correlates with anything its on there bad for beginners
8814,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,this was the worst her programs are long and the homework had no clarity at all from the textbook and her graders had to grade them without the answer key and grade a week after they are turned in along with getting the answer key her tests were long coding part she expects you to read alot from the book but goes out of order
8815,Ruthie  Dare-Halma,her programs take way too long including the tests her test questions take way too long even if you go to her office hours and go over the test she goes fast and help a lot hw assignments were dumb because she has specific answers to them and her tutors grade them without the answer key
8816,Tanya  Usyk,i took professor usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that i grew and learned a lot during my time in her class her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly she is straightforward with her expectations yes she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort
8817,Tanya  Usyk,worst handwriting ever looks like a child scribbled on the board no very helpful major bi
8818,Tanya  Usyk,loved her she was my favorite professor ever
8819,Tanya  Usyk,she was somewhat intimidating she threw a girl out of class for having a tiny notebook on her wasnt her math notebook she yelled at another student for trying to follow along and looking in his math book she is hard to follow along would not recommend her
8820,Tanya  Usyk,i dropped this class because i was failing i understand her writing so i was copying out of the book she pointed out to everyone in class that i was not paying attention i received an f from her even though i dropped
8821,Tanya  Usyk,ms usyk was very difficult to work with she was arrogant and not helpful if you take her class your pretty much on your own stay away
8822,Tanya  Usyk,i took her week course and to be honest i was scared out of my mind on my first day with her tough but she definitely knows what talking about this was my second time in the course the first time i withdrawled because i was failing and the second time around i got an a i recommend her for sure
8823,Tanya  Usyk,very livid about students talking during class she seems like an ignorant person i would not take her if i was you
8824,Tanya  Usyk,today was my first day with this teacher and i can already tell this course is going to be a tough one she seems like a very nice lady but she expects a lot from her students she have very good hand writing and she talks rather fast all in all a little nervous as to how well going to do
8825,Tanya  Usyk,also her handwriting is impossible to read which causes her to repeat everything she writes down several times
8826,Tanya  Usyk,she is consistently minutes late for class if you miss a class for any reason including death in the family even if you let her know ahead of time that you will be absent you will get a zero for the work you missed she does not allow any make ups and has really screwed some of her students over
8827,Tanya  Usyk,this teacher really knows what she is talking about once you get into the college level classes she moves rather quickly try to get as much as you can out of her lectures she like repeating herself but will answer any questions that you have if you are having any trouble she is always willing to email her students back sweet
8828,Tanya  Usyk,teacher was very helpful and made everything very understandable in highschool i got a low d in algebra in her class i got a for the semester
8829,Tanya  Usyk,ms usyk is a wonderful teacher whenever you do not understand any work she is more than willing to stay after class to help you to understand what she is teaching she is a very nice person
8830,Lena  Usyk,awful lowered by gpa so much do not take
8831,Lena  Usyk,professor usyk is great i had her for cells and molecules lab at stockton very relaxed in lab and makes class fun i would take her for lecture if i could she explains the intros very clearly and teaching is so natural for her tests seem hard but you have to put in the effort and study everything if you know the material be fine
8832,Lena  Usyk,i did not like her as a professor she was terribly boring and moved way too fast i was too busy writing her notes that i did not have time to process what she was saying i can honestly say i felt sad when i knew i was going to her class
8833,Lena  Usyk,i took professor usyk as my lab professor at stockton college and she was horrible she care about her students teach in class or help with labs she gives really tough quizzes and give you a grade until after the semester is over do not take her whatever you do
8834,Lena  Usyk,i like her as a teacher her lectures were horrible and you could tell she had no interest in teaching anatomy as a person though hysterical i loved her dry sense of humor
8835,Lena  Usyk,no comments
8836,Lena  Usyk,ms usyk is a wonderful teacher i had a selfpaced course and she was always willing to help you anytime you need to she is also a very nice person
8837,Allan R  Baer,he pretty much expects you to go to class as he often covers important concepts at the beginning of class which he forgets to record his test questions are written in a very convoluted way which makes his test questions harder his explanations in class are often garbage so you will need often learn things on your own outside of class
8838,Allan R  Baer,terrible at explaining key concepts makes uncomfortable and inappropriate sexual jokes or at least did for my classes nice dude though
8839,Allan R  Baer,great teacher who clarifies any questions
8840,Allan R  Baer,amazing prof cares about the students and really wants you to do well his lecture notes are really confusing but i think he is hoping people will make use of your textbook he really knows what he is talking about he is a very smart man i relied on my textbook a lot to the extent that going to class probably necessary
8841,Allan R  Baer,really great guy will go great lengths to help you understand and truly seems to enjoy teaching my only gripe is that if you zone out for three seconds you will be entirely lost in his lectures further his notes are not exactly the best to study from but i know he means the best
8842,Allan R  Baer,funny guy tries to make class enjoyable but really his exam questions are much more tricky than one would anticipate just from going to lectures pretty good at explaining things though and uses iclicker questions similiar in format not difficultywise to those found on exams
8843,Allan R  Baer,one of my favourite professors in years of university grills you like crazy but to make you a better nurse and ensure you provide excellent and knowledgible care to your patients excellent course great prof will always remember the striking difference between ionized and unionized molecules
8844,Allan R  Baer,definitely an acquired taste overall one of my favourite professors in years of university grills you like crazy but to make you a better nurse and ensure you provide excellent and knowledgible care to your patients killer course great prof will always remember the striking difference between ionized and unionized molecules
8845,Allan R  Baer,definitely a prof who cares about the students consults with us about extra tutorial times etc notes can be confusing but reading the textbook helps a lot seems like a good guy who loves what he does
8846,Allan R  Baer,baer is baer once acquired a taste for his very specific exam questions you understand what you will be asked in the future it seems like he loves what doing which is a plus you love him or you hate him
8847,Allan R  Baer,not a very good prof his notes are very confusing and all over the place definitely preferred the other profs plus his exam questions straight forward at all very tricky
8848,Allan R  Baer,the guy obviously knows and loves this material but as a person he was just annoying and not funny but overall possible to do well just study alot
8849,Allan R  Baer,very confusing boring lectures
8850,Allan R  Baer,some tricky exam and some lies you need to know numbers first question what is the osmolarity of the tubules of the kidney knew his stuff but too fast for someone who provide overheads hated the material but me
8851,Allan R  Baer,he was very nice and definitely helpful and his sense of humour really grows on you he was overbearing during the male reproductive unit but otherwise pretty good his exams are brutal though
8852,Allan R  Baer,appreciate his jokes so annoying definitely like his material either was counting down the days til new prof definitely knew his material though and was clear
8853,Allan R  Baer,he is very nice very helpful both outside and inside class he makes sure that everyone understood the material
8854,Allan R  Baer,he assumes a position of intelligence but lacks the acting skills to see it through tragically he is not aware of this
8855,Allan R  Baer,not as funny as dr easteal the class is super boring
8856,Allan R  Baer,no comments

8858,J.  Weathers,no comments
8859,John  Baer,the absolute worse would not recommend taking i know i think twice about taking him very ignorant rude and the worse if you have the option to take him
8860,John  Baer,taken both dr education psychology and online creativity courses education psychology is fairly hard but the online creativity course was easy very light homework and no tests a nice man who cares about his students and what teaching talks a little fast sometimes
8861,John  Baer,professor baer is a great teacher he enjoys lectures and tends to mumble or speak fast but always makes sure that you understand before moving on he enjoys teamwork and has teams work for points tests are all multiple choice but they are not super easy you definitely need to review notes before tests i would absolutely take him again
8862,John  Baer,loved professor baer lectures were a little boring but always tried to make it interesting and handson by including small groupwork gives lot of hand outs and you do not need to read all of them tests are difficult use quizlet and books to your advantage i would definitely take him again
8863,John  Baer,i worked hard but learned a lot hes a very nice man
8864,John  Baer,he is a nice man but his lectures are long and confusing you have to read the textbook otherwise you really know what is happening make sure to study really hard he really like for you to ask questions but as long as you study and try to pay attention you should be fine
8865,John  Baer,expects so much for an online credit course the articles were hard studies to read and write reviews on his feedback was a little harsh
8866,John  Baer,i really enjoyed dr class the choice he gives for exams is fair with different students teaching styles a very friendly guy when visiting in the field and very approachable after class or during office hours sometimes it was hard to hear him during class but he was willing to repeat any missed directions and speak up if asked to
8867,John  Baer,dr baer was great1 i loved the choice he gave when it came to which type of exam prefer to take also going to take his online class again this fall
8868,John  Baer,interesting wants everyone to succeed nice guy sort of grandfatherly seems to really like students and teaching
8869,John  Baer,i have no idea how anyone could give this guy a good rating his midterm and final were ridiculous he makes you look over words and essays when only fillins and essays would be on the test who can memorize that much information half the stuff he even go over in class
8870,John  Baer,anyone who says dr baer an awesome prrof obviously care enough to study hard dr baer is probably the est education professor at rider i wish he taught more classes because i would love to take him again
8871,John  Baer,such a nice and caring man he reminded me so much of a grandfather his tests were a little hard so make sure you study he gives you different options for tests so you can choose what works best for you his lectures were boring at times but you feel bad not paying attention since so nice i would definitely recommend him
8872,John  Baer,excellent teacher demanding but you learn alot
8873,John  Baer,hard but worth it if you want to learn to be a teacher
8874,John  Baer,a very nice man a really good class could get a little boring at times but overall i would recommend him as long as you read and do all the assignments you will be fine he is also a big disney and harry potter freak a great guy
8875,John  Baer,he is absolutely ridiclious he only grades you on tests but assigns written work that only counts as participation his lectures are boring and his grading is really unfair avoid him at all costs
8876,John  Baer,he is extremely intelligent and tries to be fun and entertaining with his mickey games and reviews for tests he can be kind of boring during lectures but what lectures boring he tries to balance it out with other fun activities you really learn a lot in his class you definitely need to work hard for good grades and be sure to study
8877,John  Baer,he was a caring and a great professor this professor went beyond the call of duty and gave us extra credit different test methods and was a professor who had great clarity and great knowledge of what he was teaching he really loves what he does and shows it in his teaching
8878,John  Baer,he was an excellent professor who was willing to help and gave us great tools on how to be successful teachers he was willing to go beyohd the extra mile to help us

8898,Charlene  Dalrymple,mrs dalrymple is a fantastic teacher and a great friend she is always enthusiastic about choir and singing and is a very hardworking professor being a singer herself directing the stonehill college choir oahs concert choir and show choir
8899,Tom  Harris,overly inflated ego pointless inclass discussions typos in his own book and extremely hard tests way too complex for collegelevel material horrible teacher
8900,Tom  Harris,dr harris is the most intelligent individual had the privilege of being in class with i learned more in com and com than any other class he is extremely friendly and extremely interesting i enjoyed going to class
8901,Tom  Harris,every class i have taken from this guy has been exactly the same he is the laziest teacher ever had super friendly and funny but constantly talks out of his
8902,Tom  Harris,he has got to be the best teacher i have ever had in my life he is extremely knowledgeable really easy to get along with and he grades extremely fair awsome guy and should be the teacher of the year
8903,Tom  Harris,what an awesome class what an awesome professor
8904,Tom  Harris,you read ok he doesnt lecture to much but still fun
8905,Tom  Harris,all you got to do is read
8906,Tom  Harris,all you have to do is read
8907,Tom  Harris,he knows his statistics tests are always multiple choice and reading is a must this guy will help you out with any real world info
8908,Doug  Zentz,very big ego if you patronize him and stroke his pride you will do well make him look good at the ashrae competition and he will help you if you challenge him he will lose his temper and his ears turn red smart but totally vain
8909,Doug  Zentz,his teaching methods are not normal he would yell at you and tell you that you did it wrong but on the other hand he would gladly help you correct your issues and understand what you were doing wrong he would even come in on saturdays to help his students learn and make sure projects were done on time great prof and helps with real world sits
8910,Doug  Zentz,this professor is very unprofessional he responds to every question as if the student is questioning his intelligence enjoys talking down to students uses the term creativity as a grading parameter to take points away for no apparent reason he also likes to use double negative statements on exams to purposefully confuse students
8911,Doug  Zentz,textbook narcissist that simply should not be a teacher hottempered drops fbombs and attacks and belittles students who ask questions you will have to find a way to let his racial comments cursing and talking to people like mentally handicapped not bother you just so you can pay attention in lecture very childish really
8912,Doug  Zentz,subjective and opinionated not a good teacher if every student in the whole program gets a terrible score on a lab assignment do you think it may have something to do with the clarity of the instructions never admits when he is wrong and he enjoys messing with your future by lowering your gpa hopefully you have a different teacher for
8913,Doug  Zentz,very knowledgeable but it seems like he care too much about students success he pics favorites in class so its helpful to be part of ashrae and other student groups not very approachable if you understand something and ask a question he will sometimes talk down to you watch for his bpm blinks per minute
8914,Doug  Zentz,stickler for silly stuff his heart is in the right place overall but he will waste your time on report format so make sure you follow the format he lays out to a t can be testee and short for not apparant reason very knowledgeable but a bore to listen too omg he can put you to sleep
8915,Doug  Zentz,great class loads of information so get organized lots of formulas so brush up on some algebra just do your work on time attend every class feel free atr ask for help zentz prefers people to get help ahead of time out of class you will learn alot in this course so dont get behind good luck
8916,Doug  Zentz,he is a horrible grader he hates to give out in anything he will purposefully mark you off big points for little problems in your assignments if you ask him questions he will get mad and start yelling on the plus side he seems to know the information
8917,Doug  Zentz,this class is very demanding but you can learn alot also gets reall annoying when professors think thier way is better than anything else you have ever learned and he needs to realize not everyone sees the world the same as him
8918,Doug  Zentz,good but demands you work to get a good grade
8919,Doug  Zentz,get organized and stay organized very good instructor very knowledgable assignments pile up quick but there is always plenty of lead time procrastinate and you will burn very demanding instructor but hard work is acknowledged and rewarded opportunities are provided for extra credit.good luck
8920,Doug  Zentz,know what all of this business about easy grading is he is the most critical grader i have ever seen way too much stuff to do in the class he piled everything on at the end it is not a good class and he is not a fair teacher
8921,Doug  Zentz,homework labs and other work not handed back very quickly can be a some days and always thinks everything he does is the right way
8922,Doug  Zentz,this is a class with a lot of formulas involved stay on top of your work and get behind or you will never catch up
8923,Doug  Zentz,great teacher he really knows what he is talking about he cares about his students success and their future he just wants everyone to leave the hvac program knowing what they need to know
8924,Doug  Zentz,no comments
8925,Doug  Zentz,easy grader but lots of notes and gives too much information
8926,Doug  Zentz,great guy
8927,Doug  Zentz,new teacher can tell he has never taught before needs to slow down a lot pretty easy grader though
8928,Mary  Curtner Smith,agree you must read because she asks questions on the test about information not in the lecture but she also asks about information in the lecture material interesting class i learned a lot attendance not mandatory but you can get rewarded for good attendance
8929,Mary  Curtner Smith,avoid at all cost she lectures the entire class time and the majority of what she says even what will be on the test she talks more about her personal life and personal opinions than the material that we actually need to know her test are tough and without the book you will have no idea what is going on this class is miserable
8930,Mary  Curtner Smith,go to class at the end of the semester she told us she reserved the right to drop you a letter grade for skipping class
8931,Mary  Curtner Smith,my favorite class with my favorite professor i like her teaching style she tells lots of funny stories that relate to the class and she really cares about her students
8932,Mary  Curtner Smith,the test are difficult the instructor discuss anything that will really prepare you for the test she talks constantly about irrelevant topics this is the first hd class ever had that was this difficult when it be the information is not hard but you have to read in order to do well do not expect to learn in class
8933,Mary  Curtner Smith,i really enjoyed her class she knows what she is talking about i did not take any tests in her class it was all based on summaries basically put in some effort and go to class i definitely think she will help the student if she knows them and they show effort
8934,Mary  Curtner Smith,this was a great course the exams were hard they are pick only one pick a c pick pick all of the above none of the above extremely tricky know your stuff in this class she gives many personal anecdotes in her lectures to bring the points home very impressive
8935,Mary  Curtner Smith,i had dr curtnersmith for hd parent and family development last fall it was my favorite class we learned so much and the stories she tells about her family relate to what she is teaching i loved this class and will use the information i learned when i become a parent
8936,Mary  Curtner Smith,i had her for an online class this summer and the only grades i received before the class was over were the test grades which are generated automatically she made you have the tests proctored which was just a pain she was slow at responding to emails too which is very important for an online class expect to know your grades
8937,Mary  Curtner Smith,i took her in the may summer semester and did not receive a grade on a paper or anything until august you never know what your grade is or where you stand not to mention she asks questions on tests youve never heard talks too much about her own life and not the course material
8938,Mary  Curtner Smith,you might as well throw out the syllabus because she spent so much time talking about her life that we made it through about the first four lectures obviously intelligent but she never stays on topic so you learn anything she covers nothing from the book but expects you to know it her actual words and tests very very hard
8939,Mary  Curtner Smith,she is an ok teacher her class seems very long and she talks wayy too much about her family most of which has nothing to do with the material we are covering in class her tests come from power points that you must be in class to get and you also have to read alot in your text book she loves to talk and shows alot of movies
8940,Mary  Curtner Smith,i had dr curtnersmith for and now for she is very nice and helpful but her classes are extremely time consuming they should definitely count more than credit hours she knows her stuff though and you will definitely learn from her
8941,Mary  Curtner Smith,i learned a ton of useful info in this class and found it really interesting her examples help you remember the information and the stuff you learn actually applies to real life very helpful professor
8942,Mary  Curtner Smith,hard tests she was crazy about attendance and then at the end of the semester it count against you if you were there or not awful class
8943,Mary  Curtner Smith,dr curtner smith is an intelligent woman but i did not like her as a professor she is very confusing as far as assignments and test material goes and is not an effective communicator at all she talks about her family for of class time and hardly gives any useful information in way of tests etc her class is not easy
8944,Mary  Curtner Smith,i dread going to this class ms curtner smith is an annoying communicator by the way she stutters through statements and says um alot she tends to teach more towards those with psychology backgrounds if you do not have one then you probably wont know what she is talking about and she explain it either very boring teacher do not take
8945,Mary  Curtner Smith,very hard and dread going to this class every single day it takes her a week to post grades and all the tests are scantron do not take this class if you have to the class is miserable and i know anyone who likes going to it she always goes off subject and keeps you the full time awful class and awful teacher
8946,Mary  Curtner Smith,i learned so much in her classes so helpful outside of class kept in touch since i had her a few years ago and helped me out alot i do agree that all about attachment parenting
8947,Mary  Curtner Smith,she is a very nice person and she is very knowledgable in the field i liked when she lectured and gave us notes but she did not really talk about anything in the book because we were expected to do that on our own but the book is awful dont wait to read until the last min
8948,Scott  Hancock,while i do find that college life explicitly involves freedom of expression i do not think professor encouragement of vulgarity among students outside of class is appropriate or professional glad i transferred to penn state
8949,Scott  Hancock,you will learn a lot
8950,Scott  Hancock,my boy great teacher
8951,Scott  Hancock,prof hancock is one of the best professors at gburg super helpful his class was interesting and engaging and pretty funny he makes you read a lot but totally worth it obvious that he loves what he teaches and cares about his students well the ones that pay attention oh and his page papers are the best
8952,Scott  Hancock,lost assigments lots of pop quizes arbitary participation garde difficult to deal with missed first class of the semester
8953,Scott  Hancock,one of my favorite professors i recommend him to all history majors and non
8954,Scott  Hancock,a good thing fys is no longer being offered because it was awful he was so unclear and never taught it was like he even care he worked with a professor that he hated
8955,Scott  Hancock,loved the class and gained a wealth of knowledge sad that there more professors on this campus like him
8956,Scott  Hancock,he was such an amazing professor i learned soo much from his classes he is in touch with our generation and a lot of fun i thought he was cute too he is an amazingly smart historian who values discussion in class
8957,Scott  Hancock,hes a samrt dude who learns from the kids in class as he teaches them in touch with kids our age knows whatsup
8958,Scott  Hancock,no comments
8959,Scott  Hancock,hands down the most serious and hardworking profs around a machine smart as a whip but gives off the distinct sense of a man learning with you young hip complex a keen eye for nuance and smart enough to show you history has motives gb
8960,Raymond  Wolf,i generally love all my teachers because i check them on here this teacher however was extremely inappropriate he made jokes about handicapped kids the first day he spent at least two months looking at uncovered people mostly women and even admitted to going to an adult site for some of his material take again
8961,Raymond  Wolf,take this professor if you get the chance this course is an easy a and at the same time you really learn a lot this professor teaches in a way of his own and it is a course that i will never forget i drove from pensacola beach to milton just to take this class and it was worth every mile professor wolf loves his job and it shows
8962,Raymond  Wolf,dr wolf is the best teacher i have had this semester at psc his lectures are always so interesting he encourages you to be bold say what you feel and have an opinion he is so and awesome i will take him whenever i can in my other classes buy a book the class is mostly just class discussions enjoy
8963,Raymond  Wolf,i took contemporary literature with him and say it was very thoughtprovoking honestly never knew what topics we were going to cover in class but the debates and subjects we went over were entertaining keep an open mind in his be too sensitive to some of the things he brings up overall very interesting class
8964,Raymond  Wolf,best instructor i have ever had the privilege to sit in a classroom with i leave the country for the next three years and one of the things im doing my last two days in america is sitting in on his class take him if you can
8965,Raymond  Wolf,dr wolf is the bomb he just says stuff to see if he can get a rise out of students and open their minds uto alternate ways of thinking
8966,Raymond  Wolf,wolfe is the easiest teacher in the world fun class learn a lot but very easy just come to class and dont buy a book
8967,Raymond  Wolf,amazing teacher i believe his goal is to open your eyes and teach you how to want to learn rather than making you know unimportant dates and names but rather the reason behind things be at class listen participate and enjoy
8968,Raymond  Wolf,definitely an eye opener need to be open minded highly recommend to take his class he loves to hear students thoughts

8971,Raymond  Wolf,hes a very funny teacher very humerous but hes a great teacher he gets to the point and as long as you pay attention easy a he does help you out some but you have to attend class if you miss to many days you will be dropped out
8972,Raymond  Wolf,awesome and crazy he will say anything easy a i think we only had one test besides the final just come to class you have to write a page journal but it is very easy because it can be about anything and i mean anything such as the pizza you at last night very caring personality likes to talk about hot dogs and doughnuts
8973,Raymond  Wolf,dr wolf is hilarious you have to take him unless you are easily offended he says anything and does anything he makes you keep a journal but besides that done any literature lol read one story so far
8974,Raymond  Wolf,doctor wolf really is an amazing professor force his opinions upon you makes you write a journal but very easy uses powerpoint for the material never uses the book he likes participation very funny i enjoy going to his class has no shame at all pretty descriptive haha but a very good class i recommend taking it
8975,Raymond  Wolf,dr wolf is the best teacher i have ever taken he is eccentric and well educated he wants people to question the norm the only professor so far to teach and respect me as an adult if you are not open minded do not take this class take a
8976,Raymond  Wolf,evil very inappropriate
8977,Raymond  Wolf,really good guy dont go into this class talking and acting like an idiot he will make you do stuff like come to the front of the class or make fun of you this class is great though very very very knowledgable you will learn so much if you pay attention i recommend this teacher hes a funny guy

8989,Tom  Barker,best instructor ever i loved his biker gangs class he knows his stuff got me really interested in this stuff
8990,Tom  Barker,maybe it was the subject matter biker gangs but i really liked this class my hand still hurts from all the notes but in the end he decided not to give a test most of the videos killed me and there were a lot of them but dr comments during them made me wake up occasionally entire grade was based on a book review and attendance
8991,Tom  Barker,the guys is fantastic really looking forward to his biker gangs class

8995,Tom  Barker,had i had this instructor prior to my english classes i would have done better on my papers
8996,Tom  Barker,his class can be very stressful but he will work extensively with you
8997,Chuck  Fields,if you dont pass with an a in this class then you did something wrong only thing you do all year is lectures and there are test if you get an a on the first two then you dont have to take the final test he gives you the test as a study guide literally hands you the exact test just look over notes and power points
8998,Chuck  Fields,very laid back and cancels class frequently weekly papers are easy and no exams class that bad when you have it
8999,Chuck  Fields,chuck is a great professor he frequently leaves the country so classes are sparse and his grading sometimes can be questionable if you do the assignments and answer the questions get an a with no questions asked a very respectable man and probably one of the nicest people ever meet
9000,Chuck  Fields,took chuck for my and a winter course to finland he is an awesome professor grades fairly and cancels class often if you get the chance take the crime and justice in scandinavia with him you will love it
9001,Chuck  Fields,easy class just take notes and be fine tests are usually opinion questions mostly textbook not mandatory but it helps
9002,Chuck  Fields,dr fields does lecture a lot but he tells stories to go along with it to keep your interest there are almost no assignments in this class but the tests are pretty tough even though there are only tests including the final they are pretty much your entire grade the textbook mandatory but it will help
9003,Chuck  Fields,do not take his drugs society class idk if the other reviewers were high when they wrote their review but he is a very difficult professor his final and midterm were outrageously hard if you miss more than time he was start taking off letter grades he also tells stories the entire class and very hard to stay awake
9004,Chuck  Fields,i loved the class he keeps it interesting and tells hilarious stories he never uses the textbook in class or gives out assignments if you listen and read the chapters plus go over powerpoints you should be fine
9005,Chuck  Fields,i personally like him very much his class is so boring i focus at all and pretended to throw up two different times just so i could leave if his midterm take home i would have gotten a because he teach page paper presentation midterm final those are your grades screw any up
9006,Chuck  Fields,awesome cancels class a lot take home midterm optional final
9007,Chuck  Fields,chuck fields is an awesome teacher he will always keep your attention by his diverse stories that he shares he does take attendance and does give somewhat difficult tests make sure to read in the textbook for the test overall loved the class
9008,Chuck  Fields,awesome
9009,Chuck  Fields,chuck fields is a very good professor to take for drugs class very knowledgeable on illicit drugs and their history two short answer exams and short reaction papers to movies you will watch in class focuses mainly on effects of drugs and also lots of history about government propaganda and media scares that have led to drug criminalization
9010,Chuck  Fields,dr fields is the man come to class and participate and you will do fine i recommend this teacher to anyone beginning the criminal justice program
9011,Chuck  Fields,good teacher wonderful person i always had his drug class
9012,Chuck  Fields,awesome teacher awesome guy if you get the chance take him for any class even if its not a crj
9013,Chuck  Fields,he is an ok teacher but needs an attitude ajustment
9014,Chuck  Fields,excellent teacher highly reccommended he outlines everything that is on the
9015,Chuck  Fields,an awesome teacher who keeps you engaged in conversation you rarely have homework just make sure you go to class
9016,Chuck  Fields,he makes every class enjoyable his stories and examples help me stay awake for his class as long as you go to class you are more likely to pass
9017,Derek  Paulsen,class is fine all notes on his website very clear about class information very few test really easy just review notes and your fine he is a great teacher but if you have no sense of humor and like cussing or jokes take him but i find him to be just fine i would recommend taking him for any class i am again next semester
9018,Derek  Paulsen,easy and informative classes just keep up with the notes he comes off as extremely pompous which he can be but for the most part he is alright
9019,Derek  Paulsen,great teacher there are no suprising or difficulty to the test he is a smart ass but thats what makes him cool take a joke you sensitive losers the information is up front and easy to learn i reccomend for a fair and easy a
9020,Derek  Paulsen,he is a pompous he is very rude try to avoid taking him if you can
9021,Derek  Paulsen,we did nothing but take notes and he flipped through the overhead notes so fast few got them down tests based on notes his basic level class had more work than advanced courses the only save from notes was the current events first thing of class which we learned to prolong as much as possible
9022,Derek  Paulsen,funny bit of a smart though which can make him hard to approach worth taking
9023,Derek  Paulsen,this is what a good college prof should be like personable but professional true you have to study for his tests hardcore but no surprise as to on it i appreciate that hilarious in class and very approachable
9024,Derek  Paulsen,do a good job letting students know what he expected on exams
9025,Derek  Paulsen,this prof is full of himself his class was boring and snubs students thinks hot but really not has an attitude that keeps us from asking questions all about him after all
9026,Derek  Paulsen,his class is very boring and learning nothing i learned in the past he never answers questions after class or even during class he lectures the whole time and his attitude changes when a special person is in the class
9027,Derek  Paulsen,cute babe
9028,Derek  Paulsen,dr paulsen is a very easy to talk to with a great sense of humor the course itself was not that great but i liked dr paulsen a lot
9029,Derek  Paulsen,dr paulsen he is a great and funny teacher he is easy to talk with has a great sense of humor
9030,Glenda  Williams,i took this class during the summer and it was a breeze there are three tests and a cumulative final dr williams is funny enthusiastic and always has a smile on her face she gave us fifteen minute breaks between lecture and film presentations and allowed us to eat during the films if looking to knock out a fine arts credit take her
9031,Glenda  Williams,excellent teacher very chill many days were just casual discussions but always interesting easy a as long as you come to class and pay attention
9032,Glenda  Williams,dr williams is great i had no desire to take a film class but needed the fa credit it turned out to be a good class it was a summer class and it was a lot to cover but it was surprisingly easy dr williams was very friendly personable and helpful if you can take her i would highly recommend you do so

9034,Glenda  Williams,this was a pretty easy class and dr williams did a good job teaching it our class specifically had a really humorous dynamic and i enjoyed going to this class more than any other class my only complaint is that i wish dr williams gave more specific feedback on our ad writing assignments but as implied this was a very course
9035,Glenda  Williams,dr williams is extremely helpful and a fantastic professor she has great guest speakers from the professional world and has wonderful contacts in the entertainment industry the most fantastic bonus is that she is so hot you going to find a better looking professor

9045,Glenda  Williams,glenda williams is an adviser for the tcf department she is not in on mondays and fridays which is terrible even during registration she will be out of her office on those days tcf department is severely slacking with this
9046,Glenda  Williams,one of the best

9058,Anne  Ramirez,shes horrible hands down take her class
9059,Anne  Ramirez,teacher very hard
9060,Anne  Ramirez,awful do not take her class so hard to understand and never stays on track with anything worst teacher i have every had
9061,Anne  Ramirez,this is the most unorganized teacher i ever had english is my favorite subject i have never struggled with writing before until this class she knows her facts but has no idea how to teach she is not helpful and soo hard to understand the whole class is way behind and we do not even go by the sylabuss she does not stay on track with anythin
9062,Anne  Ramirez,awful do not take her as a professor the most unorganized professor i have had never had any trouble in an english course and i am beyond lost this semester neumann has got to do something to fix this problem after looking at previous comments it has been going on for a long time
9063,Anne  Ramirez,this woman is awful i have liked every teacher i have had at neumann except for her she is rude and unwilling to help and she makes no sense whatsoever the work is hard and she has no desire to help you through the class tried numerous times bottom line stay away from her classes if you can
9064,Anne  Ramirez,if you can help it do not take her english class she treats it like more that just a core class way too much work for a gen ed and rude when i wrote a good paper she asked me if it was my own basically did i plagiarize avoid class at all costs
9065,Anne  Ramirez,without a doubt the absolute worst teacher in neumann college you cant understand her and she makes absolutely no sense
9066,Anne  Ramirez,the worst teacher at neumann could not understand her hand writing not very organized at one point in the semester she lost my classes papers can never understand what she is saying and probably the worst speaking voice of any teacher iv ever had
9067,Anne  Ramirez,i dropped the class half way through the semester absolutely horrible do not take her

9074,Robert  Rafalko,he went against unh handbook guidelines by giving out personal information of students to non students
9075,Robert  Rafalko,great teacher makes class interesting and challenges students to argue their points fun class
9076,Robert  Rafalko,give yourself your own grade interesting method of grading but effective class was a roundtable discussion and it is a definate break from the constant lectures i highly recommend him bring your cup of coffee and enjoy
9077,Robert  Rafalko,best and easiest class ever taken
9078,Robert  Rafalko,dumb but thinks he is smart really know what he believes in
9079,Robert  Rafalko,likes to tell people they are misguided because they disagree with his view
9080,Robert  Rafalko,he is open to hearing any point of view but if there is what he feels is a right one he will push you towards it he has a story or the like to go with every topic which is good and makes it easier to learn and is not homophobic or pushes christiany
9081,Robert  Rafalko,his grading method is very different but it is very effective it is a lot of work to get the grade you want but there are no grades so there as much pressure i would suggest taking his class
9082,Robert  Rafalko,horrible
9083,Robert  Rafalko,no comments
9084,Robert  Rafalko,in his ethics class he really pushes peoples buttons to spur discussion he is quite conservatice politicaly and occasionaly comes off as homophobic sometimes it seems as though he is pushing christianity onto the class overall his class is good
9085,Robert  Rafalko,very good class interesting
9086,Robert  Rafalko,his method of grading is different but effective he is informative and gets off topic easily which is partially good if you do the work you are good for the semester
9087,Robert  Rafalko,no comments
9088,Kazim  Ruhi,ruhi can be intimidating when it comes to asking questions in class it seems like he gets frustrated for you needing clarification this class would have been a lot harder if i had not taken ap stats in high school although the examples he gives in class give a good insight to the tests he always gives a formula sheet too
9089,Kazim  Ruhi,teacher is passionate about what he teaches very thorough and explains what is expected for the exams assignments and homework
9090,Kazim  Ruhi,smart but rude to his students very bad at explaining the concepts to students ask him for help act like wasting his time if another option take another teacher spend hours reading the textbook and watching youtube trying to teach yourself
9091,Kazim  Ruhi,seems to understand what he is doing but is easily the worst teacher had at communicating what he is talking about to students his lack of proficiency in english can be a challenge at times although accent is clear can be incredibly rude at times calling out students for not knowing answers
9092,Kazim  Ruhi,intelligent but bad at explaining material expect to teach yourself office hours always packed he accuses you of skipping class and looks at you like your an idiot when you ask questions to clarify his confusing lectures only professor seen yell at a student or call them a liar a is possible b is likely c is common drop rate is high
9093,Kazim  Ruhi,confuses me gives good examples i learn better from examples on hw then teacher himself
9094,Kazim  Ruhi,this is a difficult subject but ruhi does a good job of explaining the material exams are tough but they are manageable discussions are graded he does have an accent but is definitely understandable i would recommend this professor
9095,Kazim  Ruhi,ruhi is very nice and helpful but has quite an accent he makes the exams easy enough this class was business statistics i took ap statistics in high school so it kinda helped with acing the class and the exams he posts all his notes online i only looked through the book online if i doubted anything on his slides i recommend him
9096,Kazim  Ruhi,bad
9097,Kazim  Ruhi,although this class is extremely tough prof ruhi works hard to teach his students well his grading is very fair and he always responds to emails promptly even on the weekends as long as you attend lectures you can do well in the course
9098,Kazim  Ruhi,awesome teacher he gave plenty of examples and the class material built on itself very well provided review times before tests i never did the homework but had no problems i am a bit of a mathoriented guy sat fwiw only downside is you got to walk to van munching on the outskirts of campus
9099,Kazim  Ruhi,one of those classes that either clicks or a nice guy whose willing to repeat things to you over and over and his are straighforward class mandatory but he gives major hints on what to expect on tests and exams as well as help the homework very possible a
9100,Kazim  Ruhi,one of the best professor i ever had to learn from
9101,Kazim  Ruhi,professor ruhi was one of the best teachers ever had he was always so helpful and nice dr ruhi really wants his students to learn the material
9102,Kazim  Ruhi,a great teacher he really does want students to do well he has an accent but honestly i can understand him better than any math teacher ever had very logical listen to his advice and do the hw
9103,Kazim  Ruhi,one of the best math teachers ever had he runs through the problems in a logical order and the homework is really similar to the exams as long as you do the homework problems the exams and quizzes will be really easy
9104,Kazim  Ruhi,no comments
9105,Kazim  Ruhi,the best he gives quizzes midterm final and two individual projects exams are not that hard as long as you study and do exactly what he tells you to do he is an awesome teacher quizzes will give you an idea what real exams look like take his class you will have a great semester wit him
9106,Kazim  Ruhi,super nice guy who will do everything in his power to help you do well in class definitely recommend him if you have the chance to take his class

9114,Michael D  Kawaja,this guy knows smart seems to let you know too
9115,Michael D  Kawaja,if important he says it three times this can be annoying
9116,Michael D  Kawaja,very clear on his expectations but not overly nice
9117,Barbara  Kimmelman,okay so all being way too hard on her yeah she assigns a lot of reading but this is college supposed to be learning not getting grades for nothing she has intriguing class discussions grades fairly gives helpful feedback and she really knows her stuff
9118,Barbara  Kimmelman,i enjoyed this class she grades you on your understanding of the material and you will actually learn history she cares about the experiences of the people in the past and will help if you ask there are no tests she does assign a lot of readings but you just have to skim them you just need a basic understanding of american history
9119,Barbara  Kimmelman,do not take this professor if you want to pass any of your other classes you should not take her she is so unclear and assigns so much work if you ask a dumb question she laughs at you thinks everyone is stupid such a hard grader tried to give benefit of the doubt but she is horrible take my word
9120,Barbara  Kimmelman,do not take this professor if you want to pass any of your other classes you should not take her she is so unclear and assigns so much work if you ask a dumb question she laughs at you thinks everyone is stupid such a hard grader tried to give benefit of the doubt but she is horrible take my word
9121,Barbara  Kimmelman,worst teacher ever grading comments make no sense classes boring very hard especially when it comes to grading papers assigned
9122,Barbara  Kimmelman,horrible if you can change professors then do it she is so boring she assigns pages of reading a night she is super snobby and if you answer something incorrectly she basically laughs in your face attendance necessary but if you want to do good then read all of the assigned readings
9123,Barbara  Kimmelman,worst class ever first week you learn you dont need to read the worthless textbooks grades papers like she is a english teacher has nothing to do with my major teaching method is as dry as dirt pages of dry reading per night papers do yourself a favor and get out of that class worry about design
9124,Barbara  Kimmelman,professor gives a lot of work pages to read by next class you will be given six during the semester to make sure you are doing the reading assignments page research paper will be required and for exam you will be ask to complete page paper with many restrictions take only one class for the semester get an a
9125,Barbara  Kimmelman,way way way too much work completely unneccessary amount of work considering it has nothing to do with major and distracts you from the classes and assignments that matter absolutely terrible
9126,Barbara  Kimmelman,she is a very nice lady in general and she will help you out but this is the most boring class ever and its a lot of reading due in every class
9127,Barbara  Kimmelman,hard work a little hard to get used to her teaching stlye at first once you get it though it gets easier not an easy class
9128,Barbara  Kimmelman,kimmelman is out of her damn mind if you say exactly what she wants to hear your wrong impossible to get an a rude and whoever reccomends her is out of their mind as well acts as if its the most important class when it is not do not take her
9129,Barbara  Kimmelman,seems like a nice laidback professor then you get your first paper back and realize that the same writing abilities that have gotten you by with since middle school get you a in her class very disorganized and her class is pretty much pointless to go to contemp sucks enough without having the the paper nazi as a professor
9130,Barbara  Kimmelman,thumbs down on the group project but she wants to help her lectures are a bit all over the place but we always had great class discussions reccommend her just know you have to get used to her style
9131,Barbara  Kimmelman,this class was such a waste of time i rarely ever went to it she rambled on in class about god knows what and her papers were impossible to write cause they never made any sense she grades terrible and the class is so boring i really really recommend taking her
9132,Barbara  Kimmelman,shes very helpful and commited to the subject very knowledgeable keep up with the readings and your bound to get a good grade simple quizzes to keep your grade up and papers during the course i would recommend this teacher to anyone looking for a fun interesting history class
9133,Barbara  Kimmelman,unrealistic expectations snobby ivy league grad rude overbearing ignorant i can go on and basically she makes up her own criteria for citations and writing papers i hate this class and professor i warned you never ever take her contemp sucks to begin with but kimmelman made it horrible
9134,Barbara  Kimmelman,ok so this was a real interesting and comical class loud and hyper but her notes are sscrambled and hard to understand pretty much do the readings and participate in class n pass
9135,Barbara  Kimmelman,loud boisterous overbearing intimidating unorganized and masculine come to mind when thinking of kimmelman be prepared for a lot of reading and note taking to be up to speed if you talk to her on a one on one basis shes great and will be accomodating but otherwise in class she is not too helpful and willing to stop or slow down to explain any concepts best bet is to have her email address on hand if you are confused about anything
9136,Barbara  Kimmelman,i remember one of the kids that was working at the orientation recommending kimmelman and this class glass eyed and bushy tailed i signed up and regretted it for weeks you understand her writing graded harder than any other prof that i had and care about what her students thought becuase she was writing a damn book

9145,Michael  Martone,just wow i wish that i could take his class for the rest of my college career we explored campus talked about everything and you really get to bond with everyone in class if you show up you get an he wants to inspire you to get what you want out of the class which makes most people actually care about the assignments take this class
9146,Michael  Martone,a hour class that meets once a week it can seem long at first but take him if you can i simply loved him and his classes they were always a nice break from the heavy course work of my major he requires nothing except to engage in class when there attendance was never required but everyone usually showed up because we loved him
9147,Michael  Martone,once upon a time there was a professor named michael martone one day he got a motley class full of en students some dropped and some stayed and those that stayed had a glorious time in his kingdom once the semester was over the students and their good grades lived happily ever after take him if you have the opportunity the end
9148,Michael  Martone,he really loves writing and gets really into talking about it and telling stories a very interesting and great person to meet the class is mostly discussion with some creative writing assignments all do at the end of the this class if you are interested in learning alot about creative writing and what it means to you
9149,Michael  Martone,mikey is the man not only is he funny and insightful he has a sincere love of the written word and a commitment to his students he sees the indefinite possibilities of each student an amazing teacher and a wonderful person
9150,Leah  Hutchison,nice lady quite a bit of reading assignments and quizzes but the quizzes really on the text in the book but on the short stories that you try to skip over she gives a lot of writing assignments and is a tough grader do fine if you go to class read the short stories and write your papers well before they are due
9151,Leah  Hutchison,leah is pretty cool for starters really cute so that helps she is very helpful and smart i really enjoyed her class and can recommend her to anyone
9152,Leah  Hutchison,chili peppers ought to tell you something
9153,Leah  Hutchison,she was a very fair teacher expect her class to be super easy just because she is pretty expect to do well if you retain what read she is very specific about what will be on the papers and is very easy to talk to if confused no reason why you do well if you put forth effort
9154,Leah  Hutchison,one of the fairest teachers ever had always explains what she wants out of you she has a great personality and she is very beautiful i reccommend her to anyone her class is intersting
9155,Leah  Hutchison,she is a very good teacher unlike some teachers she teaches you how to write and spend a whole class period talking about nothing she is there to help she even fuss if no one goes to her office to get help she grade hard at all i got a b in the class
9156,Leah  Hutchison,she had a quirky personality but in a good way not what i expected from her appearance or from someone so young let her looks fool you very intelligent expect a good grade for mediocre work either i advise planning your papers ahead of time a bit monotone but otherwise a good teacher and pretty down to earth person
9157,Leah  Hutchison,a very tough grader in regards to grammar she is enjoyable though
9158,Leah  Hutchison,i was hoping this teacher would be easy on grammar but you dont get off easy i found her to be a hard grader even tho she is nice enuff
9159,Leah  Hutchison,she is a very good teacher easy if you do the work she harsh on grading and responds to emails quickly take her super early in the morning her voice will put you to sleep her attempts at being funny are appreciated
9160,Leah  Hutchison,i fell in love with her she is an extremely helpful teacher and an easy grader too just pay attention in class and do your work pass with flying colors no problem
9161,Leah  Hutchison,she is a great teacher the material was at times hard but she was very clear about the works we studied she knew a lot about the works and was very helpful make sure to always read the assignments and start ealry on papers very good teacher
9162,Leah  Hutchison,very pretty hard to concentrate good teacher
9163,Leah  Hutchison,i have her now for british lit the material isnt always intresting but it is still a fun class and i am doing okay in there but u do have study
9164,Leah  Hutchison,she is kind of hard but you can make a b if you do all the assignments when writting a paper start on it early and you will do good in her class
9165,Leah  Hutchison,i took her in summer bridge also but she is a great teacher just keep up with your syllabus and ask questions if you are unsure i did it and i got an a
9166,Leah  Hutchison,she was a good and funny teacher i took her for a summer bridge program this past summer and the class was good she grades firm on your papers though but i guess it is for your own good but overall the class was okay
9167,Leah  Hutchison,she was a great professor but to bad she does not teach anymore she is very hot and smart she always has something intresting to say great teacher
9168,Leah  Hutchison,she was funny and easy going she was always very prompt about answering emails just make sure you read your syllabus and do your assignments she give you an a but not that hard to earn one
9169,Leah  Hutchison,she is a pretty good teacher and is very fair although that may hurt some people if you do the work not going to do well show up for class and read the material and do fine essays are kinda difficult
9170,B.R.  Smith,had him ago and i still remember how awful he was worst prof ive had during my career at central.most unfriendly teacher youll ever meet not are atrocious.the brutality of his teaching methods cannot even be measured only prof that held class past the day before assigned work to make sure we skip
9171,B.R.  Smith,never having take b.r class before i didnt know what to expect he seemed to know what he was talking about but never assigned reading from the text dont take a film class about a director that you dont really like
9172,B.R.  Smith,he was sorta monotone and boring pretty easy class though only real grades exams and a paper watch movies in class then listen to him lecture
9173,B.R.  Smith,very boring teacher and he very friendly was kind of a jerk to me when i had to miss two classes and i had doctors notes for an excuse
9174,B.R.  Smith,mr smith is an extremely boring professor and his tests are impossible the test are on nothing that we learn in class and there is no way that anyway can do well in this class i highly recommend that you take this class unless you need it for your major
9175,B.R.  Smith,mr smith is clearly passionate about the subject he teaches he wants everyone to do well in his class and offers advice listen to it sometimes his sense of humor comes out and really funny
9176,B.R.  Smith,no comments
9177,B.R.  Smith,sad sad sad sad sad this guy know film from his ass he was trying to tell our class that john cassavetes directed baby for all of you who took and about the films complete idiots i hated the class because this guy has no knowledge of film i gone up there and taught the class better than he could
9178,B.R.  Smith,zz huh what what oh this is a credit hour class and a hour nap this class is absolutly pointless but required for majors and minors if you like mr feeny it may not be so bad
9179,B.R.  Smith,im withdrawaling from his class im so over it i tried its just not me if yer in to it and can stay awake for in the morning watchin the great train robbery then try it out but im outa here
9180,B.R.  Smith,a good guy and knows what talking about so you find him boring listen to what saying not hard if you pay attention and very open if you go and ask him for help caring unlike other profs in the dept that i mention plus i think hot and not even kidding
9181,B.R.  Smith,our nickname for b.r was the corpse because he was about dead i think if he smiled his face would crack the tests were the most awful obsurd things ever laid eyes on oh and pay someone five bucks to ask him what b.r stands for
9182,B.R.  Smith,terrible dont take even if there is no other class available i dont know anyone who got better than a c seriously people no one wants work that hard in a cinema class take dr j
9183,B.R.  Smith,very tough class not sure what you need to study but the book was unclear and hard to read s really did not need to be this tough he believes that you are in college and should know how to pick out what matters from the material and what
9184,B.R.  Smith,he makes question tests out of material for about questions everything bad said about him is true and if he choked during class i dont think anyone would help him
9185,B.R.  Smith,what you should know good guy but the stress of the job has gotten to him you must remember he is at that phd level which he expects you be there with him the tests are out of reach his microthemes are extremely worded in a way you cannot attempt to answer unless you have the time pass
9186,B.R.  Smith,b.r smith thinks that a percent average in his class is a good thing i dropped this class i had no idea my grade in in till about a week before drops he doesnt post stuff up on blackboard his tests are hard as hell his in class assignments averaged out of do not take this professor
9187,B.R.  Smith,horrible class and person enough said wait one more thing wiffed out
9188,B.R.  Smith,dont take this class trust me stressful
9189,B.R.  Smith,not that bad but his exams are nothing like what you study for at all he gives you a study guide with things that are not on the exam at all and the stuff he wants you to remember i do not recommend this class a big stressor and most likely to just scrape by
9190,Eugene  Cuevas,good as person but not as teacher very very hard if you are looking for an a you will never get it in this class do it in the essay i got after that he gave us revision essay so i improved my essay as per his suggestions and he gave me are you kidding me you have to be book author to receive an a in the essay hell no
9191,Eugene  Cuevas,i have a very good experience with him i took him online and he was not very helpful at all no matter how many times i emailed him he always treated me like my questions were dumb a science major so i took this class because i was required to i tried to get help from everyone i could think of for his assignments but it never helped
9192,Eugene  Cuevas,cuevas taught me how to write a college paper he was great with feedback very funny and really able to relate to the students he gives you a chance to revise your worst paper and earn points back very fair grader and really wants his students to do well would definitely recommend
9193,Eugene  Cuevas,great class with a great professor would highly recommend
9194,Eugene  Cuevas,cuevas was awesome he really helped expand my writing and improved critical reading and writing he will answer any and all questions you have and even encourages you to email whenever you have a question outside of class pretty funny and nerdy too and the essay topics are actually fun overall a cool class
9195,Eugene  Cuevas,just unless one of his favorites like you think you understand the assignment you could even meet with him about your ideas and be supportive and then you make a low grade because you apparently give him what he wanted
9196,Eugene  Cuevas,the discussions are interesting for papers always attend his office hours take notes in class and read the rubric times over i went from to an and a comment on how much he liked my paper
9197,Eugene  Cuevas,he is definitely the best professor i have had in the english department he is very helpful witty and funny his class to me is fairly easy as long as you read the assignment and follow his models for how you answer things also super easy to get along with and if you tell him something is not right fix it take him if you can
9198,Eugene  Cuevas,if you enjoy movies in any regard this class is for you mr cuevas is fantastically wellrounded in the world of cinema and will enlighten even the biggest movie buff he assigned two papers with clear outlines and three exams that he reviews for beforehand attend lectures because much of the exam derives from what he discusses in class
9199,Eugene  Cuevas,i took his eh101 class and he is very clear and concise as to what he wants your essay to be constructed as he is very helpful and although his teaching can get extremely boring it is helpful when you sit down and write your essay my writing has improved by taking his class
9200,Eugene  Cuevas,fantastic teacher always very willing to help out worry if your first essay has a rough grade once you learn what he looks for specifically then a breeze wait to take him for eh102 next semester super cool guy
9201,Eugene  Cuevas,cuevas is awesome he is so upbeat and loves to have discussions with his class he does grade somewhat hard but if you come to class take notes on the material participate in discussion etc then be fine take him if possible be a favorite class
9202,Eugene  Cuevas,online class read assignments and do work and you should do fine in this class not an easy a but if you put in the time and do the assignments it is
9203,Eugene  Cuevas,just do it
9204,Eugene  Cuevas,dude just dont hes annoying for the final group project i told him my group wasnt working well together and he sent all of us an angry email i really couldve cussed him out but i needed my grade but srsly just say no he looks like one of the angry beavers too that is the only thing that will get you through his class
9205,Eugene  Cuevas,not an easy a get me wrong this guy is very nice but he wants you to put alot of special effort into his class that means talking to him going to his office going to library etc when you write papers your grade drops dramatically for each minute mistake for instance a misplaced comma so beware
9206,Eugene  Cuevas,mr cuevas is a decent professor if you are looking to easily pass a literature class then take him because assuming you read make an a with little effort if an english major or someone interested in literature then be disappointed teaching aside a really nice guy
9207,Eugene  Cuevas,awesome guy but take him for univ if you want an easy a his tests were all essay or short answer i had to spend a lot of time studying and feel like i learned anything if willing to put in the work you can easily make an a he made the class interesting but i still felt like it was a waste of time
9208,Eugene  Cuevas,mr cuevas is a nice guy however i did not enjoy him much as a teacher he takes way too long to grade assignments and never answered any of my emails his class will challenge you and a lot of work so if you are looking for an easy a you might want to find someone else again aside from this i cannot reiterate how nice this guy is
9209,Eugene  Cuevas,i loved professor cuevas i will take him again he does expect you to try in his class but if you put in effort to the class he will see that and give you a grade to reflect that i have had teachers here that will not give you a good grade to be contrary but professor cuevas is always open to helping and to hearing new opinions take him
9210,Susan  Sailors,this was an online class but she did a very good job of keeping instructions clear i liked her and would take her again
9211,Susan  Sailors,if everyone is quiet when she asks questions there will be a surprise quiz read even if you understand because if you ask questions she will keep explaining in differnet ways until you get it do not skip the review day before a test if you do well go to office hours and ask questions nice if she sees you trying
9212,Susan  Sailors,feedback was good though i had to have tracking changes in word explained to me pretty good for an online class lots of reading but i expected that because of the subject i always got a fast response to my questions
9213,Susan  Sailors,i have anxiety issues and i was afraid of online classes ms sailors gave me her phone number and let me with issues during regular workday hours this helped me succeed in my very first online class there is a lot of reading but i found the book helpful and informative i believe i learned a great deal in this class
9214,Susan  Sailors,good teacher she gave clear explanations of mark ups on papers there is lots of reading and you pass the quizzes if you do not read you also need to pay attention to announcements and extra handouts there is stuff not in the book that you will lose points for if you read the stuff she posts
9215,Susan  Sailors,professor sailors is great all of her assignments are pretty easy and you can tell she knows the subject very well make sure to complete the assignments and do the discussion participation the quizzes come straight from the book take her if she is available
9216,Susan  Sailors,easy if you do the work pass
9217,Susan  Sailors,very easy and understand prof she will go over all things in class and provide any help you need and even extensions if you have a good reason take her no matter what
9218,Susan  Sailors,she was awsome and by far the easiest and best professor ive had at uab
9219,Susan  Sailors,she is a great proffesor if you come to class and listen you should be able to get an a she wears black all the time right before the test she will basically tell you what is on it just take good notes and you will do fine
9220,Susan  Sailors,ms sailors is very easy and helpful you have to go to class if you do not understand the stories you really do not have to read just come to class and take notes and you are bound to get an a or b but you have to study the notes of course for the exam
9221,Susan  Sailors,she is very good if you go to class and take notes and listen you should be able to get a a even if you do not understand old english she really goes over everything to where you can understand
9222,Susan  Sailors,a very helpful and informative professor
9223,Susan  Sailors,no comments
9224,Susan  Sailors,wow ms sailors is so hot and smart too she showed us american psycho in class it was so into the stuff into
9225,Mike  Morucci,avoid at all costs
9226,Mike  Morucci,you people are dumb this teacher is the worst guy ever he writes so small and gets mad if you ask him a question im never using this site again you dont know what your talking about
9227,Mike  Morucci,mr morucci is a great guy a little outspoken on politics but other than that a great teacher he explains things very clear and in detail he really helped me understand the material
9228,Mike  Morucci,very easy explains things well easy class
9229,Linda  Bobo,the class is because she knows how to teach and make everyhting good i like the way she teches i do not understand the rate below
9230,Linda  Bobo,this teacher is terrible she makes everything into a joke
9231,Linda  Bobo,i love linda bobo she is the best teacher i have ever had she is kind sweet and very beautiful just a wonderful teacher
9232,Linda  Bobo,the first aid class she is so helpful she loves her job and her support out of class makes her golden
9233,Linda  Bobo,a great teacher is always there to help you out great at answering questions very knowledgeable
9234,Linda  Bobo,no comments
9235,Vo  Liem,i understand why some people like him his lecture is very logic and helpful to understand materials his test is not bad at all as long as you study
9236,Vo  Liem,terrible you cant understand him and he even know how to work webassign or blackboard very thick accent with very poor english take him unless you want to teach yourself
9237,Vo  Liem,very good teacher soft spoken but takes amazing notes he is the best drawer ever for a math instructor his test are exactly like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test
9238,Vo  Liem,he has a thick accent and gives a lot of homework class was very challenging
9239,Vo  Liem,dr vo is the sweetest old man his lectures can be a little dull at times but they are incredibly informative and are indicative what his tests will be like gives study guides and practice tests for all tests including the final
9240,Vo  Liem,he was a really sweet and nice guy homework is really tough
9241,Vo  Liem,i have him for cal ii his tests are easy and always give extra point for every test would take him again
9242,Vo  Liem,calc with him at first it was hard to understand him trust me you get used to his accent give both online hw and hw he made up test is heavily based off the problems he made so if you can solve them quick ace his class
9243,Vo  Liem,not nearly as easy as expected had to teach myself the course material because he is not only hard to understand but also does not explain things well at all he provides old tests as study material but sneaks in several unexpected problems he is known for giving wrong answers in study guides without even realizing it take someone else
9244,Vo  Liem,a wonderful sweet man but he can be hard to understand at times his test are hard because the proofs are very specific but if you take detailed notes complete the homework and read the examples in the text book manageable
9245,Vo  Liem,i have him for calculus ii he would give extra points on any tests and expected hw every monday his accent will get better when you are used to it and try to sit at the front very lenient on partial credits he is quite funny sometime
9246,Vo  Liem,had for calculus ii sometimes can be difficult to understand but if you sit towards the front you should get it if i saw his name listed for another math course i would take him again in a heartbeat
9247,Vo  Liem,super nice guy who makes calc much easier the webassign homework is disproportionately harder than the examsif you can do the homework the exams will be a breeze but they too bad anyway go to class review his lecture slides on blackboard do the homework and know the study guides well and you will make an would recommend
9248,Vo  Liem,very sweet man if the type of person who needs their prof to explain everything in me your guy gives old tests to study for your exam takes attendance and if you miss more than two days you can replace your lowest test score with your final accent is not bad but you may want to sit close to him bc he speaks softly
9249,Vo  Liem,he is a good teacher and the tests are pretty easy because he gives you old exams to study there is a good amount of homework online and he takes attendance everyday he does have an accent but you get used to it and he writes everything he says in the online notes he gives you and on the board in class
9250,Vo  Liem,i really liked professor liem always happy and cracked me up during class his tests too easy but he puts very aggressive curves on all the tests the class ended up being easier than i expected
9251,Vo  Liem,he was extremely clear during lectures and made sure that we understood the material before moving on he seemed to genuinely care about his success there was also a built in curve with the tests
9252,Vo  Liem,he was pretty clear to understand and wanted everyone to succeed he posted last years tests and answers in order to help us review even though he gave some of the hardest webassign homework the tests were cake walks not even kidding he built points into each test and was huge on partial credit made calc a breeze
9253,Vo  Liem,vo is a really nice guy and you can tell he definitely cares about his students and how well he teaches he changed his teaching style halfway through the year to make his lectures better tests are similar to the review that he hands out but can be long
9254,Vo  Liem,really nice try to get use to his accent and you will see that he just asks you to be hardworking
9255,James  Nesta,has stop teaching since
9256,James  Nesta,very knowledgeable and mathematically sophisticated willing to help students as much as possible not always as well prepared as he should have been think he had personal problems tried to teach the class in a way so as to impart professional problem solving techniques
9257,Susan  Cole,unfair and manipulative
9258,Susan  Cole,no comments
9259,Susan  Cole,very knowledgable and approachable
9260,P  Nicoletto,after repeatidly taking this course i took this professor in the summer got an a he lectures from the moment class starts to a little over the class end time to take notes i used my macbook and found it much easier to follow his layout follow his layout study his notes in the layout he gives hrs a day his test come straight from notes
9261,P  Nicoletto,great professor his notes are very clear and organized if you study and understand the notes you will be perfectly fine he gives lots of examples and is super interesting he makes biology fun and helped me want to learn he wont give your grade have to earn it but he is fair take him always available for help and he cares
9262,P  Nicoletto,dr nicoletto is a wonderful professor however the exams and material can be very hard do not except the class to get handed to you you need to at least study hrs a day if not more i recommend taking this class in the summer because the grades are better and the material is fresh on your mind
9263,P  Nicoletto,dr nicoletto is an amazing professor i highly recommend him and would take him again he is inspirational and is always available to help you do have to show up to class because his tests are all from his lecture he posts on bb with illustrations but he post his notes must study daily but thats with any science class
9264,P  Nicoletto,this is the best and by far the most inspirational professor i have ever had the pleasure to take if you truly care about science you will love this class and this professor if you care and think it is ridiculous that a professor makes you study after taking this class you will either shape up or probably drop out of college best ever
9265,P  Nicoletto,hands down best professor do not isten to toerhs when they say he is a hard professor if you are there to learn and put the effort in you will succeed study study his notes the answers are there i promise he will teach you what you need to know and he is fair he will not give you copies of the notes so go to class
9266,P  Nicoletto,he is a great teacher but think he is just going to let you stroll through his class you have to study and go over his notes everyday his power points are not on black board but he does put the illustrations on there to help you remember information easier
9267,P  Nicoletto,nicoletto is the best professor ever he is not as hard as everyone says so be scared of him he is very helpful as long as you care about the class and want to learn attendance is not mandatory but you have to show up to pass you need the textbook very smart and interesting man take him
9268,P  Nicoletto,dr nicoletto is by far the best professor i have taken you have to study but come on it is a science class nobody said anything worth having in life comes easy
9269,P  Nicoletto,i absolutely love dr nicoletto his class is tough and there is a lot of material to learn but if you really want to learn take his class he is extremely smart and helpful he seems intimidating but he is actually a very nice man always making jokes this class is never boring take nicoletto especially if majoring in nursing
9270,P  Nicoletto,i took him for and it was hard as hell you have to study your butt off and it is very stressful he lectures every class for the whole period you dont really need the book the test are straight from the notes which are like pgs front and back every class and the test are hard overall good and he knows his stuff though
9271,P  Nicoletto,everything is from the notes you just have to know it or you fail really hard to play catch up in this class lectures all class and uses examples that are confusing outdated
9272,P  Nicoletto,i took nicoletto for tests are straight from the notes and hard as hell you have to know the material you take notes the entire class period attendance required but strongly advised if you want to pass he is fair and extremely helpful lectures are completely relevent to the course been one of my favorite professors
9273,P  Nicoletto,dr nicoletto is very nice his tests are totally from the notes if you study your ass off from those you will pass lewis as a lab teacher sucks though go for posey
9274,P  Nicoletto,you take notes the entire class period need the book his tests are straight forward but annoying becuase all blank so you pretty much have to memorize everything cool too much into evolution though
9275,P  Nicoletto,great instructor explains all the material clearly and with great detail the course material is very difficult there is no attendance req but if you want to do well in class miss class works well with students that are having a hard time take lewis for lab
9276,P  Nicoletto,nicoletto is by far my favorite professor at lamar his class as hard as people make it seem a soph level biology course and the material is just that if you know your stuff not hard take posey for lab the two of them are so helpful love them
9277,P  Nicoletto,he is a very great professor but very hard he makes the class very interesting if you have to take anatomy you should definitely take him for anatomy anatomy will be a breeze i love the class but have had to neglect my other classes to do good in his everything comes from the notes if you make note cards save them for the final
9278,P  Nicoletto,strict but fair
9279,P  Nicoletto,really really great professor he keeps things interesting and likes to gross the girls out if you talk text etc do his best to embarrass you if you want an easy a do not take this class if you want to learn this class is the best if you understand something work hard to get you to understand
9280,Betty  Given,the most caring teacher had
9281,Betty  Given,the best
9282,Betty  Given,she goes word by word from the book and your tests are only questions she assigns homework but never checks to see if you have done it
9283,Betty  Given,ungodly easy she taught from the book didnt check homework and the tests were questions multiple choice classes before tests were called study classes and we wouldnt have class at all i give her a
9284,Betty  Given,no comments
9285,Betty  Given,a really easy class until it comes to the tests she basically just teaches every single example in the book and bores you to death the tests are hard but as long as you study for a while beforehand do okay
9286,Betty  Given,no comments
9287,Betty  Given,no comments
9288,Betty  Given,very hard to follow she will write one thing on the board and say something totally different she did grade on a curve but i feel like i learned anything
9289,Betty  Given,sucks
9290,Betty  Given,although i hate math i took her because i heard she was easy well it a piece of cake but if you go every day she will curve the grades considerably at the end
9291,Betty  Given,she was ok but i heard that she selects students to stay after class to watch her grade tests
9292,Betty  Given,i like her she forgave me and accepted that a piece of scratch paper really could just be a joke
9293,Betty  Given,very easy willingness to help with understanding of assignments
9294,Betty  Given,very nice and an easy teacher
9295,Betty  Given,no comments
9296,Betty  Given,no comments
9297,Betty  Given,she is a easy teacher but ask her to help you outside of class because she go out of her way
9298,Bob  Fey,a difficult teacher but fair his tests are difficult and his lectures move quickly he seem to have much time to personally help a student but most teachers fey is a funny guy with a smart wit and good sarcastic humor he is cool enough but a hard microccon class
9299,Bob  Fey,fey has a funny and sarcastic sense of humor and loves to blend it in very knowledgable about economics class seems dull at times and boring the class was a bit difficult but i think its more about the curiculum more than anything else
9300,Bob  Fey,problem is he treats students like intelligent adults and at ivc most
9301,Bob  Fey,no comments
9302,Bob  Fey,this class was boring and i was really interested in taking it the tests were really hard and all those graphs wanted to make me scream i would not recommend this teacher if you want to get a good grade
9303,Bob  Fey,no comments
9304,Bob  Fey,extremely boring he speaks in the same tone at all times and moves his arm across the board slowly very tiring class and i do not recommend taking him in half the semester you will fall asleep
9305,Bob  Fey,very difficult if you want to pass econ do not take it with him tests are very tricky multiple choice but it is often the type with choice or choice only those kind learn much in the ways of econ in fact i have to retake it
9306,Bob  Fey,i got a c in this class i worked my ass off and recorded all my works and tests i gotten a high b or even an a bad tests bad lecture bad grader
9307,Bob  Fey,his test is really tricky his lecture help us understand mirco
9308,Bob  Fey,standardized class pretty clear not easy to come by
9309,Bob  Fey,i really like prof fey he is helpful and i think really looks out for his students best interests the tests are hard but he always gave free points and his lectures are somewhat boring but he does his best to make them interesting i recommend

9311,Bob  Fey,his black humor sometimes just really funny and his lecture sounds easy but the exam is not easy at all have to read really hard to get good grade in that class
9312,Bob  Fey,you get out of class early thats about the only good thing about fey his voice will put you to sleep guarentee
9313,Bob  Fey,i had him two years ago he was pretty easy always got out of class early
9314,Bob  Fey,he is the worst teacher ever had notes study guide his test and anything that could be unclear he clarify he sucks
9315,Bob  Fey,he only teaches using powerpoint slides which you can also get from the online site i pretty much had been teaching myself because he teach oh tone is like a robot that says it all take mcneil
9316,Bob  Fey,the first test the avg was the second test the avg was he doesnt teach how to apply what is taught in class the decrease in avg reflects on his teaching methods
9317,Nathan  Greene,his tests were pretty hard but he scales them and gives extra credit here and there which helps a lot overall the entire semester i thought i was doing badly because i did poorly on my tests but ended up with an a he is very nice and i thought he was funny lectures are kind of boring but i think anyone could make geology interesting
9318,Nathan  Greene,nice guy kind of weird you know when people tell you geology is only rocks yeah basically his lectures were absoluetly boring he made jokes that were never funny then again probably because of his canadian humour simple tes
9319,Nathan  Greene,i had him for geology he was super
9320,Chris  Gould,i knew him for years he is a tough and a hard enough teacher to make sure you will learn enough to get a job he is one of the smartest teacher in my animation program he is a very friendly person he does teaches new things like how to make a digital storyboard he also knows a lot of how the film industry works as well
9321,Chris  Gould,very good teacher

9334,Tom  Albright,good teacher very nice guy gives somewhat difficult exams but is helpful outside of class i would recommend taking his course solid accounting professor
9335,Tom  Albright,he is not nearly as helpful as he thinks he is he is also not someone you want in your corner as he is two faced
9336,Tom  Albright,i took this course in the summer and dr albright was terrible he was definitely not teaching at an undergraduate level i recommend taking ac with him
9337,Tom  Albright,he is not a good teacher he helped write the text book that we used and he loved talking about writing it he did not teach at an intro level and was not helpful when you had questions i would not recommend him to anyone
9338,Tom  Albright,good teacher
9339,Tom  Albright,wonderful teacher the reason i majored in accounting
9340,Tom  Albright,very nice and tries to teach it well but he is so used to dealing with grad students that he often assumes everyone knows whats going on and doesnt explain it thoroughly for people who dont get it the tests are not easy you do need to study hard for them know how to do financial statements backwards and forwards
9341,Tom  Albright,no comments
9342,Tom  Albright,for an old man he is fairly good looking
9343,Tom  Albright,no comments
9344,Tom  Albright,i had him for honors intro to accounting he did a very good job of teaching the material the tests and quizes you take in honors accounting are exactly the same as those given in the regular section the only difference is that you do an easy group proj
9345,Tom  Albright,no comments
9346,Tom  Albright,dr albright was my ac210 honors teacher what an amazing individual he did an exceptional job explaining accounting as it was my first experience with the class
9347,Susan  Lindahl,very nice professor that offers lots of extra credit even free points on tests ie just mark a if struggling which happen much she is very accessible for office hours and gets back to you frequently on emails topics are also interesting and easy to learn also just music and learning to appreciate it fantastic class
9348,Susan  Lindahl,super easy class for nonmusic majors definitely have to put effort into studying for exams if you want a good grade but there are a lot of easy points in the class to boost your grade if you do well on the exams tons of extra credit points i went into the final exam with over in the class online hw due before class is easy
9349,Susan  Lindahl,susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit it is extremely hard to not get above an a in this class no attendance is taken however there are quizzes throughout the semester most of the time you can use your notes she provides you the answer or gives you points for trying this is a very easy class for a up
9350,Susan  Lindahl,professor lindahl is easily one of best plenty of extra credit opportunities and attendance is not taken although there are weekly quizzes that you can use notes on you have to attend concerts outside of class and write a review about them but it as bad as it sounds this is a very easy class and susan only helps to prove it
9351,Susan  Lindahl,she was awesome take attendance but does in class responses randomly easy a if you have the notes exams you can use a notecard so it too bad plenty of opportunities for extra credit would definitely take her again
9352,Susan  Lindahl,pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and do fine there are in class quizzes at the end but you can use notes tests concerts and project all easy to get on she is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class boring class but super easy a
9353,Susan  Lindahl,lindahl was a great professor to have for this class you are required to go to concerts for the class throughout the semester but less than other mus114 professors if you keep up on the online quizzes you can always get and do the extra credit youll be totally fine she really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful
9354,Susan  Lindahl,she the most sympathetic professor but it is so easy to pass the class she offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get on them show up to class though because there are little inclass responses that add up to points throughout the semester you have to attend concerts and write about them overall ok
9355,Susan  Lindahl,organized professor very nice lady and very understanding easy a if you attend class and put forth the effort learned a lot i have never known before would recommend if you were to take the class
9356,Susan  Lindahl,great class all you have to do is show up and pay attention make sure you get the right notecards i went to a performing arts school in middle school so i already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont the class was with about other kids so go to her office hours if need be
9357,Susan  Lindahl,dr lindahl is great i am not majoring in anything musicrelated but took this class because i heard it was an easier wi she even give that many writing assignments and the ones that she does assign are easy the homework is really simple and the exams too bad either go to class because she does inclass assignments sometimes
9358,Susan  Lindahl,as sure for many who are reading this i am not in the music program nor am i an expert even after this course but it was a really easy to pass course professor lindahl offers a ton of extra credit and you not get a on the online homework and quizzes if you need a music class for graduation this is the way to go
9359,Susan  Lindahl,prof lindahl was great she knew that almost the entire class was taking it because it was an easy up easy homework online music guides that had to be completed in a week no reason why you get an a all the answers were in the book so the assignments were very easy a great prof if you understand music as she makes it fun
9360,Susan  Lindahl,although i understand music nor have i ever taken a music class she made things very simple the only way you pass this class is if you do any of the work if you put in the effort regardless of your test grades you will pass with an a
9361,Susan  Lindahl,professor lindahl is a great professor who does a good job at explaining the idea of music to non music majors she gives you guided notes and if you pay attention you will do good on the exam she offers lots of extra credit and gives you ample time to complete assignments
9362,Susan  Lindahl,professor lindahl was an awesome professor she is very passionate about music and it makes it easy to put in the effort if she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade attendance is highly recommended
9363,Susan  Lindahl,susan was a great professor she gave many extra credit opportunities and allowed everyone to pass with at least an a if effort was put in showing up to class is not mandatory but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade she is very passionate about music but is also respectful to those that
9364,Susan  Lindahl,i really liked her she was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace very organized loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached lots of extra credit opportunities she really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet
9365,Susan  Lindahl,she is by far my favorite professor here at cmu she is so nice and is willing to work with you in any given situation there are quizzes online every week but you can take them until you get i took this as a writing intensive and there were only short papers so it was a relief i would definitely recommend her for mus
9366,Susan  Lindahl,class was filled with fill in the blank notes and all you needed to study and fill out the study guides with tests go along with the study guide and even a review in class for extra credit helpful but a little sassy online homework was super easy too it take long at all
9367,Melbourne  Hovell,dr hovell is one of the toughest but best profs had he is fair but extremely demanding which is good preparation for publishing in the real world one of the best adherers to scientific principles that encountered
9368,Melbourne  Hovell,stay away from this professor my experience was anything but good
9369,Melbourne  Hovell,difficult to understand
9370,Melbourne  Hovell,dr hovell helped me to achieve my goals and has been a great advisor he understands psychology unlike any other professor at state
9371,Melbourne  Hovell,mel is the best professor i ever had thanks to his passion and sincerity i excelled in his classes and went on to become a professor in public health myself i think that a building should be named after this man
9372,Melbourne  Hovell,no comments
9373,Melbourne  Hovell,hard and unclear like the way he teaches
9374,John  Alcaraz,biostats is hard with his lecture book and sample tests you will do fine be aware he is deaf in one ear so if you sit on that side of him in class your questions or attempts to get his attention will go unresponded to he is very shy but very kind if you meet him in office hours
9375,John  Alcaraz,omg this class is hard the professor reads literally each work from the lecture notes and adds some other details to the notes but overall he just reads from them the sample tests are really helpful in understanding how to translate the formulas into practice and after doing the first exam it gets easier very nice person but boring class
9376,John  Alcaraz,this class was so hard be prepared to teach yourself and spend a lot of time doing it so quiet and class and literally goes over no examples in class he just reads the notes to you that you purchase in the bookstore
9377,John  Alcaraz,good teachervery fair and impartial uber smart he knows everything about the subject very nice too
9378,John  Alcaraz,guys biostats is tough n this man on earth makes it even tougher a pathetic professor ask him to speak without notes n guess what he is tongue tied
9379,John  Alcaraz,biostatistics is a difficult topic many people do not attend class because it can be very boring especially the class the notes he provides are very clear and the sample exams are perfect for studying for exams he is also shy and make sure to ask your questions clearly and aloud
9380,John  Alcaraz,his class may not be the most exciting but if you go to class take notes and study his sample exams there is no reason why you should fail his tests are open book open notes you can bring in anything you want to help you nice guy although he may be hard to understand at times
9381,John  Alcaraz,no comments
9382,John  Alcaraz,very nice.if you listen and follow along then you will do well in the class.if you talk to him during office hours he is helpful
9383,John  Alcaraz,boring not a good lecturer understand the material and not nice tests are open book
9384,Jenny  Quintana,dr quintana is one of the best professors ever had her lectures are interesting and clear her passion for the subject of environmental health is palpable and rubs off on her students exams are very comprehensive but not inherently difficult she is very approachable and happy to talk with her students
9385,Jenny  Quintana,while nice her class was extremely boring and she mostly read off the powerpoint often times her sentences droned on to nowhere not very impressed considering it was a grad school level class
9386,Jenny  Quintana,amazing teacher made the subject very interesting and kept everyone awake at
9387,Jenny  Quintana,great class i learned a lot tests are very comprehensive both from the lectures and the book a challenging class but well worth it
9388,Jenny  Quintana,waste your time going to class all lectures are posted very boring and unclear
9389,Jenny  Quintana,nice friendly understanding and interesting
9390,C  Jochim,professor jochim is amazing one of the best professors i had in my life passionate understanding and such a wonderful professor take him if you can
9391,C  Jochim,a very nice professor exams one being the final and research papers quizzes are online but it helps to attend class if you want to understand the lectures better then reading the books help a lot i came by his office hours and he helped answer my questions
9392,C  Jochim,engaging friendly intelligent and overall a nice guy tests are easy papers are long but i enjoyed doing the research and writing my paper interesting topics and lively discussion an eye opener in my opinion gives an in depth understanding of the chinese religious culuture and traditions take this class a lot of fun
9393,C  Jochim,great professor great class he will help you understand all the material a study guide is provided to help you out on essay questions also the papers are easy as well he is not a tricky professor he is clear and friendly totally recommend him
9394,C  Jochim,great class but the daoism book is very ambiguous to comprehend but the project and class discussion is exciting the first exam is super easy keep up the reading and some background knowledge on chinese cultures would be helpful for the exam wish the teacher could do more group work awesome teacher very humble person
9395,C  Jochim,prof jochim is willing to help students succeed he responds quickly to email
9396,C  Jochim,his courses are not easy especially when you get into the different types of buddhism a lot of info to be discussed in a short time get a lot out of his classes if you show up on time do the work and put in a little extra time reading well worth it in the end
9397,C  Jochim,his chinese traditions class was great well researched and well presented his traditions of india class started great but you can tell by the end of the class it was not his strongest area
9398,C  Jochim,lectures can get boring so it may difficult to prepare for the exams however he gives out a review sheet with all the possible short essay questions ask just do your research into it and be fine come exam day your grade is made up of an essay and the rest is from midterms
9399,C  Jochim,kinda easy but like diffuclt subject to understand buddhism watch but boring because even he sleeps while watching them requirements for buddhism midterms final presentation paper
9400,Daniel  Rodeheaver,weekly discussion posts that had to be done had to read the online textbook ta posts notes on bb that were helpful for the tests tests were somewhat easy answers are all in the textbook or in the lecture ppts for a freshman level class it required some more work than i liked read syllabus carefully he required us to send a welcome email
9401,Daniel  Rodeheaver,took his honors class i used to like sociology before i had him he could not be more full of himself avoid his classes
9402,Daniel  Rodeheaver,class is rigorous you must read the book to do good on the quizzes the test are not related to the book you must go to class you must also have a good understanding of theories pertaining to developing nations
9403,Daniel  Rodeheaver,he is not very helpful and does not care to work with students if you take his online class know that his test are only open from to noon which is not very helpful for anyone that works and goes to school he also will not allow you to print or save study material again very unhelpful to someone who works and goes to school
9404,Daniel  Rodeheaver,i took his honors class he obviously thinks highly of himself and i disagreed with the biased point of view he taught however the class itself too difficult two books lecture material online tests covered all aspects could use the on them for accuracy but still needed to know the info prior or be out of luck
9405,Daniel  Rodeheaver,this class is hard and that is an understatement i only missed classes the entire semester and was still lost you have to read the book and pay attention to every detail in lecture to understand what this man is talking about and even will probably still be lost i have never taken a class so hard and ive taken many hard classes
9406,Daniel  Rodeheaver,horrible prof i agree with earlier comments that if you attend you will do well i have only missed one class and i am always lost the tests are ridiculous they have almost nothing to do with lecture and require you to remember tiny statistics out of the book i would never take this prof again
9407,Daniel  Rodeheaver,he typically has tests the first test is literally over book adn the test over a book he does let you use a study guide with the test but in a min class the test would have questions meaning if you had to think about a question for more than seconds you had to turn your test in incomplete hated this teacher
9408,Daniel  Rodeheaver,he is ridiculous i always attend class and am still completely lost.and this research paper is the hardest thing i have to thus far in my yrs unt.definately not for people who need a clear depiction of whats required of you
9409,Daniel  Rodeheaver,i thought he was ok and kind of nice yes he does come at the subject from a unique point of view that i agree with and it was obvious that he thought a lot of himself but he made sure the tests covered exactly what was learned you need to read the book to do well on the tests and you need to attend lecture to do well on the essays
9410,Daniel  Rodeheaver,i say he is a bad prof once you get the hang of his class he is a bit arrogant and its his way or no way when it comes down to it his class hard if you read and attend his lectures he is all about his research i got a c in the class with minimal effort however an a is possible if you participate and pay attention
9411,Daniel  Rodeheaver,worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life if you want to fail a class go ahead and take this class
9412,Daniel  Rodeheaver,not the easiest class you have to pay attention and read or an a is out of the question class attendance helps too nice guy though curved my b to an a because i attended most of the classes and made high on the tests
9413,Daniel  Rodeheaver,horrible horrible horrible never take his class he is such a mean guy and loves to make students lives bad also he takes it out on the whole class if students miss or walk out i know it is rude to walk out but i dont blame the students who did with this guy
9414,Daniel  Rodeheaver,worst class i ever took at nt all he does is listen to himself talk boring will except no opinion but his own not a hard class just hard to stay awake tries to piss students off because even he gets bored with his endless slide shows an idiot with half a brain read the book and taught the class
9415,Daniel  Rodeheaver,pretty easy class will cuve grades not very interesting make sure to do all reading will occasionally give extra credit for attendance
9416,Daniel  Rodeheaver,definately not easy and not in the least interested in being your friend but if interested in urban sociology or development you must take his courses freaking brilliant just screw around in class plus i like his guatelmala stories
9417,Daniel  Rodeheaver,he is one of the easiest teachers ever.i was definitely not one of his favs missed too many classes even had to makeup a missed test he even require a semester paper extra credit anyone that thinks he is hard is retarded and should not be in a higher education facility he does ramble about guatemala but it fits with the class
9418,Daniel  Rodeheaver,as one commernter put it run from this professor not walk he is extremely unhelpful when asked to clarify he becomes beligerent puts it back off on you as if you are stupid unwilling to go out of his way to help you the student be prepared to read and basically teach yourself the material
9419,Daniel  Rodeheaver,worst prof i have had in my years in college he is hateful mean rude it is apparent that he is a man who is unhappy in his life will take his power of being a professor use it against his students he tries to make things as hard as he can took him online only allowed seconds per question on tests take him
9420,Susan  Keehn,she is passionate and yes you will learn alot but the work load is overwhelming and will dominate all of your time
9421,Susan  Keehn,dr keehn is the best utsa has to offer you will work hard in this class but it is well worth it i will be a better teacher because of dr keehn
9422,Susan  Keehn,her passion extensive knowledge and understanding of children definately shines through each lecture
9423,Susan  Keehn,dr keehn is one of the best utsa has to offer she is passionate about educating children and creative in her methods you will learn more than you can imagine be prepared to work hard and stay organized just be late for class
9424,Susan  Keehn,dr keehn goes above and beyond all other professors ever had and will proabably ever have she is wonderful cares about all of her students and strives to turn out the best teachers if all of the professors in the college of education were like her we would be so prepared for lies ahead in teaching
9425,Susan  Keehn,great professor you can tell that she was once the teacher in texas she has a true passion for helping our atrisk students she is also bilingual
9426,Susan  Keehn,take dr keehn she is tough but worth it you will learn a tremedous amount of useful knowledge in her class we love you dr keehn
9427,Susan  Keehn,awesome professor she is incredible she demands alot from you but she takes you through it step by step and helps you every bit along the way she is so interested in your growth as a preservice teacher as long as you do the work and make an effort you will do good in the class be professional
9428,Susan  Keehn,dr keehn is the best prof ever taken she leads her class by modeling instead of standing up there and lecturing to us what we should do as teachers she shows a personal interest and gets to know everyone of her students by name something few profs care to do anymore
9429,Susan  Keehn,keehn is a very fun teacher and she really knows what she is doing and talking about i had her for early literacy and so much fun she made the class fun and we got to act like the kids be teaching she is an awesome professor
9430,Susan  Keehn,dr keehn is a wonderful educator and a blessing to all students
9431,Jerry  Scripps,my only complaint with dr web applications course was that his material was somewhat dated direct questions about html5 or new javascript standards fell by the wayside that being said scripps has an interest in data science so his thoughts and answers on the internet and web technologies as a whole are very insightful
9432,Jerry  Scripps,tough class he seems to struggle to help the students who know nothing about coding but is willing to do what it takes to help lots of projects which he go much over beforehand and he expects you to try it on your own first
9433,Jerry  Scripps,this was the most boring lecture and i eventually stopped attending if you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own you should get an easy a this was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work i think jerry was a very smart prof but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level
9434,Jerry  Scripps,i took scripps for comp sci he certainly knew what he was doing when it came to programming and he usually was able to get the information across no real tests during the class other than midterm and final he uses a flipped classroom so be sure to watch the videos before class good not great teacher would take him again though
9435,Jerry  Scripps,scripps has a very unique style of teaching you watch all of the lectures on youtube before class as homework and then go over the topics in class this method helps a lot because you can code right along with him and can pause and rewind any questions can be addressed the next day in class as you go over examples very good professor
9436,Jerry  Scripps,scripps is a bad ass dude take this thug for your classes because a great teacher scripps if life scripps is love scripps is all
9437,Jerry  Scripps,i went in with a tiny bit of programming experience and have not found the class to be all that difficult scripps was an overall average teacher in my opinion very funny though
9438,Jerry  Scripps,scripps is a great teacher some people new to coding might have trouble but very available to help if having issues as is the lab assistant and your classmates not too much textbook use flipped classroom style was extremely helpful taking him next semester for
9439,Jerry  Scripps,scripps a easy teacher he can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding but he really do a good job teaching it to you he much help in labs at all either hard at first because i had no programming or coding experience i learned everything just fine but mostley by myself with my text book a funny guy tho
9440,Jerry  Scripps,the course itself is difficult starts off really easy but by the end of it left confused unless you already have a background in visual basic coding scripps was funny and nice class was usually pretty entertaining the only downside is that when in lab he that helpful he just kinda shows you what to do
9441,Jerry  Scripps,this class itself can be difficult especially if you have no prior experience in programming but all around scripps is a excellent professor he makes the class fun and he is really laid back
9442,Jerry  Scripps,the class is hard but not rating the class rating scripps and he is the man
9443,Jerry  Scripps,i had this course a while ago he is a great guy but expect to work a a lot i had a little bit of programming experience before and still had some difficulty now years later i am good at java i can see how this class could be a blast i really feel like i learned from him until the end of the semester though
9444,Jerry  Scripps,if never had prior programming experience expect to understand lectures having said that he is very nice and a fun prof
9445,Jerry  Scripps,he is a great guy extremely helpful and actually makes class fun
9446,Jerry  Scripps,jerry is a funny teacher and very easy to get along and work with
9447,Jerry  Scripps,make no mistake about it if never had programming before this class will be very difficult that being said jerry is a really nice guy and i ended up with a b and should have gotten a c his car examples are a bit lame but we does try to communicate the best he can
9448,Jerry  Scripps,scripps have a clear class structure bounced from one idea to another in random order and sometimes came back to previous ideas with limited notes he was not well prepared for class students with some experience could have taught this class he relied on students knowledge to write the correct syntax and he referred us to google alot
9449,Jerry  Scripps,this professor is ill educated in the line of his teaching i feel as though he was a waste of my tuition and time i would not ever take him as a professor again nor would i recommend him to anyone else never was well prepared for classes and the students seemed to teach more than him
9450,Jerry  Scripps,i know why this guy have a yellow smiley face by his name as someone else said he is the man
9451,Richard  Gendron,hillarious and insightful a real treat to hear talk but you need to put in some effort to do well
9452,Richard  Gendron,if you do not pay attention you will not pass the class he is an extremely tough grader that being said you only get graded on separate things midterms paper and a final if you pay attention and do the reading you will be fine for the most part but showing up to class is a must or you will fall too behind and not do well good luck
9453,Richard  Gendron,i absolutely loved this class i would definitely recommend him as a professor a nononsense kind of guy and his lectures are really eyeopening to happening in the world
9454,Richard  Gendron,deviant behavior was the best class taken at assumption the class is very easy for the most part because you are studying how people defy norms in society lectures are awesome best had he gives examples with the notes which are essential for your in class essays overall amazing professor and great class
9455,Richard  Gendron,professor gendron is probably the best professor at assumption college he gives you the honest truth and actually talks about stuff that is relevant to society his lectures are extremely interesting and he is more than helpful during his office hours but be on your cellphone during class
9456,Richard  Gendron,not really sure why he has a chili pepper because he is old but nevertheless an awesome really hard but it was worth it he tells it how it is and give you all the politically correct bs a very cut and dry person really enjoyed his class
9457,Richard  Gendron,best professor at assumption college always keeps discussions entertaining and insightful also he is the most knowledgable person i have ever met
9458,Richard  Gendron,absolutely the best professor i have taken at assumption he is clearly passionate about what he teaches and his lectures are so engaging and interesting taking gendron made me decide to be a criminology concentrator miss out on this prof
9459,Richard  Gendron,no comments
9460,Richard  Gendron,he is an amazing professor i liked going to his class every day and he influenced me to become a sociology major the exams can be difficult but he gives study guides class discussions are usually interesting and he shows movies sometimes which helps class go by fast
9461,Richard  Gendron,go to his office hrs he likes to know his students before all of his tests he gives study guides but his tests are hard and not all the info on the test comes from the study guide so make sure you use your book for reference min are assigned analyzing newspaper articles
9462,Richard  Gendron,very intelligent passionate and helpful great to talk to outside of class wants you to succeed and does everything he can to make sure you do awesome awesome professor
9463,Richard  Gendron,best prof at ac easy to talk to laid back knows his stuff passionate about what teaching
9464,Richard  Gendron,knows his passionate not your average professor highly reccomend his class his class made my decision to be a soc major you will love it
9465,Richard  Gendron,gendron is the best he is so hot he is an awesome teacher his method of teaching is really helpful in and outside of the classroom
9466,Richard  Gendron,gendron is amazing i say enough good things about him a fair grader and really makes class interesting
9467,Richard  Gendron,gendron is awesome so helpful and nice
9468,Richard  Gendron,he is easily the most intelligent professor on this campus sorry i waited until my senior year to take a class with him really make you think about things in a new way highly recommended
9469,Richard  Gendron,would definately recommend him to anyone he really tries to the class and you learn so much
9470,Richard  Gendron,gendron is hot influenced my decision to become a major the best professor on the ac campus
9471,William  Smith,i took two of mr classes but i had withdraw during the second class now he is no longer teaching at tcc he is an excellent teacher and a very nice person thank you mr smith
9472,William  Smith,i had prof smith back in although we had different opinions politically and they were discussed at length in class he was one of my favorites the way he conducted himself and the class was wonderful
9473,William  Smith,excellent professor very passionate about what teaching involves class in a lot of discussion gives study guides that walk you through the test practically if you give it some effort not hard to make an a in any of his classes
9474,William  Smith,he is very educated and concise he challanges his student and pushes the line of reasoning and critical thinking he is fun and makes his content relate to his own life experiences
9475,William  Smith,prof smith has to be one of the best in the world i recommend that everyone try to take one of his classes he will engage you in discussion and make you really think scott
9476,Laura  Orella,laura is one of the worst english professors on campus she is moody aggressive and tries so hard to be liked by her students that she comes off very annoying i took her for ewrt on campus and she was very unorganized and confusing she have a set calendar and her canvas page was a mess and she was very rude if you asked for clarity
9477,Laura  Orella,absolutely terrible this been stressful af her online class is so disorganized she grades essays strictly by format so useless i could learn more from a brick wall that from her i felt like i was begging for help to no avail students that either were interested in learning or at least want a fair teacher avoid
9478,Laura  Orella,ewrt class is the worst online class i have taken she makes no effort to explain anything let alone teach and her comments on papers are vague and unhelpful if you want to learn anything about writing you are in the wrong class if you want to work very hard for a low grade and be on your own this is the class for you
9479,Laura  Orella,this class is super easy but you learn a thing actually i am pretty sure my writing got worse as the quarter progressed because i was able to completely blow off all the assignments until a few hours before they were due and still get on the papers
9480,Laura  Orella,i see why there is so much negativity her class is bearable and so long as you turn in your work and participate your bound to get a good grade she is reasonable and offers great info prior to your essays i would personally recommend the online class i got an a in the class and did little more than expected of a student
9481,Laura  Orella,mrs orella was a good teacher you had to be in class and understand the work being asked to do just like any other class her class hard at all you had to earn a good grade but this class did improve my writing
9482,Laura  Orella,i see most other students were just as unhappy with this instructor as i was i ended up really sick and emailed this instructor that i needed her to work with me re assignments etc after absolutely no reply i dropped the class via web not sure if there system glitch the class didnt drop she gave me an f and i never even turned anything in
9483,Laura  Orella,such a cute lady orella is super nice and outgoing and she makes you feel comfortable in class only essays total and no exams easy readings assigned
9484,Laura  Orella,online class too many essays and lots of reading essays total and she very helpful when you ask questions my main issue with online was all of the smaller forum posting requirements and due dates that are placed in various places on the website can be tricky would not recommend this online format
9485,Laura  Orella,you have to be organized to take this class not structured by week but by major assignment difficult if you already know how to write essays give feedback on rough drafts peers on your essay after its graded lecture you learn by doing workbook sheets essays rough draft various exercises online research
9486,Laura  Orella,absolutely horrendous online class and while i have to do the chats weekly that some others mention i can relate to the frustration she grades things weeks after they are due her class is completely unorganized and she never responds to anything her feedback on your submissions is vague and of no help at all i wish i could rate lower
9487,Laura  Orella,the worst and most lazy teacher her with the dean it is not fair to have teachers like her.she canceled more than half of the not check drafts classmates do.the final is really a draft that you send by email.she replies telling you something general about your helpful.i wonder if she really reads the essays
9488,Laura  Orella,her online class is horribly confusing she is totally unhelpful and snaps at you when you ask for help instead of answering your questions and the assignments and readings she gives are not easy
9489,Laura  Orella,in person its an online class but we had a mandatory orientation for an hour kind of hyper a little intimidating the online course is somewhat confusing if you look all over the place for clues on deadlines instructions etc gonna have problems she is a bit unclear and that is why i prefer to actually go to a classroom
9490,Laura  Orella,this lady has to be one of the worst teachers at deanza you have to be an accomplished writer to get an a she teach you anything about writing and yes you have to think like her and agree with everything that comes out of her mouth
9491,Laura  Orella,she is great teacher she help me on wpe test from sacramento state her class is easy and fun i enjoyed her class very much after i take her class my reading and writing skill improve very much
9492,Laura  Orella,very unclear about what she wants you never know your grade until the very end comments on the rough drafts never make sense she doesnt actually read them and tries to make her students opinions fit hers in the pointless and frustrating dont take this class if you like to know what it going on
9493,Laura  Orella,unclear moody should be teaching grade school tries to mold students opinions to fit hers site is completly unorganized tons of pointless work this is an analytical class but be writing informational papers and learning elementary grammar never disliked a class so much awful
9494,Laura  Orella,this is an online class in which she requires one hour of class chat weekly between pm which makes up points of your grade and two group presentations supposed to post online definitely suggest taking this class unless you like doing an excessive amount of work
9495,Laura  Orella,hard to navigate through the interface if you are not too computer savy.she doesnt seem to help too much.you have to really be patient and work through the site.content wise its not a hard class.the structure of the class makes it frustrating.you wont learn much about writing here

9502,Wayne  Erickson,he is an amazing professor very easy only a few papers are due during the semester but he has not final exam i really loved him he is funny only thing bad about him is he is kinda boring at times.but other then that this class is an easy a
9503,Wayne  Erickson,love him so awesome and fun
9504,Wayne  Erickson,wow he was awesome and helpful loved his class wish he taught only wrote papers and no final

9506,Wayne  Erickson,he comes in sits down and talks for hours straight nevermind if you understand off on some random tanget by the time you get a notebook out

9508,Wayne  Erickson,awesome insightful teacher if you ever need or want to read anything by spencer this is the guy to study it with
9509,Wayne  Erickson,he is extremely funny the first day of class i was convinced he was mentally insane but by the end i was in love with him doesnt care about attendence very loose about due dates but care about important stuff like the quality of your work he claims to be a hard but a fairly easy it pretty much rings true
9510,Wayne  Erickson,he taught my senior seminar class and since never taught it before just kind of tossed things up in the air to see where land thought be tough being required to graduate but he kept all his same policies of attendance and due dates meaning none at all confusing off the wall made us cringe but glad i had him after all
9511,Wayne  Erickson,probably the most irreverent teacher have he can be a little dull at times but mostly very fun and helpful due dates are by no means set in stone and he will actually give you youre paper topics an easy b hard a
9512,Wayne  Erickson,very passionate intelligent incredibly blasphemous and vexatiously political funny lenient grader no one could possibly make an f or a d in here i got all care about due dates as long as you talk to him
9513,Wayne  Erickson,he has a strange concept of proper academic writing i have never gotten grades so low on papers before b and and his identifications on his tests sometimes seem like they are asking the third word on page
9514,Wayne  Erickson,this guy knows what talking about so well that sometimes hard for himt o convey it all to students however he is always willing to negotiate on due dates and he makes you earn your grades very passionate and fun teacher
9515,Wayne  Erickson,he is enthusiastic he really made me become a better writer and a better reader he is interesting and helpful
9516,Audrey  Cohen,she was very rude let you ask questions if you were unsure about her assignments which was like all the time she was absent every class after the first month of the semester no warnings notes anything it was a horrible class
9517,Audrey  Cohen,no comments
9518,Audrey  Cohen,i did good work but lame grade appreciate here approach to teaching
9519,Audrey  Cohen,no comments
9520,Audrey  Cohen,no comments
9521,Audrey  Cohen,this is one professor i did not learn much from when a student asks for help and she doesnt know how to explain it say why you do it for homework she also does not know what her own syllabus says she know her own grading policy
9522,Stafford  Rorke,ah dr rorke the gatekeeper and decider for all things whp although he can be intimidating and expect a lot of students he is overall consistently clear on expectations as long as you know where to look new students heed warning and check all syllabi posted on the whp section of the oakland website the answers are there just read
9523,Stafford  Rorke,i took whp310 as an online class with rorke he definitely knows his stuff i would say he is not the most approachable or understanding professor his class is very interesting though all online exams are only open for a short window of time be prepared not an easy a study for exams even though they are open notes
9524,Stafford  Rorke,he is just awesome tough professor but wonderful
9525,Stafford  Rorke,excellent professor i thoroughly enjoyed his lectures and look forward to future courses with him he is very knowledgeable and well published in his field
9526,Stafford  Rorke,dr be to declare whp as a major and i graduated last spring encouraged grad school ms in health ed i highly recommend him and the whp program for an undergrad
9527,Stafford  Rorke,i guess you either like him or you he is a bit full of himself and he is hard to please he is really serious all i have to say is have fun with the practical exam
9528,Stafford  Rorke,tough class but this prof is very into what he teaches i personally thought the class was kind of boring but i am not into this subject and only took the class because i needed an hc course the projects are tough and he grades hard the tests too bad though but you do have to know your stuff
9529,Stafford  Rorke,great professor

9531,Stafford  Rorke,the best professor at oakland ever he is very passionate about what he teaches and is very eager to help if you have questions or problems he goes out of his way to make learning not only fun but rewarding as well i say enough great things about him i would take more classes with him if i could oakland needs more professors like him
9532,Stafford  Rorke,just graduated from oakland in may dr rorke is an amazing professor he makes learning fun and inspires students he is straight to the point and is serious about his students education enjoyed every class that i took that dr rorke taught
9533,Stafford  Rorke,dr rorke is by far the best professor i have had at ou his enthusiasm and passion for his work is beyond words i learned more from this class than any other course at oakland tough teacher but rarely boring or difficult to remain attentive in class extremely helpful
9534,Stafford  Rorke,dr rorke is the best teacher at ou he is helpful funny and is always available to students i would take every class with him if i could his class is hard but you learn so much put in the time and effort and you will get an a
9535,Stafford  Rorke,great instructor he is extremely knowledgeable has a great deal of experience in the field and teaches with passion and enthusiasm he has high expectations of his students and challenges them to think for themselves but is always there to help anyone who asks
9536,Stafford  Rorke,he is from south africa and has the coolest accent hard not to pay attention in class

9539,Stafford  Rorke,his door is always open he will like you if he knows that you are trying
9540,Stafford  Rorke,awesome instructor very knowledgable man i loved listening to him talk favorite class
9541,Sophie  Weeks,very nice teacher fairly easy class she has a very slight accent but it get in the way at all grades fairly and is very helpful
9542,Sophie  Weeks,mrs weeks is very nice but a little strict on grading papers the english department made it hard to receive an a in the course a she is lenient on pushing due dates for papers but you really have to put effort into the paper itself she does care for the students but she does want her respect she has her pet peeves
9543,Sophie  Weeks,great teacher easy homework assignments flexible paper due dates class is a bit boring and really no need to attend to get an understanding but she takes attendance everyday so i would def go everyday overall great teacher
9544,Sophie  Weeks,mrs weeks is a very nice teacher she has good humor and is willing to help any student who asks for help very great professor
9545,Sophie  Weeks,mrs weeks is great she is so helpful and nice her papers actually have cool topics that interest you she is flexible on paper deadlines which can ease a lot of stress take this class for sure
9546,Sophie  Weeks,okay she will pushes the paper back a few days if the whole class is not able to turn it in on time or if u cant turn it in on time just tell her and she let u turn it on late she grade kinda hard on the papers
9547,Sophie  Weeks,ms weeks is french a little hard to understand at first but very helpful and a great teacher
9548,Leon  Stokesbury,has a great knowledge of poetry all late to class almost every day slow talker only talks about old white poets rambles on and on and god forbid you have a different opinion on a poem grades for the class unless you want to write a long extra credit paper expects you to be interested but you will struggle not to fall asleep
9549,Leon  Stokesbury,the thing you are going to absolutely hate him for the entirety of his class you are going to be bored from his rambling irritated at his disrespect frustrated at his teaching methods however at the end of the day he is going to make you a better writer if you listen to him pay heed to his criticisms the pain was worth it
9550,Leon  Stokesbury,if you cant appreciate his genius a reflection on you extremely serious abt poetry and demands the same of you am repulsed by the whiny ratings of others the best and most caring prof ever had
9551,Leon  Stokesbury,save yourself and your sanity and avoid dr stokesbury yes he knows what talking about and at times makes some nice points but his tests are absurdly difficult and he is fairly rude and abrasive steer clear of this one
9552,Leon  Stokesbury,mean spirited teaching style seems intent on discouraging his students from enjoying writing he give you any grades on your poems until you get your final grade after the semester i failed the course simply because i turn in a second revision of my poems i had worked on most of the semester and he graded them as zeros
9553,Leon  Stokesbury,absolutely by far the worst professor i have ever had rude arrogant for no reason at all and he is consistently minutes late to class but marks you absent if you are minute late his way or the highway even think about making suggestions the only way to get a good grade is to do exactly as he says no imagination
9554,Leon  Stokesbury,wow where to begin leon rambles endlessly when he does speak directly on a piece of poetry its a miracle if he has something important or poignant to say rude an ass and in no way at all helpful also too selfassured to ever be wrong so do not disagree with him or your grade will be affected one of my worst professors ever
9555,Leon  Stokesbury,stokesbury knows what talking about the hardest teacher ever had but i also learned more in form and theory than or other graduate classes put together take him if serious about learning not if looking for an easy a
9556,Leon  Stokesbury,his tests are hard he will make fun of you he will ramble about off topic subjects i learned the most from the other students
9557,Leon  Stokesbury,rambles on and on and on about the most random things tests are ridiculously hard basically have to memorize over identify stanzas from poems on the test then write as much as you possibly can on the poem wish i had never taken this class
9558,Leon  Stokesbury,stokesbury knows i learned more in this class than any other taken at gsu but his testing methods are pretty archaic from the old school ofchewyouupspityououtandseeif youcandance kind of teaching and a dick
9559,Leon  Stokesbury,not very open to alternate interpretation uses his own poetry in the class and makes you buy his books interesting speaker with lots of real world poetry experience
9560,Leon  Stokesbury,this is the best teacher i have ever had he really knows his stuff and works on your writing as hard as his own i recommend him for only those courageous enough to work and hear the truth about their work this guy really refines your stuff take often
9561,Leon  Stokesbury,wonderful professor if willing to work knows his stuff gets things done in class you definitely get your worth in his class but he tolerate idiots if you had problems with one of his classes you might fall into this category
9562,Leon  Stokesbury,i stand this class he tells the same stories over and over plus he seems to have this bizarre chip on his shoulder plus he sometimes makes comments at a expense
9563,Leon  Stokesbury,took him fall for creative writing in poetry made us spend to buy two of his poetry books that we opened only one of once he has a very pompous attitude takes roll and calls you out if not there bring food to class
9564,Leon  Stokesbury,tests very difficult knows his poetry hope you like patty ann rogers rolling naked in the dew and loves r frost leave class if he begins the food stamp story expect one of his own poems on the final
9565,Shele  Bannon,great teacher and i learned alot i love interaction it keeps me awake through the lectures she is very fair on grades and explains everything very clearly
9566,Shele  Bannon,she is so nice and so helpful this class has no tests just case studies that take a few minutes to type up and then one big project her class is handson and she guides you through building your own business highly recommended class and professor
9567,Shele  Bannon,a great professor very informative and understanding when you have problems
9568,John  Westwater,i eventually just stopped going to class and just taught myself the material no website no homework solutions little or no lecture preparation if you are looking for someone to actually teach you math avoid this prof
9569,John  Westwater,no comments
9570,John  Westwater,terrible avoid at all costs
9571,John  Westwater,just trust me
9572,John  Westwater,the most boring math lecturer i have ever had to sit through he is absolutely not helpful in class or outside of it
9573,John  Westwater,lecture is not really necessary as it help you much just skip and spend the time doing the homework the tests are unpredictable but not unfair
9574,John  Westwater,boring professor takes student suggestion works through it then states that it is erroneous tests seemingly correlate with hw material absolutely horrible
9575,John  Westwater,he really hates doing examples in class and will not unless you force him to instead he focuses on theorems asking questions in class is a must no calc or notes allowed on tests
9576,John  Westwater,his lectures were all about theorems and never examples of problems like some one said before the average of the test was super low plus he was always late for class the quarter was hell cause of this class
9577,John  Westwater,the man is bored with what he teaches i love him as a prof he pushes those who need to be pushed
9578,John  Westwater,the tests lectures and homework all have nothing to do with each other the homework is excessively long and almost no one can finish them as for the tests they had the lowest averages ever seenon one the mean was points out of
9579,Mary Ann  Nichols,most frustrating educational experience ever she did not clearly demonstrate what she wanted from me as a student writer her written comments were hard to read and harder to understand worst of all she bristled when asked for clarification help and guidance
9580,Mary Ann  Nichols,do not take this class it is super hard she is very unclear on what she wants you to fix for her essays i should have dropped the class but drop if you are not an english major got an f when i asked for help she laughed in my face and made me feel really stupid drop this class
9581,Mary Ann  Nichols,she loves what she does and can be slightly rude at times but means no harm is extremely hard at grading feed back is not enough help to improve your work discussions are the best gets you thinking had to drop of difficulty
9582,Mary Ann  Nichols,horrible professor take her if you are used to writing good essays she will be very rude laughing at your mistakes for instance when you ask for guidance
9583,Mary Ann  Nichols,proffesor nichols is extremely helpful throughout the entire course even though the class is not easy the topics and discussions covered make it worth it i received a b in her class
9584,Mary Ann  Nichols,the class is hard i got a c in class essays one pgs research paper about books for her class pop quiz is easy she is funny but you need to work hard very hard to pass the hardest english class ever taken in my life i love her and i hate her either
9585,Mary Ann  Nichols,hard grader points will be docked for every mistake you make on your essays do not take her if lazy however she really does care about your progress i shared a smoke break with her every day and she was always willing to discuss what i need to improve on she is a great and i respect her so much for pushing me to do my best
9586,Mary Ann  Nichols,prof nichols is pretty great although she is a super hard grader and definitely very particular about citations and following mla format i really disliked how many in class essays we had for her class three in class two out of class her harsh grading definitely helped my writing skills though take her if you want an easy a
9587,Mary Ann  Nichols,she is a great teacher she challenges to think and has many discussions you really have to read the books because she does give pop quizzes and they are necessary for the discussions a bit hard on grading essays but you can take the out of class essays to rewrite again for extra points and it helps out with your writing skills love her d
9588,Mary Ann  Nichols,she is fantastic yes she is a hard grader but just because she expects college students to write at college level she will patiently and clearly answer all of your and allows you to revise each of your takehome assignments for credit quizzes are easy just make sure you do the reading and come to class on time love her
9589,Mary Ann  Nichols,professor nichols is one of my favorite teachers here at pcc i had a class with her and i never dreaded coming to class because she made class so fun there were many discussions in the class which is always interesting always read the reading assignments and always come to class early or you will miss out on the pop quiz
9590,Mary Ann  Nichols,not that bad as people describe her take her in the summer she seems alot more chill quizzes were super easy and she gives you alot of chances to make up for points you just really have do good in essays she really cares about grammar clarity other than easy to get an a or b
9591,Mary Ann  Nichols,she doesnt care about situations and you will think shes a cool teacher but shes not her grading was crazy i had all and in english in high school and she would give me ad on my essays dont take her
9592,Mary Ann  Nichols,i her she is an awesome teacher very important the assignments if u make note n ur book ahead of time the in class essay do wonderful she always gives a hint bout the topic the essay besure to have all ur pages marked think bout what u can agrue the text and comeup with a few sentences memorized before ur essay
9593,Mary Ann  Nichols,she basically care about our situation the worst english professor i have never have in pcc
9594,Mary Ann  Nichols,her class was disappointing classes are about discussions of topics that do not have anything to do with english i wanted to learn more about essay structure but she never taught anything about it even though she was very hard while grading she does not have any office hours available and did not answer any of my emails never take her class
9595,Mary Ann  Nichols,nichols is really cool very friendly and upbeat not a hard grader in my felt this class was an esay a as long as you did the assignments all the people that complained about the workload must not have realized what english classes are about reading and writing lots of it duh
9596,Mary Ann  Nichols,extremely hard grader but deff learned a lot
9597,Mary Ann  Nichols,got an a in this class thanks to others english prof nichols is a terrible teacher as during the whole semester she has not taught a thing about how to be more effective in argumentative writing the class is spent in useless discussions on her personal opinions about different subjects but give any clues on how to write bett
9598,Mary Ann  Nichols,if english is not your first language i will not recommend you to take her and if you really like writing take someone else i agree with people here that she is a good teacher and she love to teach one thing you must know that she is quite a hard grader
9599,Lisa  Mach,nice instructor will answer texts if you have questions about assignment grades based on papers and journal entries does not require textbook but will print out short passages for you to read lectures tend to be long but she seems to care that you do well and provides you with useful feedback fair grader and opportunity for extra credit
9600,Lisa  Mach,engl was by far my favorite of my first semester in college professor mach provides her students with everything they need to know in order to be successful in her class she is always there for her students has a very clear grading criteria and is an overall exceptional professor she has the best attitude seen in a teacher amazing
9601,Lisa  Mach,english is my language and i struggle a lot writing essays therefore not a big fan of it but her class was great she is fun helpful and great thinking clear assignments and fair grading would take her in the future if i oculd
9602,Lisa  Mach,she is one of the most fun cool relaxed inspiring teachers ever had she is probably the best teacher i have ever had
9603,Lisa  Mach,she is one of the most fun cool relaxed inspiring teachers ever had she is probably the best teacher i have ever had
9604,Lisa  Mach,i had her at acc really nice fun class is mandatory abs allowed but understanding if you need more she give you an a but not hard to get one i never bought the book i just looked up the stories online definitely recommend her essays a final essay and some easy journal assignments take her if you can
9605,Lisa  Mach,extemely awesome teacher completely unlike your typical professor
9606,Lisa  Mach,absoultly love this women she is so laid back and easy to get along with she loves to have classes that interact and discuss rather then telling you what to know
9607,Lisa  Mach,its an easy a
9608,Lisa  Mach,really cool
9609,Lisa  Mach,mrs mach is a really cool teacher she jokes around with everyone and makes you feel comfortable i would recommend anyone to attempt to get her for an english teacher
9610,Francis  Catalano,charming witty cultured and charismatic i would date him but this is not a dating site do the weekly assignments and study concepts he tells you are going to be part of the essay questions and study guides and you will do well in his class
9611,Francis  Catalano,professor catalano is a cool dude really enjoyed his class attendance is mandatory if you want to pass tests are rather tough but he offered huge extra credit at the end of the semester oh and you need to buy his textbook about bucks i believe he said he curves final grades if needed he really wants you to do well
9612,Francis  Catalano,his class is very entertaining and is easy his classwork and homeworks are easy and he quiz you he also tells you whats going to be on the test which is awesome but theres alot he makes you write about three essays for each tests and there are also true false questions
9613,Francis  Catalano,his class was really fun he was very entertaining and kept the class interested he is very passionate for what he does and loves to interact with his students there are only three tests and are very easy if you read dont buy the humanities textbook posted online he has his own textbook that he requires you to buy tell you what to get
9614,Francis  Catalano,absolutely no structure to the class making it extremely difficult to know when or what to study must buy text book written by him and filled with spelling errors excessive rambling and organized poorly do not recommend
9615,Francis  Catalano,the tests are incredibly hard i saw that pretty much everyone in my class was getting the text book is a book that he wrote and full of typeos the lectures were extremely boring he does not have power points or notes so if you are a visual many people interested in this class may bother nice guy though
9616,Francis  Catalano,this class seems super cool but it is quite boring at times it focuses on the history of art but a cool guy a bit full of himself but a good professor class is based on activities you do from watching a video in class tests final and critical reviews on galleries there is extra credit take the class
9617,Francis  Catalano,he is an awesome prof took him during ext spring semi and got an a he is super easy he goes over what will be on the exam and makes you prepared only thing i like were the videos because they were kind of boring but overall i recommend him i wish he taught more courses so i can take him again easy a
9618,Francis  Catalano,i took his class in weeks and got an a his class is easy and he is a really nice prof i would take his class again just for fun i had two tests and final are tricky essay is easy and fill in blanks are easy one of the easiest class i have taken at pcc only thing i like was the boring videos we watched in class take him
9619,Francis  Catalano,prof.catalano is a very knowlegable professor.i took his class during my first semester at pcc i was so scared because english is my second language.but his tests are very straightforward and he will drop the lowest test score.also do all movie reviews because it will help to boost up your grade.best professor at person
9620,Francis  Catalano,buy the book pcc tells you to buy at the bookstore because he has you buy a different text this class is really good for those who are interested in art history if you find art history interesting probably think the class is super boring lots of memorization of art periods artists media types etc
9621,Francis  Catalano,good professor but he will let you buy textbook that be sold back because it comes with access code his tests are medium if you study you will pass and get good grades as simple as that tests movie reviews extra credit movie review and final exams he drops the lowest one grade final exam is not included he is soso
9622,Francis  Catalano,boring probably because it was a night class but i must give him credit for trying so hard to engage us he is quite the character and if you do the reading and assignments sure to ace the class assignments usually include going to the movies a play or museum and writing about it easy right
9623,Francis  Catalano,professor catalano is awesome he is really passionate with his teaching and he is definitely not boring study for the tests he gives you a review sheet and you will be fine great teacher i recommend this class percent
9624,Francis  Catalano,fun teacher tries to make class lively with jokes accents weird but enjoyable the course reader he makes you buy sucks cuz you only use pages but its mandatory in the entertainment business so the critical reviews are based in that area watch a visit museum write a review easy tells you exactly whats on the tests
9625,Francis  Catalano,passionate teacher just pay attention in class take notes and do the critical assignments and ec to pass
9626,Francis  Catalano,he is an awesome professor one of the best ever had he makes the class fun and interesting with his acting and drama voices boring movie to watch at the end of every class though tests are simple he emails a study guide of whats exactly on the test very sweet nice guy he will gladly help you with anything if you need it recommended
9627,Francis  Catalano,his coursereader is useless most of the content is copied from the book we have to buy it only for three coverpages he also allow us use copies of his coverpage may i ask who wants to spend bucks to buy only three coverpages so he is just a thoroughly profiteers
9628,Francis  Catalano,this teacher is really cool he was a usc professor this class is very easy to compare with another human4 teacher forman mr catalano did teach something take him you will get a
9629,Francis  Catalano,none
9630,Steven  Jones,he has a lot of heart and loves to teach he will make you an outstanding classical guitarist and a great lead guitar player if you play steel guitar too just be open to his teaching method and put in the hours
9631,Steven  Jones,do not take this class if you just want to learn regular guitar not just nylon string this class is classical style only you need to take instead there you can play acoustic or nylon string and cover several styles in jones class you have to play exactly how he tells you so if you change your playing way you be happy
9632,Steven  Jones,prof jones is an excellent passionate classical guitar teacher he teaches music theory so you understand it too his class is for classical guitar so be serious and open to this method he knows what he is talking about and there is a reason why you must do it as instructed it will all make sense when you advance to the more elaborate pieces
9633,Steven  Jones,one of the finest teachers at pcc if you are at all interested in classical guitar i implore you to take his class
9634,Steven  Jones,when i walked into the class i already had years of classical guitar lessons when i played for him he really beat me up over technique and i hated him for it but kept coming to class anyways it really payed off this guy is brutally honest but he genuinely cares about you take him no matter what level you are you will learn a lot
9635,Steven  Jones,prof jones is an excellent guitarist an even better instructor he has a passion for classical guitar he shares it with his students and makes sure technique is correct
9636,Steven  Jones,great teacher he enjoys helping students and has a great sense of humor he teaches everyone as if they had just begun playing guitar he is very interested in teaching his students and what they want to become all you have to do is practice playing and you do great
9637,Steven  Jones,he was a great teacher and really hammers home the fundamentals he teaches a student as if he knows nothing learning from the ground up i continued to go for repeated semesters because his love for music and teaching would rub off on me he is the best classical guitar teacher at pcc hands down
9638,Steven  Jones,extremely nice and always really good at teaching classical will love it
9639,Steven  Jones,apparently for a beginning classical guitar class you must have been playing and know to read music i took it for winter intersession for an intro guitar course but from day one he already has the intention of weeding out those who play suggest avoiding him if trying to learn it for fun
9640,Steven  Jones,this is my semester with mr jones and the reason for that is because he is a wonderful teacher really nice knows his stuff very smart i learned alot about theory too teaches what should be taught encourages everyone to play inspired me to keep on learning very fun class if you want to learn take this class worth it
9641,Steven  Jones,he is a gifted guitar player and can really teach he has the patience and is very understanding attend his class try your hardest and you will do fine there is nothing to worry about he is a great gifted teacher love him
9642,Steven  Jones,mr jones is a gifted instructor he is knowledgable friendly approachable and easy to undestand the very first day he is kind of scary and seems closedminded but i think just a show to make his point he is always helpful i wish he taught other music classes as well we are very lucky to be able to take classes from such a great teacher for so little money
9643,Steven  Jones,this is the guy you go to when you want to kick ass if your not ready stay away he will tear you up
9644,Steven  Jones,steve was the first actual guitar teacher i ever had he has lots of patience and is very helpful will somebody please put a red chili under his name already he is the best
9645,Steven  Jones,the man is very informative on guitar technique he will be the best guitar instructor you will ever have discriminate on playing ability he helps everyone who tries their best he kinda looks like the treat williams the dad on everwood
9646,Steven  Jones,easy and really helpful teacher if you want to learn take him i mean for people who are stubborn or think they know already how to play guitar think again this class is classical guitar and he teaches the standard method strict positioning fingering notes etc
9647,Steven  Jones,really good teacher pretty funny and very helpful if you have any problems playing he will help you solve them easy going guy with lots of professional music experience which is very helpful for someone who wants to grow as a player and performer highly recomended
9648,Steven  Jones,started playing guitar when he was yrs old amazing
9649,Steven  Jones,this guy is awesome he was very helpful and patient
9650,McClain,to many students his class were hard honestly he was a pretty good professor and always tried to give some advice concerning our future and goals just study hard and you will get what you deserve
9651,McClain,great teacher you just have to study students hate him because they dont read the book so they have a hard time in the class
9652,McClain,this teacher is hard he to trick you on tests there is a lot of outside homework i wound not take this class he makes students feel dumb for asking questions and there is a pretty big paper you have to do
9653,McClain,he is really strict and the tests are extremely difficult and he like any students who come late do not take his course
9654,McClain,he makes econ look like rocket science ever take him for a ge course only if you are an econ major
9655,Chris  Boucher,i took his native american history class for credit and enjoyed it so much that i came back for us hist dr boucher is an awesome teacher and i genuinely learned a lot from him
9656,Chris  Boucher,dr boucher seems to be a nice person that wants his students to do well however he expects a great load of work and participation in class as an incoming freshman i managed to do pretty well in all of my other classes except this one it felt like more of a philosophy class that was set up for failure rather than a normal history class
9657,Chris  Boucher,dr boucher is super personable and nice his history lectures are interesting even thoough not a huge fan of european history really funny as well you definitely need to read the books he assigns as you have quizzes on them but for the most part not much quizzing on stuff he posts online unless he talks about it in class
9658,Chris  Boucher,love this guy the american west is a very interesting course however his class is solely based on readings and discussion make sure you read read read and you will do fine
9659,Chris  Boucher,awesome dude i got a decent grade even though i skipped a bunch tough grader but hot accent would recommend
9660,Chris  Boucher,he probably only has clarity and funny going for him his class requires to be fully engaged and participating every class in order for him to like you if you participating in his mind you trying and it seems like he grades your things even harsher for those who just like to listen and can learn without having to participate gl
9661,Chris  Boucher,boucher is a really chill funny guy he knows his lectures can get boring so he cracks jokes and gets off topic sometimes to make things more interesting you have to take a lot of notes so hard to know what you have to study but horrible at history and never read but i still got a b
9662,Chris  Boucher,he takes this class way to serious to the point where obnoxious it be that hard for a his116 class exams are all based on lectures and he give any slides notes are all vocal do not take if other possibilities
9663,Chris  Boucher,sets of essays a few reading quizes can chose to not write final paper i wrote the final paper and he bumped me up from a to an a go to office hours and get him to read over your papers no tests super funny
9664,Chris  Boucher,papers quizes harsh paper grader never felt like they were that bad go to office hours and let him read them before turning in quizes are all on reading but he gives you a heads up beforehand class was kinda boring unless he got off topic loved his accent though would recommend but he is hard on papers
9665,Chris  Boucher,very nice helpful and fair definitely take advantage of his office hours if you need them very helpful a lot of reading assignments but they always necessary and you learn a ton one midterm term paper hard paper grader a final a few quizzes definitely recommend him he is great he makes the class
9666,Chris  Boucher,hilarious guy boring class the entire class was in christopher columbus take home midterm all essay but the final was multiple choice a really tough paper grader i often felt my papers were not nearly as bad as he scored them
9667,Chris  Boucher,great guy very enthusiastic always cracking jokes as previously noted very nice would take him if you can
9668,Chris  Boucher,by far the most helpful teacher had at college of charleston super nice and super helpful very enthusiastic about what he teaches and really wants to see his students do well and enjoy the class if you pay attention take notes and participate you will do just fine
9669,Chris  Boucher,dr boucher is an excellent lecturer and is great about meeting during office hours his class only has takehome exams quizzes and a final exams are on the readings and are graded harshly the quizzes are on class notes attendance is listed in syllabus but he rarely passes around a roll sheet
9670,Chris  Boucher,boucher is probably one of my favorite professors i did not like the idea of modern history but he made it fun i never read the book and aside from the paper i never did any outside work and i averaged a yes he is pretty attractive also very encouraging and helpful if you need it
9671,Chris  Boucher,i had such a crush great guy useless course he was the only reason i went
9672,Chris  Boucher,wonderful teacher enjoyed his lectures he gives a hard exam but so willing to help you improve go to his office hours very friendly and engaging
9673,Chris  Boucher,probably one of best professors had so far extremely helpful and really cares about his grades the lectures too bad he makes some cheesy jokes but all good fun his class was the first history class i actually liked going to it too hard just take legit notes and you should be fine
9674,Chris  Boucher,real nice guy and is really helpful if you go after class to see him cracks some good jokes in class to break up the boredom at times lots of optional work that kind of helps out on tests the tests are extremely hard though i would say avoid if you want your gpa to stay where it is at
9675,Peter  Foreman,like others have said class is extremely workload heavy expect a paper test or project due weekly but foreman really knows his stuff and wants you to succeed if you put the work gives out so much extra credit that impossible to fail and getting an a or b is doable if you care about learning take this professor
9676,Peter  Foreman,foreman really knows his stuff and is beyond knowledgeable about the subject matter the class is very workload heavy with weekly case analyses exams and group projects foreman is a hard grader with high expectations of his students be prepared to spend many long nights typing papers and conducting very indepth case analyses
9677,Peter  Foreman,dr foreman is a teacher that actually cares about your education if you do the material can be difficult but if you put in the effort and study you can get an a he is easy to listen to during lectures and the coursework for me was very interesting pretty funny guy too
9678,Peter  Foreman,although he is a tough grader everything you need is provided either go off of his powerpoints for papers or go in for help he is one of the most accommodating professors for those who go in to ask for help or with questions i bombed a paper but was able to learn from it and got nothing but or higher for the rest of the semester
9679,Peter  Foreman,class is not easy by any means multiple papers and group projects not to mention that foreman is a pretty harsh grader however there is so much extra credit that impossible not to pass do good on a few assignments and still pulled off an a
9680,Peter  Foreman,i would definitely recommend foreman the three week summer course was a lot of work but the class is discussion based so as long as you read the case studies you are fine he is very laid back and entertaining there is a lot of writing and analysis in this course but as long as he is seeing you are putting forth effort your grade will be fine
9681,Peter  Foreman,i took a week summer course with foreman the class was brutal and i recommend the summer course foreman is a great guy knowledgeable entertaining and fair but one of the toughest profs for this class you will do about case studies have tests group projects and a presentation if you do all of the work foreman will pass you
9682,Peter  Foreman,this class is not hard to pass but it is hard to tolerate this man is impossible to listen to and brutal to meet with in his office you will learn some interesting material and read some good cases but be prepared to use a thesaurus in class if you want to understand him
9683,Peter  Foreman,one of the best professors i have had i would recommend him over any mqm teacher people who complain about this class are those who like definitive and struggle to think outside the box he may grade you lower but there are so many points that it is impossible to not get at least a
9684,Peter  Foreman,very good teacher its impossible to get anything lower than a b if you actually put forth effort alot of papers and group work but by far the best teacher to choose for this senior level class
9685,Peter  Foreman,great teacher lecturing is at a minimum he wants to know he has your attention and you are learning many students go to him for encouragement he cares about his students one problem the topic of the class opportunism is and businesses will want employees who follow the fundamental rules rather than opportunities to exploit
9686,Peter  Foreman,class was a lot of work for not many points at begining of semester but he gives alot of extra credit opportunities end of semester there are alot of points left but actually learn the material so it isnt difficult getting the points
9687,Peter  Foreman,by far the best professor i have had yesthere is a lot of work and yes the class is hard but he goes above and beyond trying to do what he can to help his students understand he gives lots of extra credit and help he has a great way of relating to his students he is passionate about what he does and his work reflects that
9688,Peter  Foreman,overall tough class lots of group work and has you read a lot of cases back end loads the course so that most the points are at the very end if you work well with others its not hard to do the presentations but he does like to favor the girls for participation points he was an ok teacher but grades very harshly
9689,Peter  Foreman,he that bad for business organ we had a lot of assingments and tests plus we had group projects so there is a lot of points you can get he curved everything we got back i would totally reckomend him for evadently not for the upper level classes he was nice to our class and we got out on time
9690,Peter  Foreman,arrogant arrogant arrogant this man is possibly the most arrogant assh ever met in my entire life and has zero people skills and basically admit when he makes a mistake absolutely no help arrives late to class yet has expectations that you are on time and professional when he clearly is not he should be fired immediately
9691,Peter  Foreman,this guy is a complete try to switch out of his class if at all possible everything that everyone has said below is true and for me it was even more he has no respect for his students or their lives and thinks that his class should revolve around him
9692,Peter  Foreman,homework always returned late class of and have to wait weeks sometimes kept classes late our last one was minutes late for many assignments he sent out another page of clarifications due to the ambiguous nature of the first set of directions sometimes when you had already completed the work or only had hours left to do so
9693,Peter  Foreman,the guy was an arrogant conceited jerk and the entire mba class full of adults all had that opinion of him he deducted participation points even if you had to leave the room to go to the bathroom one person left the room due to having a coughing fit and he deducted points he is in love with himself and loved to brag about his bmw to the class
9694,Peter  Foreman,no comments
9695,Karen  Debalbian,in all honesty karen is not all that bad granted she leaves comments and does seem like a stickler but shes ok finished the class with a and i feel that she helped my writing out a lot i would recommend her class however it is very work intensive even for an online class
9696,Karen  Debalbian,this lady has a huge ego problem she doesnt respond to emails when you have a question and when she does get around to them she treats you as if you are an idiot i have never been treated so poorly by a teacher in my life honestly take this class because if you get on her bad side she will be bias worst professor at ncc period
9697,Karen  Debalbian,this women is a total nut she is nasty unclear and arrogant she doesnt treat you like an equal and leaves unprofessional comments in her emails she is late with grading and refuses to answer questions without getting mad or making you look stupid i wouldnt reccomend this professor at all im an a i think this lady is an airhead
9698,Karen  Debalbian,awesome class lots of intense work but it pays off my writing improved greatly
9699,Karen  Debalbian,the most stimulating teacher i have ever had has given lots of to deserving students
9700,Karen  Debalbian,she seems to really care about her students and to enjoy what she does my writing has really improved after taking her class
9701,Karen  Debalbian,just had you weeks so far and i think your a good english teacher
9702,Karen  Debalbian,i think karen is a very good teacher she is very clear in what she wants done and she can make a challange interesting
9703,Jay  Ko,took this class online and it was very easy as long as you do the homework and practice exams it is an easy a
9704,Jay  Ko,tough grade do well on tests
9705,Jay  Ko,great teacher and is straight foward i have had several math professors at parkland and he is the best i have had good amounts of homework but not strenous quizzes and tests are very clear and are similar to what you are actually studying in class
9706,Jay  Ko,tried taking this class online dropped after the first exam that i flunked never answered emails for help told me to go to tutoring center for help i took online since i am a working adult and take oncampus course never felt like could keep up with the online program and work i am an a student but was going to flunk if drop
9707,Jay  Ko,jay is a straight forward professor he teaches for concepts not for memorization which is helpful he is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students there are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work
9708,Jay  Ko,good teacher
9709,Jay  Ko,he is probably the funniest teacher ever does a great job explaining concepts but take too well to questions he has a low tolerance for selfexplanatory questions because he expects highly from people in calc ii but it is definitely worth taking especially from jay ko
9710,Jay  Ko,jay ko told us one the first day of class if you pass this class with me you be taking it he give you all quiz answers in the lecture and the test are comprised of the quizzes
9711,Jay  Ko,jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of calculus ii concepts he is extremely funny and always engaging during class the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable
9712,Jay  Ko,it was much easier paying attention in class jay he keeps things entertaining his tests are very standard he is more worried about understanding concepts than memorizing equations
9713,Jay  Ko,must take do hw lecture examples extra problems and your golden
9714,Jay  Ko,jay ko cuts through pompous textbook explanations and teaches the essential knowledge he will not pamper you though and i think that made a lot of people drop the section i will take him again for calc
9715,Jay  Ko,jay ko will not pamper you he will teach you to destroy math though i will be taking him for calc
9716,Jay  Ko,his lectures are pretty straight forward and easy to follow he likes to give out exam related problems during the lecture so best to show up he grades a bit harder than most but you will do fine if you do the recommended problems and show up to class
9717,Jay  Ko,he basically gives the type of questions that are asked on the exams and final he mainly just takes questions from hw and lecture notes and just changes them a bit so if you understand the concept your fine it is important that you come to his classes on time
9718,Jay  Ko,awful impatient and not helpful
9719,Jay  Ko,if u are taking his math class its easy he is a good guy keep using some bad jokes in his class a little harsh about test his homework is not too much he said he did not like or class maybe thats y some people didnt feel good about their class
9720,Jay  Ko,very good teacher if you want to learn math then look no farther he was a fan so we got alone but serious very good teacher teaches the bigger picture in math exams and quizzes can be tricky tho i would recommend him for any math class if you really want to learn the material
9721,Jay  Ko,i think he was a great teacher he was helpful when you asked the thing i liked the most is that his lecture notes are straight forward what you see in the lecture notes is what you will see on the test i personally recommend him even though some would say otherwise he gives lots of examples and explains very well
9722,Jay  Ko,pretty good teacher in the truest sense of the word not very nice when you ask questions however most of his meanness is said jokingly he is very clear in what he wants his tests are pretty hard
9723,Brandy  Zito,very annoying voice she will get very easily upset with a class and will baby you in gba the material in the class is what makes it super easy study skills how to use university resources etc so the class is dumb anyways
9724,Brandy  Zito,i had an a at midterm and then she lost my papers after taking a leave of absence for over a week right before finals i can only imagine her do all of her grading and getting your grade changed is a hassle as she never replies to calls or emails being a professor is clearly not her job so beware
9725,Brandy  Zito,brandy zito frost has no business being a college professor her class is a joke and a retarded monkey could teach it she also needs to take the word absolutely out of her vocabulary seriously she never returned phone calls or emails and after months of this when i went to her office she obviously could not communicate she made me w
9726,Brandy  Zito,mrs frost is my advisor and she is very refreshing to deal with most of the cba advisors that dealt with shoot straight with you and some of them just act like halfwits brandy however will get right to the point and tell you everything you need to know also very nice
9727,Brandy  Zito,no comments
9728,Brandy  Zito,super easy class however i had a major project that misreported it brought down my grade from an to a b she made retribution but it took more than months for the grade to be changed and became a huge hassel found that after the c
9729,Brandy  Zito,brandy got married and is now brandy zito frost you have to work in this class there are several projects but everything you do benefits you personally and professionally it is not just busywork i strongly encourage everyone to take this class it is helpful and brandy is the best
9730,Brandy  Zito,she is an excellent teacher her test are pretty straight forward with no stings attached just that good
9731,Brandy  Zito,wow an awesome teacher a motivational class that helps focus your goals career plans thanks mrs zito
9732,Brandy  Zito,she is awesome i would recommend her to everyone
9733,Brandy  Zito,take it she really cares about her students
9734,Brandy  Zito,no comments
9735,Philippe  Bossaers,i took his online intro to statistics class he leave feedback on problems miss in order to tell me what i was doing wrong so have to commute to college to talk to him in person
9736,Philippe  Bossaers,i had him for calc i would definitely choose him as a prof again homework mandatory which means quizzes and exams are the only thing he grades i study as much as i should have and when final exams came i struggled easy to understand and helpful outside of class if you show up to class you have any problems
9737,Philippe  Bossaers,i really like this professor one of the best math teachers at parkland he teaches with students and not down to them and always encourages questions and tries to answer them the best he can very pleasant guy to be around and found his grading to be very fair diff eq is a tough class but he wants you to succeed
9738,Philippe  Bossaers,i personally do not care for this professor because of his teaching style he only gives grades on quizzes and exams so if you do well on those then you really redeem yourself his homework required to turn in but recommended for practice he is a very tough grader
9739,Philippe  Bossaers,i had this professor for my stats class in all honesty i struggled a bit but with a lot of studying outside of class i managed to pull an a thank god he was a kind teacher who did care for my grade and if you put in the extra effort will reward you greatly he gave lots of opportunities to better test scores
9740,Philippe  Bossaers,if you come to class and take notes you will have no probably passing the class it is important to study for the test and quizzes because thats the only grades you will recieve the homework is optional if you study your notes you will have no problem passing the test or quiz you have to be willing to put the time in to study to pass
9741,Philippe  Bossaers,statistics i liked phil as a professor he went over examples in class that looked exactly like what he puts on the quizzes and tests so your notes are basically the only thing you need to use to study for this class he is very consistent on tests and quizzes which is why i would definitely recommend him
9742,Philippe  Bossaers,i took calc as a freshman in highschool math was my best subject he did not do well at explaining why he was doing things he would just go through examples by far the worst teacher i have ever had do not take his class there are other teachers that offer calculus and i have heard much much better things about him
9743,Philippe  Bossaers,best math teacher ever had i took calc in high school so this was a refresher course in a way i did horrible in high school so i needed to relearn it but he went over an enormous amount of examples and was easily accessible so open for questions i wish he taught at the university
9744,Philippe  Bossaers,disliked this professor tried extremely hard in the class and did not do so well on the final because of problems outside of the classroom and he lowered my grade to a c even though i had earned a b in the class as far as percentage wise makes you sign a contract that says he can do this awful
9745,Philippe  Bossaers,easy to understand fair in grading and very helpful also very attractive
9746,Philippe  Bossaers,very clear and helpful but a really tough grader
9747,Philippe  Bossaers,very well organized easy to understand helpful with great examples
9748,Philippe  Bossaers,ok this teacher was extremely not helpful at all his powerpoint lectures provided would always have mistakes in them confusing the students on how to work the problem correctly teacher was easy to get a hold of but if you got a problem wrong because of his error tough luck
9749,Philippe  Bossaers,his lectures are a little boring however he makes math to be candy and is very helpful especially in office hours
9750,Philippe  Bossaers,only b i ever got in math should have gotten a c but i still at him about not giving me an a very tough subject calc got a clue
9751,Philippe  Bossaers,great teacher easy grader i should not have passed this class with a c
9752,Philippe  Bossaers,this is a clear cut do the work ask questions when you need to and get a good grade guy fair funny and good in a subject a lot of teachers are not
9753,Philippe  Bossaers,highly recommended excellent teacher the lecture is fun he takes time to make sure everyone is on track the homework overwhelming and he is pretty hilarious i really see how anyone like phil unless they fall into the work got poor grade must be fault not mine category
9754,Philippe  Bossaers,phil is awesome he spoon feeds you all you need to do is put in the numbers from the problem on the test is it was on your homework itll be like on the test you just need to study the process people who dislike him are extremely lazy
9755,Dave  Heggem,he is an awesome down to earth guy he is willing to help if you have problems the best professor i have ever had he cares a great deal about his students i totally recommend him for a professor for an easy
9756,Dave  Heggem,super easy nice guy
9757,Dave  Heggem,he is a very straightforward teacher he wants us to do well and not fool around if you do all of your assignments and attend class you will make an not hard at all you even stay the whole class most times easy a
9758,Dave  Heggem,great guy
9759,Dave  Heggem,he is a really nice guy and is willing to do anything to help you be successful in your college career the class is an easy a if you do what he asks yu to do and you go to class
9760,Dave  Heggem,he is a generally a nice guy and i think he really does have intentions of truly helping you
9761,Dave  Heggem,really nice you have to do the assignments though but they hard at all great class
9762,Dave  Heggem,easy way to get hour
9763,Dave  Heggem,boring ass class he drones on and on about bs the whole time considering i almost never go and still have a pass its when your sitting in class it feels like when a cop talks to you if you did something bad and about how bad it was god he is boring
9764,Dave  Heggem,very easy class you really have assignments except for things like when u of a has like a career fair you will be asked to stop by the quad and get brochures of careers you are interested in and then you have to type a resume at the end of the course but it is very simple all you have to do is go and he is a nice man
9765,Dave  Heggem,awesome guy and easy to get along with
9766,Dave  Heggem,he is a real peoples person who has went to college himself great stand up guy and straight forward person great man easy a
9767,Dave  Heggem,no comments
9768,Jeff  Bernhardt,he is not very clear when giving assignments and he have good people skills at all seems very nervous when teaching and treats students like little kids not good with controlling the classroom do not take course
9769,Jeff  Bernhardt,tough grader
9770,Jeff  Bernhardt,horrible teacher does not teach anything just hands out assignment sheets and gives too much time in class to work paces back and forth across frot of room talking to the wall insetad of the students even when answering a question stutters over every word and seems extremely nervous even in a small class.avoid him if you get bored easliy
9771,Jeff  Bernhardt,nice guy but not a big fan of the class

9774,Thomas  Schnarre,great professor if you do the work and post on the discussion boards you will do just fine he outlines clearly what is expected in papers and if you follow what he tells you to do not only will you get good grades but the papers are easy to write
9775,Thomas  Schnarre,iv taken two online classes with thom and have nothing but success in both of these classes he is very understanding and flexibility on late work although i was in condensed classes over the summer i feel rushed
9776,Thomas  Schnarre,i have taken classes with him awsome teacher makes class fun and different than others gives you plenty of time to work on papers papers are not long but detailed follow directions to a t
9777,Thomas  Schnarre,i have taken classes with him before but not online and loved it his online course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring lack of communication and very difficult to contact
9778,Thomas  Schnarre,excellent professor this is the second course that i took with professor schnarre intentionally very fair and keeps you entertained
9779,Thomas  Schnarre,if you pay attention turn work in on time and follow his instructions you will breeze by he as a wonderful professor and keeps class entertaining
9780,Thomas  Schnarre,he is a really funny and good guy and i like his personality class was also cancelled a cancelled a couple time so that was nice the in class workdays are optional so if you want to go on those days you have to the feedback he gives is confusing and the answers he gives very straight forward sometimes
9781,Thomas  Schnarre,he is very picky about his papers and if you have one thing wrong in mla style he will take alot of points off good luck i finished with a b but it was hard to get the b
9782,Thomas  Schnarre,terrible teacher at least online completely unwilling to actually help anytime you ask for help he just refers you back to his online content and accuses you of not doing any of your assigned reading i tried to meet with him at his office and he basically told me no his feedback was clear when asking for help rude and disrespectful
9783,Thomas  Schnarre,very specific on his grading material and really goes into depth on what should be included in your papers to make page count and write good content very approachable and has a lively attitude loves his job only down side is he critique papers at all if already a good writer easy class and great prof overall
9784,Thomas  Schnarre,this class was tough i pulled numerous allnighters to be able to pass but he did help me become a much better writer for the future and with taking i have to take anymore english classes on my final i thought i did really good but he marked me down and till this day i know why
9785,Thomas  Schnarre,if you listen and follow directions and ask for feedback thom is really helpful i am a better writer nok
9786,Thomas  Schnarre,pretty clear class he wants what he wants but gives you feedback on drafts in class and spends a lot of times making sure you understand stuff
9787,Thomas  Schnarre,get ready to step outside your comfort zone and open your mind to learn new ways of seeing things he allows you to test out ideas and theories through writing if you are a good writer on top of that you will ace the class and enjoy it immensely however the minute you close your mind is the minute you have set yourself up to fail this class
9788,Thomas  Schnarre,there are only actual assignments and then participation points so if you do well on a few things you are really screwed i never knew what he really wanted from me because his feedback is awful when you submit your rough drafts slow to respond to emails and when he does he answer half your questions anyways
9789,Thomas  Schnarre,thom is a very interesting guy be prepared for that most of all his subjects in my opinion are a little dated but they are pretty easy to write about a tough grader but if you know how to write this class will be a breeze just be prepared to work at it
9790,Thomas  Schnarre,a lot of effort is needed to pass his class
9791,Thomas  Schnarre,this was an online section and some complained that the site was hard to follow i think they read the stuff if you do and really pay attention you can do fine he wants what he wants give it to him
9792,Thomas  Schnarre,he fine tunes your stuff no big revelations about writing except it takes time and lots of drafts to come up with good stuff very reasonalbe in research component funny guy
9793,Thomas  Schnarre,thom wants what he wants and is fair and resonable he allows you to write on any topic so some of the peer stuff is interesting but cool to have that freedom good input
9794,J.W.  Morrissette,great teacher he should be cloned enthusiastic very funny knowledgeable encouraging take his class you regret it
9795,J.W.  Morrissette,one of the best acting teachers around enormously helpful without getting creepy funny to a point that it is hard to focus on the actual class ask him about his cocktail phrases
9796,J.W.  Morrissette,best teacher ever
9797,J.W.  Morrissette,soo funny and enjoyable to work with brilliant
9798,J.W.  Morrissette,no comments
9799,Asif  Zaidi,he is a very well intentioned man and very smart but he has a lot of trouble getting ideas across and there is minimal organization if any for the labs most of the lab is spent on tedious things and you come out frustrated
9800,Asif  Zaidi,no comments
9801,Asif  Zaidi,trust me this man doesnt know how to teach i wonder how he got into teaching isnt very good at explaining things bad

9809,Pat  Sawyer,great teacher i will strongly any student to take her class
9810,Pat  Sawyer,sawyers course makes me sigh i made the move to more online courses due to the outrageous costs of driving daily on multiple accounts to campus i thought i would get the same learning experience i was wrong the course can be done without reading a single chapter nearly all discussions are opinion supported tests are even linear to the book
9811,Pat  Sawyer,had prof sawyer three times and all classes were amazingly easy online classes even more so class consists of a weekly discussion that you can answer with your own personal experiences or opinion we had tests which all the answers are in order in the book easiest a ever get
9812,Pat  Sawyer,i had her for an online class it was great weekly discussion postings pretty much all opinion a total of tests never read a single chapter all you have to do is follow the chapter shes testing on with the test its self all her questions are in order on the book incredibly easy teacher very nice too
9813,Pat  Sawyer,easy a for a traditional campus course took her again online the next semester for a different psyce course and she was just as good easy a if your willing to put in the time
9814,Pat  Sawyer,excellent teacher had her for online class she watches your online activity strict on due dates and alittle confusing syllabus if you do the work on time and do all she requires easy a i strongly recommend her also excellent in responding in emails giving grades ect
9815,Pat  Sawyer,i have had her for three classes and all three she has been a wonderful professor she cares about the subject matter the students and is up to date with current facts and knowledge i would highly recommend her her tests that hard and easy to pass if you try i would take another class of hers in a heartbeat
9816,Pat  Sawyer,fabulous professor i highly recommend her she is the best
9817,Pat  Sawyer,she was awesome the class was fast paced because it was over the summer but she really knew what she was talking about she made sure everyone understood before we moved on which not many professors do
9818,Pat  Sawyer,this is a wonderful teacher she really cares about her subject she makes class interesting sharing real life experiences she also grades very fairly i recommend her highly
9819,Pat  Sawyer,no comments
9820,Pat  Sawyer,professor sawyer is probably the best teacher at the college she is very thorough and covers all the material so students can understand it she provides handouts and is extremely helpful to students who need extra assistance definitely a professor to take for psychology she is clearly an asset to middlesex
9821,Pat  Sawyer,best teacher ever sawer is not only a great teacher but also a great and genuine persontake her classes you will be happy you did
9822,Freda  Decerbo,at first intimidating but once you actually began class awesome never had a better instructor she brings in alot of outside content that relates to the work
9823,Freda  Decerbo,mrs decerbo is a really good teacher at first i so sure how i would like her but she is actually quite funny you need to be in class to understand some of the topics she is helpful and brings in some great guest speakers love her
9824,Freda  Decerbo,absolutely terrible yelling at students is not the way to teach students she also goes off on tangents to rant about her personal life even though it has nothing to do with the class content
9825,Freda  Decerbo,people seem to either love or hate her she knows her psychology but she tends to at her students and she know my name until more than half way through the semester she did bring in some great speakers though
9826,Freda  Decerbo,this is the best professor i have ever had she is extremely knowledgeable and does everything to give that knowledge to her students information i learned there has lasted throughout my entire college career she is a great friend and cares about the lives of her students both in and out of the classroom take her class it will impact your life
9827,Freda  Decerbo,sweet
9828,Freda  Decerbo,funny
9829,Freda  Decerbo,good speakers
9830,Freda  Decerbo,had to work knew her stuff
9831,Freda  Decerbo,knows her stuff makes you work funny cares about humor in the class lots of speakers and videos real life applications
9832,Freda  Decerbo,she is a very informative teacher who really tries to push her students the class is tough but it is worth it the quizzes and tests are difficult but that helps teach she does move through the chapters really quickly but she does have movies and speakers that help with it
9833,Freda  Decerbo,gave out a lot of extra credits i thought she was pretty easy but then again i love psychology
9834,Freda  Decerbo,did not like her at all you had to do many response papers that had to be like words or something redic like that and you had to go to a nursing home and for a research project like it

9838,Julie  Weishar,she seems very on organized imformation on speeches is all over between the internet and the handouts i often got marked off for not using the write bullet points easy class though but recommend it
9839,Julie  Weishar,b
9840,Julie  Weishar,this class was a tough one but if you were dedicated and did the work it too bad she gave detailed explanations on what you did wrong and how you could improve on projects she was also very helpful when i came and saw her she understood my problems with group members and worked with me to fix them bewareshe will talk your head off
9841,Julie  Weishar,she was awsome her class was very hard but it was rewarding at the end of the semester she did a lot to help my public speaking i would reccomend her to any person if they want to better themselves in the area of public speaking
9842,Julie  Weishar,yes she is veery conservative but the class is not that hard choose well your topics and be fine midterm and final are easy
9843,Julie  Weishar,she did a good job teaching the class the midterms and final were not at all over what she taught in class also i agree with the other people who said that if she disagrees with your topic she knocks your grade down expect an unbiased grade in this class if you work hard you should get an a though
9844,Julie  Weishar,she made me laugh
9845,Julie  Weishar,the worst teacher i have ever had in my life do not take a class with her she grades you wether or not you agree with what she has to say if you like george bush do not take this class she is big fan and if you give a democratic speech ur gonna be in trouble

9848,Richard  Fern,you have to read your textbook you have to study fern does as good a job teaching as anyone could do in the limited class time ther is take full advantage of the cheatsheet that is allowed for the tests by typing in size font with formulas and examples and it is critical to your grade that you attempt all problems of the hw right or wrong
9849,Richard  Fern,avoid taking this with you will fail lectures are not very thorough he go into detail you will do homework and be randomly called upon for the homework tests are extremely difficult be prepared to teach yourself like all acc classes at eku
9850,Richard  Fern,extremely helpful if you are worried about taking accounting this is the man to take it from
9851,Richard  Fern,high workload however homework assigned directly connects to content if you have a really good case on a bad question he will listen like his class the exam questions comes from the textbook publisher and therefore is very picky you have to read because you get quizzed on reading before you are taught
9852,Richard  Fern,he thinks you need to teach yourself there were many times a student would ask a question and dr fern would answer then later send an email saying he was wrong about the answer about of the class has a c or lower i hated him as a teacher i am going to change colleges because of him because i am an accounting major
9853,Richard  Fern,dr fern was a difficult teacher but i learned a lot in his classes except for individual tax i see how i passed since i failed each exam but i took my c and went on to the next class ever take and together i failed because of that and the second time around was so much better i passed it with a b
9854,Richard  Fern,definately makes you work but truly one of the best profs had he really knows his material and enjoys teaching it he was always willing to help if you were willing to put in the time
9855,Richard  Fern,very very hard professor he always gives way too much homework and made us feel stupid
9856,Richard  Fern,he does give a lot of work you have homework problems and group problems that can be very time consuming i suggest not to take both classes at the same time he does really care about the students and is very willing to help them learn he taught me more than any other professor ever had do the work and pay attention and be fine
9857,Richard  Fern,definitely works students hard lots of homework and long hand written tests will add points back though if you meet with him about your test very nice teacher just wants you to learn
9858,Richard  Fern,veryy hard too much work had him for a summer class and every night was hours of homework with little help
9859,Richard  Fern,absolutely the hardest prof had very difficult exams too bad he is a musttake
9860,Hugh  Afshari,highly intelligent and interesting professor be professional and participate as well as willing to learned something their is no right or wrong answer so be involve and have fun doing it the class will only be as hard as you make it i will definitely take his class again honestly enjoyed every moment while able to take with me some knowledge
9861,Hugh  Afshari,makes the subject matter more interesting than many other professors can down to earth and understanding professor loves to play advocate during open discussions so take his comments personally much better class than expected
9862,Hugh  Afshari,professor hugh very funny and smart man his class consists of papers only no tests and as long as you put your life experiences and emotions on paper correlating itto the material he will give you a good grade he is a very easy grader oh no phones in class
9863,Hugh  Afshari,prof h afshari was extrermenly helpful vey interesting man to listen has seen and been through alot definetly learn alot in his class
9864,Hugh  Afshari,i was really excited coming into this class but after weeks of listening to prof rambling and boasting of how amazing he is my interest in this class dropped immensely papers easy discussions useless videos awesome he likes to pick on people and argue with them and god forbid you yawn or say only take him if necessary
9865,Hugh  Afshari,professor afshari is a great person he was fun relevant and has an awesome sense of humor a very wise man who has led an eventful life we had great discussions after class i learned a lot from him
9866,Hugh  Afshari,very funny other people have said it say it too keep an open mind if you like to argue you better come very prepared you do learn a lot about his personal history which i found motivating rather than offending i learned a lot and would take his class agian
9867,Hugh  Afshari,keep an open mind
9868,Hugh  Afshari,hugh is hillarious but can be offensive if you are a softy he is an easy grader and has a healthy sense of self not modest
9869,Hugh  Afshari,good professor interesting and helpful he does go off on tangents though but his stories are good
9870,Hugh  Afshari,this guy is great he provoked me to think about things in a way that was uncomfortable sometimes i wanted to get up and walk out but that is philosophy in demonstration some were put off by his wry sense of humor but if you are smart enough to figure him out he is actually hilarious
9871,Hugh  Afshari,well intitially he seemed intelligent and methodical but quickly it changed with his constant boasting about his iq and his presitgious status he rarely was able to find time to speak about philosophy i felt the purpose of the class was to belittle the students and to glorify his self i strongly recommend not taking any class he teaches
9872,Hugh  Afshari,professor afshari is very smart will study you while you speek and be careful do not talk in his hear any little sound overall i would take him in future courses
9873,Hugh  Afshari,hugh is a great professor and is easy on grading
9874,Hugh  Afshari,great teacher he went off on tangents but they were great stories and he was a smart man definately recommend him
9875,Hugh  Afshari,funny teacher not very clear on what you have to do in class though i would take him again
9876,Hugh  Afshari,very educated knowledgable man the class i had with him was phl100 good class i appreciated his professional character
9877,Hugh  Afshari,i loved this lot of work but well worth leave his class wanted to be a better person for you and your kids very intelligent and has had an interesting and eventful life you see only in the movies truly a person one aspires tbe
9878,Hugh  Afshari,excellent teacher had him for enviorn ethics very logical mind dry yet funny sense of humor
9879,Hugh  Afshari,great teacher good sense of humor and really makes you see things from both sides prepare to work and do your reading
9880,G. Creighton  Frampton,classes are very oldfashioned but he still seems to spark my interest just read his chapter before class you will totally get his referenced witty jokes
9881,G. Creighton  Frampton,easy teacher give any homework or any tests only gave one because he had to he said even read your answer on the test if its long he says even pay attention if you show up to class talks and rambles the whole time but easy
9882,G. Creighton  Frampton,a nice person lectures without any powerpoint slides notes or anything gives you scenarios while teaching but is unclear what will be on the exam you basically have to teach yourself buy the book and read it you have to in order to pass the class
9883,G. Creighton  Frampton,frampton was awesome but you basically teach yourself and basically have two tests a final and mid term so fail them and its an easy a
9884,G. Creighton  Frampton,lectures the entire time buy the textbook because going to have to make notes and teach yourself
9885,G. Creighton  Frampton,yo frampton is dope coolest teacher you will ever have so helpful and friendly probably the best teacher at philau
9886,G. Creighton  Frampton,the man coolest guy ever such a nice person and very helpful
9887,G. Creighton  Frampton,great guy absolutely hysterical keeps class interesting which is a plus if you have an early class for such a basic not exactly crazy exciting class it went pretty smoothly definitely recommended
9888,G. Creighton  Frampton,such an easy teacher you even have to go to class just show up for the tests if you have a picture on your cover page of your papers get an definitely suggest taking him
9889,G. Creighton  Frampton,frampton is a great guy his class is hilarious and if you actually go to class an pay attention you will learn a lot his tests are multiple choice but you have to put time in studying for them the essays are really easy too all you need is pages and a really nice cover page and get an a
9890,G. Creighton  Frampton,best teacher ive ever had
9891,G. Creighton  Frampton,easy class attendance is not necessary at all he talks a lot n makes some jokes which can be disturbing sometimes but funny his test can be hard but the papers you have to write r a joke he grades them basically on the appearance of ur cover page if you want to learn anything about marketing tho this is not the class
9892,G. Creighton  Frampton,i have to comment about his pipe collection as well he is the man that lives in a pipe other than that take him if you want a professor to actually teach you a typical class starts with him complaining about how poorly his stocks are doing and then he might call roll followed by a quick scan of the chapter and maybe draw a picture
9893,G. Creighton  Frampton,this guy is def the man you dont need to go to class but make sure you show up for tests and do the papers the tests arent that hard since he tells you the essay questions and then the online quizzes help a lot
9894,G. Creighton  Frampton,no comments
9895,G. Creighton  Frampton,so easy put a nice cover page on your papers gauranteed a tests are easy the multiple choice questions come from the online quizzes and he gives you all the short answer questions in the class before the test he puts one diagram per test up on the board in class that isnt in the book so make sure you get it and just write alot on the essays
9896,G. Creighton  Frampton,this guy is the man go to class when you feel like it just read the book and do the online quizzes before the tests the papers are a joke too just make it look nice
9897,G. Creighton  Frampton,true you need to go to this class everything he teaches in this class on his tests just make sure you buy the book simply to use the cd he uses the tests from the cd and you can get the answers on the cd
9898,G. Creighton  Frampton,very easy and very cool always making jokes and keeps the class environment light and casual
9899,G. Creighton  Frampton,another student who only casually shows up i still did well in this class he is quite funny he gives out as on papers like going out of style and you actually can learn things if you show up and pay attention you do have to show up for surprise quizzes to get an a but easy
9900,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,ddht was the best class ever taken i enjoyed him in as well
9901,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,best professor at hands down
9902,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,soft spoken confusing and not so much tech savvy interns of lecture presenting and lecture recording
9903,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,he is very boring soft spoken and likes to ramble he talks so slowly yet quickly that hard to decipher the gibberish that he speaks his slides are not great either keep your studies to the textbook
9904,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,alright prof he speaks softly so sit closer to him pretty boring but his exam is fair i did alright on his section he gets questions x weeks teaching i read textbook for his section as his notes arent fantastic
9905,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,very nice prof with a warm shy smile i hope he talks louder and clearer i am not a native english speaker and have no idea what he talks about of the time he does try to be funny as i can see my classmates laugh from time to time but since i understand him i know what they are laughing about p

9918,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,cool and funny guy makes class enjoyable
9919,Patrick Martin  Petkovich,one of few profs here who actually tries to get students to enjoy the class
9920,John  Ferguson,dr f is the best he cares for each and every student that is sitting in front of him he has been so helpful to me throughout my stint here at eku he has been with me every step of the way he was also my adviser if you want to learn from the best take dr f he really is awesome
9921,John  Ferguson,dr ferguson is also my advisor he is one of the best if not the best teachers ever had in my life not because of the content he taught me but because of the life lessons he cares about his students more than we care about ourselves sometimes if you love pe sure you will after just a few conversations with him love him
9922,John  Ferguson,this mas has been teaching the same way for the last years and changed a thing during his time at eku once he hates you he will always hate you get on his bad side there is one way to learn in his mind and that is his way to stay awake in his class is a true challenge time to hang it up dr ferguson
9923,John  Ferguson,very nice professor and a super easy class you can take this class for two weeks in the summer we did an instant activity notebook and peer teaching and class was fun everyone got an a
9924,John  Ferguson,complete he picks a favorite in the class and hates everyone else would not recommend him unless he already loves you
9925,John  Ferguson,dr ferguson is a great teacher he really acts like he cares about the students and is always willing to help class is easy try to take it in the summer they offer a two week class with no tests super easy
9926,John  Ferguson,dr ferguson is an awesome teacher he knows his stuff and he makes his class very fun assingments are easy and he is very clear tests are easy if you look over notes no book was required he was the best teacher i have had yet i hated to see this class end if would love it if all classes were this way
9927,John  Ferguson,one of the sweetest people ever met know his stuff fun and enthusiastic great teacher
9928,John  Ferguson,i loved this class one of my favorites so far he is a great teacher and person assignments bad and there tests he is very nice and easy to get along with

9930,John  Ferguson,no comments
9931,John  Ferguson,wonderful teacher this class is very fun i would recommend him to anyone
9932,John  Ferguson,i loved this class it was a lot of fun and not a lot of bs busy work other teahcers give you
9933,John  Ferguson,not a fair grader shows a lot of bias
9934,John  Ferguson,excellent teacher very fun
9935,Suzanne  Gessner,i really have to contradict the earlier posting i think the person was actually writing about gessner she does teach she does not read things verbatim from the textbook she is very interesting and kept her students engaged and interested moreover she was the best instructor i had this semester
9936,Suzanne  Gessner,i really enjoyed her class she explained things clearly and efficiently she is very approachable and would even see me when there an office hour available i find her exams easy but i feel that we were well prepared for them i think uvic is extremely lucky to have her
9937,Suzanne  Gessner,great teacher very calm clear and approachable she is very helpful and makes herself available for students who have questions all in all a good experience
9938,Suzanne  Gessner,does not teach reads things things verbatim from the text book does not elaborate at all explainations seem to consistantly be circular does nothing to hold students interest it is absolutely painful having to sit through her class i would not wish this professor on anyone hands down the worst instructor i have ever had easy tests etc
9939,Suzanne  Gessner,does an excellent job of explaining concepts is approachable and is always very clear about what she wants done on assignments also knows how to pick good tas awesome prof awesome class d
9940,Suzanne  Gessner,very clear teacher very calm she conveys all the material in a straightforward manner she is approachable and open to questions she show a lot of passion for her subject but she certainly does a very good job teaching it
9941,Suzanne  Gessner,great teacher i loved this class there were a few topics she went through a little quickly but other than that she was very easy to understand
9942,Suzanne  Gessner,a great teacher very clear straightforward and fair
9943,Suzanne  Gessner,very nice person helpful kind concerned.good teacher cool

9947,Bill  Peterson,i really enjoyed taking this class you have to do the readings but he is very clear with what will be in the exams regarding lecture and what covered in class interesting approach to adult development he has or random days in which he will take attendance i recommend going to all lectures regardless they are very interesting
9948,Bill  Peterson,lectures are interesting his tests are very straightforward and the homework is minimal great professor and if you show up to class pay attention and read the textbook his class should be a breeze no surprises with him
9949,Bill  Peterson,mixes up of materials and mediums used to express material absolutely fabulous attentive to the needs of the students workload is just right and he provides support that is necessary through out the class he asks in the middle of the lecture if everything makes sense and provides time questions best professor at smith hands down
9950,Bill  Peterson,excellent professor organized test was comprehensive if you followed along in lectures experiments were fun and assignments went along with the class he is very accessible and office hours are great he was very nice and made a point of trying to get to know name the first day of class lab reports were long but facilitated learning
9951,Bill  Peterson,great professor lectures are organized and assignments are clear
9952,Bill  Peterson,one of the best psych professors at smith he is organized and engaged and always willing to meet with students his lectures and assignments are clear and organized so it is easy to study for his exams i never wanted to miss a class
9953,Bill  Peterson,he is amazing the lectures are really interesting the material diverse and he really makes you engaged in the material he is super helpful and flexible about papers etc you can tell he cares about the students if you take good notes and read the coursepack the tests will be easy dont read the text book its boring
9954,Bill  Peterson,great friendly organized professor really enjoyed his class
9955,Bill  Peterson,peterson is a great lecturer and is very aproachable he really wants his students to succeed i would definitely take this class if you can squeeze it in
9956,Bill  Peterson,pretty good interesting class i have pretty ambivalent feelings towards his lecturing style seemed a little too scripted at times which i like but the lectures were very organized
9957,Bill  Peterson,adult development is seriously a wonderful class i wish i had enough time to take all his classes
9958,Bill  Peterson,i loved him so much hes so great and approachable fair grader

9963,Bill  Peterson,enthusiastic and friendly
9964,Bill  Peterson,a great lecturer very clear and interesting also really friendly
9965,Paulo  Horta,unfair picks his favs a right answer is the one which he agrees with free thought is not allowed not a very fair marker avoid him
9966,Paulo  Horta,liked how he allows us to do creative responses to the novels found him very approachable and his lectures engaging and not boring at all especially because actually interested in the subject himself and conveys that to his students
9967,Paulo  Horta,really really dislike paulo ego takes up entire lecture hall jokes around at students expense all class read arabian nights wonderful material however he give more than a c to anyone who mentioned in any of their work should be valid in arabian nights as almost all women are picks favs very unfair avoid
9968,Paulo  Horta,you go to class to hear the same lecture worded differently discussions on fairly easy books simply touch the surface and nothing is indepth i think stupid although he acts like wellread and intelligent i hope he gets fired all you need to know is read across the globe i just saved you tons of and time welcome
9969,Paulo  Horta,great course one of the best professors at sfu i also took wl and was enjoyed it a lot might major in wl
9970,Paulo  Horta,after semester paulo decided to major in wl i have never met such a dedicated prof who is so passionate about what he teaches that students automatically become engaged in discussions i understand the nasty comments about him cause in the that had him none of the students in my classes ever felt that way about him
9971,Paulo  Horta,this was a fantastic class paulo knows the material through and through and is willing to give you the help you need i would take this class again in a second
9972,Paulo  Horta,prof horta is mean spirited his jokes are often not in good fun and he puts down students indirectly such as by mentioneing that he knows more langauges or something or how they read hamlet really etc ego and arrogance combine for a nasty effect but his course materials can be interesting and he marks fairly overall
9973,Paulo  Horta,horta is a nightmare the syllabus is he manages to make you hate coming to class as they are excruciating and boring as hell he blabbers on incoherently about everything else but the books flirst with students and gets most of his facts wrong.he teach just parades his ego although an easy class avoid if you value your sanity
9974,Paulo  Horta,loved reading dq and other books i mean quixote great course and excellent instructor
9975,Paulo  Horta,i did not enjoy the teaching of the instrucotr horta
9976,Paulo  Horta,i can only speak to the arabian nights course the best course i have taken so far at sfu the enthusiasm and passion were contagious there was no exam but only a journal of responses instead everyone was into it
9977,Paulo  Horta,this a softie pretty much have to skip class not do readings and not show up to the final to get into trouble
9978,Paulo  Horta,horrible i did not like this prof horta but course was neat
9979,Paulo  Horta,he is an okay prof he marks way too hard he is pretty arrogant i found his course too dificult i am a good student
9980,Paulo  Horta,great prof too bad he got promoted and is gone
9981,Paulo  Horta,worst prof at sfu i totally had a hard time listening to his bordenlineestoteric lectures and bearing with his ego luis paulo lemos horta is not a cool prof
9982,Paulo  Horta,fabulous take anything from this guy a pretty fair marker showing up to class and doing the readings does seem to be a prereq to doing well though
9983,Paulo  Horta,took the trickster and arabian nights courses while back the prof was horrible he does not know how to relate to other people he marked us way too hard and made us read way to much he borrowed money from students and he totally played favourites
9984,Paulo  Horta,my first thought was a page novel you gotta be kidding in year and noone ever asked me to read a book this long but i loved don quixote other books prof rides you hard so you expect a tough marker but actually a softie when you get your marks back
9985,Jamie  Mills,the worst professor i have ever had arrogant and disrespectful to students have a question bother asking she will tell you to just rewatch her video lesson her quiz questions feel like just trying to trick you and make you second guess yourself organization of assignments in blackboard yeah forget that avoid her if possible
9986,Jamie  Mills,awful
9987,Jamie  Mills,disrespectful towards students when you ask her a simple question goes way too fast in lectures and does an awful job preparing you for quizzes do not take her
9988,Jamie  Mills,very rude treats you like a child because she thinks grad students are superior class isnt that hard but take another professor if possible
9989,Jamie  Mills,this class about killed me seriously this was an online class and there was no routine she refused to answer questions and she always tried to confuse students on the quizzes you can listen to the lectures times do all the practice problems correctly then get to the test and be like what the crap is she talking about
9990,Jamie  Mills,this is a hard class i know that i done as well with a different type of instructor dr lectures are clear and easy to understand she gives you tons of practice problems that are similar to the graded quizzes and assignments get overwhelmed take it week by week watch the lectures and do the work proud of my a
9991,Jamie  Mills,you are grad students your not in kindergarten she is full of herself rude and refuses to answer questions when directly asked instead she says put it on the discussion board so your class mates can answer it i pay to have an instructor if i wanted to teach myself i would by a book do the work and ask friends if they understood for free
9992,Jamie  Mills,this class is the biggest waste of my time possible unless you will copy information word for word for her examples you will not do well this is the only place that you can get a hundred on a quiz and score a c on a discussion post
9993,Jamie  Mills,will not provide any assistance when needed she comes across as very arrogant and can frankly quite rude she does not understand that this class is an online environment and dealing with numbers online can be tricky the fact that all of her ratings are negativespeak volumes please be mindful of this when taking ber
9994,Jamie  Mills,she makes one mistake per minute on her videos what a waste of space extremely rude and full of herself plan to learn anything
9995,Jamie  Mills,most of this class is online if you take the inclass version still mostly online work is hard but she is enthusiastic about it and understand that we share her passion i will avoid taking any more classes from her although i worked my butt off and got an a
9996,Jamie  Mills,she is indeed a very pompous lady whose class has absolutely nothing to do with the use of statistics in education if you want to figure the average number of tissues per box and can meet each of her tedious mandates for posting assignments you will pass she is not open to communication and is highly judgemental
9997,Jamie  Mills,has anyone mentioned what a waste of breath she is as an instructor she has no idea what she is doing is arrogant and pompous for no reason and needs to go back and take stats again herself
9998,Jamie  Mills,avoid her classes if at all possible i took her anova class and made an a yet i can tell you nothing about how to do anova try to take the stats classes in the psych dept or with godfrey instead
9999,Jamie  Mills,what a waste of time i could have taken this online class without an instructor made an a but definitely had nothing to do with her teaching thank god i had old stats textbooks to rely on
10000,Jamie  Mills,more focused on if students can correctly post comments in a webbased class than teaching statistics
10001,Jamie  Mills,glad hotwish she could teach
10002,Jamie  Mills,extremely hot
10003,Jamie  Mills,damn fine
10004,Tim  Inman,i really enjoyed my class tim was very helpfull and the guidlines were clear wish i could have him for my next english class
10005,Tim  Inman,he seems really rude and arrogant in class but he is a good professor and i learned a lot the class was interesting even though i did not think i would like it at all i would encourage anyone to take this professor he really wants you to do well but expects you to earn it
10006,Tim  Inman,he seems arrogant and hard but really kind hearted he understands things and is pretty forgiving for being late on assignments he lets you resubmit when you make mistakes and if you go to class actually learn some things he is a pretty good teacher he jams a lot of homework into one time frame but all repetitive
10007,Tim  Inman,i thought he was arrogant
10008,Tim  Inman,people told me their english classes were a waste of time but this class was not like that at all i learned a lot of useful information about different writing assignments the instructor explains how to do an assginment and he answers all questions until you know what he wants i recommend inman because he cares about what you are learning
10009,Tim  Inman,easy class easy a but i actually learned a lot it introduces you to writing resumes and internal memos and such even keeping the book because i find it so helpful it will come in handy not a lot of most easy good prof nice guy but he can go on and on talking about every detail of everything overall good
10010,Tim  Inman,take this class there are quite a few writing assignments but you have a ton of time to do them if you do the work get a good grade inman is helpful when you have questions and he is definately not a hard grader i got an a with minimal effort also this class does teach important stuff for the future i learned quite a bit
10011,Tim  Inman,tim is a great teacher and is very easy going he will work with you in any situation to make sure you do well the only way to fail is by attempting to fail if you breath and listen you should do well
10012,Tim  Inman,he is good professor his assignments are not easy but these are very helpful for your future if you need to take eng300 i recommend him
10013,Tim  Inman,if you need to take this course this is the guy to take if you have decent writing skills you have any problems getting an easy a there is also extra credit so that makes it even more possible i have witnessed the alternative professors for this course and inman is the best choice
10014,Tim  Inman,way to much out of class work make sure your computer works because you will need it to do six papers and little assignments
10015,Tim  Inman,inman is very easygoing and this is a great class assignments are not too difficult and tests are open book i would strongly reccommend him
10016,Tim  Inman,he is confusing
10017,Ryan  Meany,clearly very intelligent but the bar is set far too high for an introlevel class the use of the online practice modules feels like tackedon busy work to fill time papers come with unrealistic expectations and without discussion about due dates that he said we would discuss in the future would not recommend especially for new students
10018,Ryan  Meany,mr meany is mean he is opinionated and quiet sarcastic however he knows his stuff he can be a great teacher if you and him share the same ideas but if you then going to be a nightmare
10019,Ryan  Meany,his course is pretty difficult probably not the greatest teacher ever had he can go off on a tangent that can definitely come off as selfindulgent but if a college student going to get professors like that and probably a good start in preparing for those sorts also pretty funny
10020,Ryan  Meany,i would be lying if i said he was easy but his personality is the besy he hates kids which will become apparent through his sarcasm and comments he is a genius and i personally think he is very attractive as for papers be prepared to cry and know your topic pass him off before you pick it but if you get on his good side he will help
10021,Ryan  Meany,do not have class with this professor he will tell you to follow the writing guide and mark you off for doing it if you have your own opinion on a reading and it is not like his you will be wrong he insults students in front of the other students and acts like he is better than everyone else first words out of his mouth is no one makes an a
10022,Ryan  Meany,do not take no matter how hard you try or how good of a writer you are you stil will get a c he really sucks and is mean for absolutely no reason
10023,Ryan  Meany,he is not the easiest person he basically just want you to follow and learn from his guidelines the class discussions can be interesting if you want to make it he listens to his students if really lazy or sensitive and striving for an a or b i recommend
10024,Ryan  Meany,he is not sensitive to medical issues miss this class even if on your death bed you will loose all class participation a very tough grader he never gives to students highly unlikely so consider a b an a in his class
10025,Ryan  Meany,he is mr ryan for me he is not an easy proffesor but he keeps us working hard and making us give our best when i thought i was getting an a i just got a d and that made me focus more and be more perseverant not an easy proffesor but he is mr ryan
10026,Ryan  Meany,meany is a tough opinionated teacher if you have the same mind set or agree with his answers he will argue with you until you force to give in knows what talking about but is a miserable person he converses with you based on his knowledge therefore often difficult to understand my least favorite teacher ever had
10027,Ryan  Meany,he was very mean to me i worked very hard but he gave me an c
10028,Ryan  Meany,very blunt teacher however he is hilarious at first he comes of as a self centered person but after two weeks you get used to him i recommend taking any class he teaches
10029,Ryan  Meany,interesting professor who will tell you how it is he is a pretty tough grader but the way it should be in order to learn class discussions were interesting and very helpful
10030,Ryan  Meany,he is blunt and tells you straight up class discussions have taught me more about life than anything else he pushes you to your limits and you will benefit from this class
10031,Ryan  Meany,honestly an awesome teacher especially if actually interested in english got good insight and makes class fun and interesting he comments on things like a normal person and not an uptight teacher would rather you write papers in your voice not an easy a you have to be a little into it but i would recommend him
10032,Ryan  Meany,expects a lot of his students and is very helpful and honest with critiques gives compliments when deserved and encourages students who make an effort to improve very fair and sensitive
10033,Ryan  Meany,start of the class was bad he is very into his own ideas and not the ideas of others however as the class went on i learned things and he started to listen to me and others papers are graded hard with little feedback and he is not the most helpful person with essay questions if you want to read some good stuff and learn take this professor
10034,Ryan  Meany,i took professor meany for compostion and rhetoric ii and although i had taken the class before i transferred into the university credit mixup he managed to make it challenging for me in the best way possible he is a great guy and will help you as much as you need but expects your very best work pay attention and you will learn a lot
10035,Ryan  Meany,classes are really boring all you do is discuss the readings the whole class time he is an okay guy but hes not really willing to help you with your essay he just tells you to go to the writing center hes a tough grader but hes an ok guy
10036,Ryan  Meany,meany is the best fyw is difficult but worth it if you work hard you will earn the grade you deserve analysis is very important and he helps you learn to dig deeper in reading and writing to a level you never thought was possible best class if you want to learn but if you are looking for an easy a snooze course this it
10037,Michael  Chaney,chaney was an absolute ray of sunshine his film class is fun and chill i had him for an and every morning he made waking up for that class a little bit easier we only had two projects and spent a lot of time talking about and watching films he loves when people talk in his class and he is very excited about what he does
10038,Michael  Chaney,absolutely loved prof chaney super hilarious and he knows what talking about within the film industry do your work and you will get an a two film individual projects midterm and final so not bad he loves when people participate and talk in the class though not many talked in our class maybe because it was an am
10039,Michael  Chaney,chaney is amazing had him for an on a monday and he made it totally bearable he is hilarious and gives you a lot of creative freedom take him
10040,Michael  Chaney,chaney is super cool took him for intro to screenwriting relatable and understands his students really good with feedback on your scripts sometimes he can get distracted easily and it can be annoying but his distractions make class interesting would totally take him again
10041,Michael  Chaney,probably my favorite professor at scad he knows what he is talking about and is very helpful and is great with his critiques he tells lots of stories sometimes relevant sometimes not i would definitely take his class again
10042,Michael  Chaney,professor chaney was such a delightful professor his projects were considerably flexible and super honest when giving critique despite being an am his class was super enjoyable such a fun guy all around take him
10043,Michael  Chaney,he defiantly plays favorites he will love and defend his film major students and practically brush off other majors however worth it i took him at in the morning and he had so much energy you just have to take his comments with a grain of salt
10044,Michael  Chaney,chaney was awesome he really cared about his students and was very encouraging even of films that other teachers may not have supported so much he was also just a really cool guy and gave great projects
10045,Michael  Chaney,chaney is the best he restrict your ideas on projects and always offers great feedback his class was fun and enjoyable even though it was at he really knows how to engage the class and get everyone talking if you can get in definitely take him
10046,Michael  Chaney,great guy loves film which is so important allows creativity and changes deadlines to ensure good product
10047,Michael  Chaney,great
10048,Michael  Chaney,chaney kicks ass he is totally into his students and their films and will bend over backwards to make sure you get what you need to make your film happen if lucky enough to get into his class cherish it
10049,Michael  Chaney,the best senior project prof and the hardest to get he has tons of knowledge
10050,Michael  Chaney,brilliant
10051,Michael  Chaney,as previously mention knows his stuff admits when he is stumped an all around cool guy care greatly for his well being a must take
10052,Michael  Chaney,i have never met someone with so much knowledge in film production who me a real cool guy
10053,Jeffrey  Gutliph,awesome
10054,Jeffrey  Gutliph,took an online class pretty easy sincecollege algebra is mostly same as high school algebra used videos on connectmath as review and made easy a lot of homework but discussions are easy it was just roll call or saying something like i understand
10055,Jeffrey  Gutliph,this class is not easy so much work in connectmath insane but professor gutliph is great he knows you have lots of work to do and he tries to help you and make it easier on you as much as he can for example his discussions are easy and he gives a great review for your midterm and final exam definitely recommend
10056,Jeffrey  Gutliph,no matter what professor you take online a selfteaching class connectmath have any mercy on students load work is insane we had about videos to watch about questions homework and hour quiz each week not a multiple choice professor gutliph gave us a great midterm review will take him again
10057,Jeffrey  Gutliph,i would highly recommend mr gutliph there is a lot of work in connect math and it can be very time consuming so be prepared to do the homework if i have the opportunity to attend one of his classes in the future i will he is a great professor and actually cares that you pass his class
10058,Jeffrey  Gutliph,i took this class online in the fall it is basically selfteaching and i fell behind everything is on a ebook homework quizzes ect he teach anything you teach yourself lotts of hw find yourself behind i failed the class
10059,Jeffrey  Gutliph,if youre thinking of taking gutliph do it for an online class he is extremely helpful and interacts with his students he grades fairly overload with too much homework and prepares for tests he is super helpful and has good taste in music as well which makes him all the more awesome take him you will not regret it one bit
10060,Jeffrey  Gutliph,math or discrete math is not an easy class and it is much harder online dr gutliph was the first to put this class online and i struggled until the end i suppose the course will get refined and better but it is so not an easy a my class found plenty of online videos i am sure he will share with the next classes overall he is a fair grader
10061,Jeffrey  Gutliph,everything is on webassign homeworkquizzes except for the midtermfinal so make sure to get it the ebook comes with webassign so you really need the actual book i fell a little behind in his class but caught up and passed with an a good luck really laid back and a great teacher you regret taking him d
10062,Jeffrey  Gutliph,mr g is one of a kind he is very straight forward a clear communicator and very responsive and helpful his videos are awesome hilarious has great taste in music and is interested in the success of each of his students highly recommended so much so took a second class and will take another with him as well
10063,Jeffrey  Gutliph,had mr g for several online math classes the best when it comes to online math courses at gpc his video lectures are clear and very fashionable if you have a question he responds to email promptly teacher
10064,Jeffrey  Gutliph,i took this class online and passed with a b you do have to put in the work but the professor is the best just make sure you keep up with your weekly assignments and quizzes he provides study guides for both midterm and final you need only to buy the code for the book
10065,Jeffrey  Gutliph,i need this class how much is the midterm and final worth does his study guides prepare for exams this will be my second attempt is he really helpful is there book homework or only webassign work does he allow use of electronic help mathway and other calculators
10066,Jeffrey  Gutliph,awesome take him of homework but he is willing to help all the time
10067,Jeffrey  Gutliph,mr gutliph is a great professor that wants all of his students to succeed this is not an easy class by any means but doable there are two homework assignments a quiz every week but he gives you the entire semester to turn them in do them weekly fall behind he gives u a midterm final study guide with every question need
10068,Jeffrey  Gutliph,let me start by saying this is not an easy class you will have tons of homework to do each week that being said i think almost all algebra classes have the same work mr g is a good guy and wants people to pass if you do the homework and study his review you will be fine may not get an a but you will pass i would recommend
10069,Jeffrey  Gutliph,great professor math my subject but i did great in his class took him in the summer so i had to cram a lot into about weeks he provides a lot of resources for help and responds fast great math professor
10070,Jeffrey  Gutliph,the best math teacher hands down i took him for math and math and always had the mindset that i was going to fail cause so bad with math but he made everything different very helpful you would need to make a lot of time for his class but worth taking take him you regret it
10071,Jeffrey  Gutliph,very nice professor answers emails promptly however doesnt have chat hours which is really hard to deal with especially for a math course otherwise everything is with webassign not so bad i would recommend him
10072,Jeffrey  Gutliph,great teacher must be dedicated to getting assignments in on time he gives fair chances and is always willing to help definitely take his class

10094,Bill  O\'Neill,when he lectured it was clear during his critiques you were ripped apart if you did something slightly off or what you thought at the time was funny he plays favorites though if anybody ever played favorites it was him and you know he always only wanted to give help only to the skinny white chicks
10095,Bill  O\'Neill,bill is one of the coolest teachers ever he helped me find freelance work while i was still going to school used many of the things he taught me on my last game title advent rising and techniques currently using on king kong here at weta digi

10108,Paul  Haynie,class was very easy tests straightforward and right off the study guide slightly boring at times but his demonstration of what a curtsey is made my semester
10109,Paul  Haynie,class is pretty much exactly the same every day however he talks about the material like its a campfire story very knowledgeable and kind his tests are incredibly straight forward highly recommend

10111,Paul  Haynie,a true historian in every sense of the word he made the history come to life power point slides and stories of a personal nature that glued me to my seat considered changing my major from bible to history great professor
10112,Paul  Haynie,i had from war and though it was occasionally boring it was still a good class if you fill out the study guides then you will ace the tests and the test is easy as long as you know the info he has fascinating stories to tell that add interest to the class he taught a class on revelation at my church and i loved it
10113,Paul  Haynie,classes are boring but all the powrpoint presentations done in class are also available online his tests are directly off of the study guides wordforword and there are no assignments outside of class extra credit is easy to recieve as wll
10114,Paul  Haynie,i have dr haynie for both american history and western civ right now i absolutely love his class somedays boring but other days way interesting i would recommend him to anyone he puts all the powerpoints online and you print off the study guide word for word questions on study guide as the test easy love it
10115,Paul  Haynie,he never gave us study guides and there is no textbook the tests are not really on what he teaches he tells us silly random stories that have no historical significance still fun facts but knowing them get you a good grade really funny and nice and if you miss a class he lets you skip on the exam
10116,Paul  Haynie,dr haynie is the best teacher i have ever had a big part of why i became a teacher he really brought the subjects to life and i strive to do that for my students
10117,Paul  Haynie,very boring but what history class the study guide gave you the answers for the test you just have to memorize it not bad just sort of mediocre
10118,Paul  Haynie,ugh
10119,Paul  Haynie,haynie is easier than most of my high school teachers a nice man but not in any way challenging or worthy of collegiate teaching
10120,Paul  Haynie,haynie is awesome he can get boring in class if you are not interested in what he is talking about he is very focused on his teaching everyone else saying that his tests are his study guides they are absolutly right getting an a in his class is easy if you show up
10121,Paul  Haynie,dr haynie is fantastic one of the few teachers that is truly passionate about what he teaches very interesting willing to help you with whatever he can

10128,Kayla  Haynie,one of the best teachers at harding passionate about teaching and easily keeps your attention truly cares about her students and their ability to do well not only in her class but life in general
10129,Kayla  Haynie,wonderful woman very funny highly recommend for world lit reading is minimal and test expectations are clear

10131,Kayla  Haynie,i loved this class she is my favorite teacher ever i am taking her next semester as well she is always open for help and gives us more time if we need it she is a little silly but that is what keeps us laughing it is my favorite class to go to
10132,Kayla  Haynie,her class is a little bit of a challenge lots of memorization but she is the coolest teacher she makes class enjoyable and humorous most of the time she even plays movies of some of the stories

10137,Kayla  Haynie,this lady is amazing the most accommodating professor ever sometimes to the point of being a little too easy on her students however at the same time she provokes students to participate in very intellectual thought and conversation i highly recommend her
10138,Kayla  Haynie,class is amazing we have some deep discussions sometimes and it is interesting we also missed alot of classes and got out early often reading material is very interesting too this was an awesome class recommended
10139,Kayla  Haynie,mrs haynie is probably one of my favorite professors in life she is still to this day a good friend and a mentor to me i love her and her classes were awesome
10140,Kayla  Haynie,mrs haynie is one of my favorite teachers ever she really makes the subject interesting she cares about her students and very helpful with students who need extra help and teaching more proficient students new skills
10141,Kayla  Haynie,she is one of if not best teachers i have ever is so amazing and awesome she gets her points across gwell keeps you interested and if you struggling she will help you go over assignments with you so you get a bad grade on it if you do every thing she tells you in class with at least effort you should no lower than a b
10142,Kayla  Haynie,oh my i only have good things to say about her class i was dreading comp ii but she made is soo enjoyable take her i have always hated writing and all that kind of stuff but she made is relatively fun for me and i got a good grade
10143,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,i took her at nyu the class was incredibly interesting the hw assignments were thorough but really helped you understand the material she knows what talking about and really wants the students to learn and will explain things until everyone gets it she allowed us to determine exam and essay formats and we made up our own final questions
10144,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,so passionate about the course and it really shows which definitely helped me stop being bitter about having to take this to graduate the paper really that hard and the weekly quizzes make it easy to know where you stand in the course i highly recommend her
10145,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,really cool teacher she is very passionate about the subject and her class is somewhat enjoyable her grading is difficult but if you put time into it she will give you a good grade
10146,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,lots of reading but nice because there are weekly quizzes instead of tests you can tell she is passionate about the subject a cool gal
10147,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,tests are opening book and gives out questions ahead of time if you prepare do great very understanding of life out of class
10148,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,page paper from hell she is very biased and if she hates you give you a bad great dont waste your time in this class
10149,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,took this course expecting it to be about women and religion in ancient the title suggests and yet somehow have found myself in an archeology course unless into that sort of thing rather be watching paint dry a disgustingly easy a flake.this was for a gender studies i learned about ancient pots
10150,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,she is a great she a great teacher her class is not hard at all very funny and extremely caring the quizes are every friday to review for the week and she drops the lowest grade you play jeopardy for extra credit she puts underlying theory to practice lol take her class
10151,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,great teacher.she is very respectful toward faith when compared with other theology teachers two papers one alone and one with group both were easy very funny participate in class and you will get tons of extra credit not to much reading compared to other theology classes lots of quizes read text book for quizes be fine
10152,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,hebrew bible taking care of my ger and she is making it great other reviews are old so listen to me this lady is a real sweetheart slightly intimidating at first but that vanishes quizzes on fridays are straightforward two short simple papers as well has a sense of humor and is a little cutie take her again
10153,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,this class is unbelievable boring the quizzes are hard and she no longer does tests quiz consists of questions with options for answers she expects you to know details about everything you read so unless you are a theo major stay clear oh and she grades essays based on how much she likes you for most of the class that means they failed
10154,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,she is good i actually like her she is not that bad and tells you what exactly is on test
10155,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,i know what talking about she has you read and expects you to know what you read def boring material but she will love you if you raise your hand even once per class there are some dates to know but she will tell you what to know super helpful and understanding id take her again
10156,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,she is a very sweet lady we had quizzes every friday which she curves participation helps because the class itself is very boring she is not strict with dates there were tests a midterm and final we played jeopardy to prepare and most people got the reading is too much pages if not a theology major
10157,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,second level theology she made it hell impossible memorization of every king and figure in the bible lots of timelines need to know exact dates unless u r a theo major take this class
10158,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,awful professor who was biased against the guys in the class made of the guys redo their papers even though in my best opinion we did well i do not recommend her ever
10159,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,no comments
10160,Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith,boring class ease up on the grading too i put b.c and got points off cause it was b.c
10161,Roger  Magyar,this guy is tough first of all everything he says seems to be about hungary prof magyar nobody cares teach the course and theology has no place in philosophy they are two different animals dont rec to anyone avoid if
10162,Roger  Magyar,no comments
10163,Roger  Magyar,easy but then graded really hard on the papers to achieve bell curve
10164,Roger  Magyar,ugh just tell me what you are thinking
10165,Roger  Magyar,hey pal i have a hint for ya bring theology into the mix when you are teaching philosophy also the end of the class should be reserved for question time not personal crisis time i recommend this teacher to anyone
10166,Roger  Magyar,literally whole class sat there and had no idea what he was talking about ask a question get a ridiculous wordy answer my advice to you prof magyar start using concret examples for your moral philosophy
10167,Theodore  Venema,teddy is my hero best prof ever had he always kept my attention with his antics about mrs mcgillicutty his little songs and his famous accents unfortunately western did not recognized his sheer brilliance in the classroom and they have not renewed his contract what a loss to our department we will all miss you very much teddy

10194,Bryan  Fair,a brilliant constitutional scholar that is not afraid to tackle the sensitive constitutional issues that confront our nation he is very clear about is stance on the issues the court but he does not attempt to get you to adopt his views he teaches the class in a fair objective and balanced manner and he will go out of his way to help students
10195,Bryan  Fair,he rambles endlessly and gives lectures from memory he well prepared for every class although he obviously knowns what he is talking about it comes across disjointed and is impossible to take notes from just drill the book and teach your self supplements save lives
10196,Bryan  Fair,professor fair is the best teacher that ever had he makes it clear from day that he is available to help his students if you take the time to really listen to him you will learn a lot his lectures are well crafted the average listener will learn constitutional law but the attentive student will learn so much more he is genius
10197,Bryan  Fair,no comments
10198,Bryan  Fair,great professor he is always on the level with his students and will do almost anything to help them out
10199,Bryan  Fair,fair is the best professor at this law school he also truly is interested in students a rarity at this place see singer norman and bill
10200,Bryan  Fair,no comments
10201,Bryan  Fair,first con law is a terrible subject that being said he the greatest prof either his teaching style leaves a lot to be desired but a real nice guy he lets you know what he expects and fair just like his name says
10202,Bryan  Fair,great guy
10203,Bryan  Fair,fair is one of the professors truly interested in the students at the law school i say that to slight other professors i enjoyed his class and knowing him as a person i do however refuse to rate his hotness
10204,Bryan  Fair,no comments
10205,Bryan  Fair,no comments
10206,Bryan  Fair,professor fair is one of the best at the law school if you want to learn the law you have got to meet this guy
10207,Eric  Rawdon,funny guy love the adidas great singing voice nicely dressed easy to understand easy to ask questions very knowledgeable makes class interesting
10208,Eric  Rawdon,dr rawdon is easily one of the best profs at duquesne he takes a class that could be very monotonous and makes it fun he moves very quickly but always willing to slow down and help if you need it his combination of humor and serious teaching makes the class fly by and before you know it you understand calc pretty amazing
10209,Eric  Rawdon,he is a funny guy but thats not what the class should be about he doesnt teach anything at all he just copies problems onto the board straight from the book and then tells a story about his son he isnt very good at answering questions either
10210,Eric  Rawdon,hysterical also a very good teacher he moves at a rather fast pace you need to do the homework in order to keep up his tests have any suprises on them always give you the test from the previous year by far the most entertaining math class ever had
10211,Eric  Rawdon,if you have taken calc in highschool the class can still be hard but not unbearable do the homework and take your time on the quizes they can be tricky his teaching methods are good though he gives you the fishing pole instead of the fish
10212,Eric  Rawdon,he makes class interesting although very challenging i liked him so much in calc one i took him in calc two
10213,Eric  Rawdon,great professor he is extremely intelligent personable and very hot he keeps class interesting by telling funny stories
10214,Eric  Rawdon,great teach but hard class he kept the class interesting however he did not explain maple and other programs used in the class making the class harder than it had to be
10215,Eric  Rawdon,one of the best math professors not only is he really intelligent but also really funny face it integration is not most definition of a good time but i absolutely loved the class
10216,Eric  Rawdon,very hard class not easy expects you to know things that were never taught stay away
10217,Eric  Rawdon,you will never encounter another math prof with a better personality he keeps you from drifting off with his random stories about goulash etc
10218,Eric  Rawdon,awesome teacher very good at breaking the monotony especially since he teaches math yet you still learn a ton only down side is very long homework assignments which checked in depth tests too bad overall one of finest
10219,Eric  Rawdon,had for calc and topics in math very very good would definitely recommend the coolest teacher you will ever have both in class and out without a doubt take him
10220,Eric  Rawdon,really fun and interesting
10221,Eric  Rawdon,only one of the coolest professors you could ever ask for
10222,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,my favorite professor at eku in years hard grader but really rewards improvement writing assignments are short and easy he tells really great stories take the class for the stories alone
10223,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,after i read these reviews i want to like this class but one smile at me the first day and he got me yeah he knows a campus rock star but it only adds to his charm the man just loves his job never in a bad mood passionate and brilliant every class is a show and learn alot sit in front for the best view
10224,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,class was fun but i go i read or do anything i was going to withdraw midterm but he told me if i committed hard to class he would help me with the work and maybe i could pass on a d worked my butt off and got a b at the end really really good guy because he cares about students and helps so much best professor ever
10225,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,dr rahimzadeh is intimidating at first and yes arrogant but he has every right to be he has such a strong grasp of early english literature and his lectures immediately pull you in brilliant and passionate and very funny after a few weeks you realize so sweet too and his clothes are cuter than anybody in class a plus
10226,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,totally adorable this weird combination of super shy and super aggressive at the same time everything you want from a professor crazy smart and always entertaining listen to lectures carefully because every sentence he says is hilarious every single one and like he says do the reading come to class take notes go home with the a
10227,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,if you take this professor during your time at eku you will never forgive yourself if every professor were like him id never want to graduate he is absolutely incredible he cares about the students he is insanely smart and outgoing and wants to see you succeed please if you get the chance take class with him you regret it
10228,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,if you have the chance to take him do it he will make you work for your grade but if you put in the effort he is willing to give you as much help as you need he seriously is amazing
10229,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,dr rahimzadeh is an amazing professor in his class you feel respected and you want to be there he is so funny and smart very approachable and is so willing to help and encourage you there is a group presentation but most of your grade on that is for preparation so just do your work and be fine attendance is mandatory
10230,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,dr rahimzadeh is brilliant and he knows it which can be very annoying been everywhere read everything and he thinks right about everything but also the nicest most supportive funniest professor had at eastern and yes nice to look at if you take his class you are missing out on a key eku experience
10231,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,dr rahimzadeh is by far my favorite professor he is so helpful and tries to connect with each student i have been to his office multiple times and he always encourages me and tells me what to do to get better with my work he also keeps his lectures interesting and makes the entire class laugh constantly i would recommend taking him
10232,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,a silver fox with a side of awesome sauce he has a gazillion lines of shakespeare memorized so every class starts with a performance sometimes with props and costumes really cool and really fun and learn tons just let him catch you staring at his eyes or his hair or his everything blush and it will be awkward
10233,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,this was probably one of the most amazing classes i have ever experienced in college dr rahimzadeh managed to make the most boring horrible ancient stories some of the most interesting things to learn about if you read the text and come to class there is no reason you get an a seriously brilliant and he will change your life
10234,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,there is a lot of work to do in the class but it made me feel like i had earned my a i like everything we had read but his lectures about the texts were so much fun and his knowledge blew me away he explains the importance of every text and is just overall a great teacher highly recommend
10235,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,i want to take john milton but had to have an upper level now obsessed with him and the renaissance era this was most intense experience had at eastern and pretty much every one of dr lectures blew our minds brilliant and passionate and he is beautiful to look at and listen to take anything he teaches
10236,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,he is a great professor he loves to sit down and meet with you one on one and is willing to help at any time
10237,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,he tells you exactly how to get an a you have to work for it but if willing right there he is always willing to talk to you make accommodations and really goes out of his way to help a student who asks for it he says any version of the text book is fine but make sure you get the old version
10238,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,dr rahimzadeh is such a great professor lectures are always interesting but do not miss them because on the test and he is hilarious i think anyone could make early lit fun but he does two pg papers and one pg paper and a little picky but helpful if you take good notes and read the stories do fine
10239,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,amazing professor definitely made my shakespeare course amazing he was very clear in lectures and what he expected for exams he try to trip you up and has a genuine desire for you to succeed tests are not cumulative also a funny and engaging speaker you will hear lots of great stories definitely recommend
10240,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,brilliant man absolutely one of the best eku has to offer take a class with him if you can you regret it
10241,Kevin  Rahimzadeh,dr rahimzadeh is an awesome professor funny crystal clear with the material you will leave knowing that you waste your time or money do the homework and show up for class also acting projects are big in this class very fun note if you want to act take his class
10242,Francis  Chan,no comments
10243,Francis  Chan,excellent professor innovative teacher
10244,Francis  Chan,very good teaching style funny unique
10245,Monica  Reimer,monica is by far the worst employee at uvic she is rude unclear and makes these labs as hard as she possibly can i get why to weed out the weak students who be furthering their degree in chemistry but she makes it miserable to want to pursue even if a student is capable enough i received an a in and am taking
10246,Monica  Reimer,the lab portion of chem is ran by monica pray that you do not have her as your ta she is unkind and very very intimidating you can not mess up or make a mistake if she is anywhere near by chem labs are marked very unfairly because not all the mark the same chem labs are extremely time consuming and misleading go to help hours
10247,Monica  Reimer,the rumors are true she is a very difficult woman but if you need chem for your degree you avoid her she is the senior lab instruction for yr labs and the for though you have to teach yourself everything its online be prepared get your work in on time and hope for the best its not likely have any grace
10248,Monica  Reimer,monica in person outside of class she can be nice in class another story she is very rude unreasonable and she gives you the run around like she be bothered if you have to take chem i suggest you take it at camosun and transfer the credits i have had to go over her head many times for my lab to be graded again for a proper mark
10249,Monica  Reimer,i agree that there are too many formal lab papers give this is just the laboratory component of one five courses that any student is dealing with
10250,Monica  Reimer,give you enough time to do the writeup i had only two days and i had to contend with a physics writeup as well the labs take three hours and the lab itself three hours which is a little bit long
10251,Monica  Reimer,i would recommend considering applying to ubc instead of uvic their courses are much more balanced than uvic which is more technical like a trades program
10252,Monica  Reimer,the laboratory part of this course takes too much time in general at other schools there are less full write ups which allows students to focus more on the lecture course
10253,Monica  Reimer,she marks hard but consistent when i asked for feedback on a grade i found harsh she willingly set up a meeting and explain where i lost points and how i could improve my lab marks significantly increased following this meeting i found her very helpful if questions were well thought out and relevant
10254,Monica  Reimer,i spend to much time doing the lab whcih is not corelated to the course and teaches you nothing lots and lots of formal writeups at this school
10255,Monica  Reimer,too many formal papers not a good instituion if you quailfy to attend ubc make sure you go there
10256,Monica  Reimer,not a good program at all too much busy work
10257,Monica  Reimer,i believe that the chem labs at uvic are designed too much as busy work and do not encourage the use of brain the labs are laborious but nothing is learned
10258,Monica  Reimer,my first ever ta at university she really goes hard on you especially on safety but because this is your first chemistry lab and if you get it down now get hurt later on and she does not want that at all nice sometimes sometimes not really hit or miss switch if you can future labs will be better if you continue chem
10259,Monica  Reimer,because of her behaviors i changed the major she is very tough grader proferrsor during my first year in the university i faced lots of probelms and these probelms because of her i emailed her for asking the questions about lab she told me that i need to study by myself and she was not a high school teacher i was so dejected
10260,Monica  Reimer,ever expect monica to cut you any slack because its guaranteed she wont
10261,Monica  Reimer,very rude is not empathetic at all does she have human emotions no one knows
10262,Monica  Reimer,really terrifying make sure you study for your lab quizzes and be prepared for her to be really harsh
10263,Monica  Reimer,labs correlate with the lecture material
10264,Monica  Reimer,sets you up to fail
10265,William  Masten,he is awful his instructions are confusing he gives very long exam reviews and then not of it is on the actual exam you get a minute to answer each question on exams and they are the majority of your grade
10266,William  Masten,professor masten had me concerned at the beginning of the semester however i followed grading guidelines for discussion boards which are easy and essays and did well the tests are a little more difficult because they are closed and given a very limited time
10267,William  Masten,not a very good professor but not the worst like going to mcdonalds when you want chickfila
10268,William  Masten,great professor by far the best one i have had for an online class about essays throughout the class but makes it clear of what he expects gives feedback even if it is just to say it was a good essay which i believe means a lot
10269,William  Masten,inspirational caring
10270,William  Masten,i would take him again now that i understand his grading and standards they made clear in the syllabus so it took a while only two quizzes but they are definitely challenging essays are hard to figure out at first but there are and a discussion every week overall not a bad class just depends on your preference
10271,William  Masten,a good professor his lectures to long or boring he does group and solo activities so you just sitting there listening to him talk there a lot of reading from the textbook and he is a nice person i would recommend his class because not boring he rude and the material is interesting
10272,William  Masten,organized lectures great prof cares about students best in commerce complain takes time with students
10273,William  Masten,best prof in this univ
10274,William  Masten,i am in psy now spring and he has only five essays in weeks plus short opinion questions it is almost impossible not to get full credit he does was want references in apa style and does not permit direct quotations the tests are bit hard
10275,William  Masten,this professor gave wayy too many assignments we had several repetitious assignments within the first week i do not like the way he organizes his work on blackboard he is just a confusing professor overall i would not recommend taking him
10276,William  Masten,professor masten was excellent this semester he will work with you and has the grades posted quickly
10277,William  Masten,william masten is not a professor ever recommend lectures are very scattered the only benefit is that all the information you need to pass is in the power points and book expect to gain much from him personally
10278,William  Masten,masten while sure a great harilous person outside of class definately not that way in class he is very unclear of this subject and reads straight from his pearson powerpoints i will not take his class again because i learned absolutely nothing
10279,William  Masten,summer on line class syllabus was long and confusing his response to email ques were even more confusing tests were impossible to prepare for and cover material that went with assignments a lot of papers up to per week but easy class not paced well online set up disorganized he turn in grades on time to register
10280,William  Masten,worse professor i ever had he is not willing to help students out and is random in class when he attempted to teach he would use youtube videos of others teaching
10281,William  Masten,this online course is super easy but you have to do your reading to pass any and all quizzes there are quizzes no exams and no paper just read turn your work in on time and get your a
10282,William  Masten,dr online classes are always easy however he grade discussions in a timely manner sometimes it can be or weeks before you find out your grade and by that time you have completed several more discussion posts exams are easy and are graded automatically
10283,William  Masten,dr masten knows a lot and teaches a great course some students he should throw out on their ear but he puts up with them for some reason
10284,William  Masten,he knows psychology but he is very scattered and unhelpful i dont know what happened between the good reviews and now but he does not like us asking questions he gets off topic all the time most of us bought the book from the bookstore and they have the edition he is still on the and doesnt care that the chapters are very different
10285,Adele  Mueller,the assignments were very easy but assigned very randomly almost no notice for our final essay just a few days before it was due it on the syllabus a nice person but very forgetful and vague student discussion made up of class content would not take again
10286,Adele  Mueller,nice lady not a great prof she has a lot of interest in the subject but she really know what she is doing forgets everything including to show up for class tries really hard to make other people agree with her opinions
10287,Adele  Mueller,adele is the most amazing professor i have ever had all these ratings stating a horrible professor are probably from lazy students who refuse to think out of the box she is a sociology prof and expects you think sociologically.she has trouble convey her message but take the time to talk to her one on one and all become clear
10288,Adele  Mueller,a brilliant professor make sure to show up to class and get yourself recognized the more active you are in your own education the more she is willing to help you along if you put effort into your papers you will be rewarded for it highly recommended
10289,Adele  Mueller,she is brilliant and fantastic sh has a hard time conveying her intelligence but she is simply marvelous
10290,Adele  Mueller,absolutely the worst professor ever had never knew what was expected of us in the class because she know what was going on herself spent whole semesters begging her to tell us what the assignments were so have a mark for the term then when she did assign something forget she assigned it most disorganized person ever
10291,Adele  Mueller,adele is a really great prof who really cares about what she is teaching and her students.you really have to show up to class and do all the course material but the class itself is quite easy
10292,Adele  Mueller,as long as you do the readings simple do the work and you can pass no prob
10293,Adele  Mueller,i love this woman yep scatteredbrain but oh well amazing and really cares about the subject get to know her outside of the classroom and you regret it she is one of my fave profs and be taking more courses with her next semester
10294,Adele  Mueller,no comments
10295,Adele  Mueller,adele rocks not surprising that most intro students like her she use powerpoint and makes you think out of the box she can be scatterbrained but she knows what talking about and she loves what she does if you put effort in you will be rewarded
10296,Adele  Mueller,i do not recommend this professor to any students wishing interested in sociology turned me off completly to the subject too many classes were spent watching pointless videos writing endless reading notes that were worth very little if attendance taken i prob never would have gone to class nice person though not so great prof
10297,Adele  Mueller,if you are a shy person do not take the class sociology of gender is a class where she wants you to participate basically she just picks people randomly and gets them to give out answers and opinions interesting class but not for shy students
10298,Adele  Mueller,horrible prof never knows what she will do each day very unorganized never hasmarks back until months later learned nothing from her
10299,Adele  Mueller,horrible prof never knows what she will do each day very unorganized never hasmarks back until months later learned nothing from her
10300,Adele  Mueller,mueller is a very oblivious professor she sometimes just goes on random rants that make no sense what so ever and have relation to the topic at hand during the start of the year i was looking forward to sociology but now this field is ruined for me because of the experience in her class
10301,Adele  Mueller,i love adele she is great i have had her for both research methods and senior seminar i was iffy at first she does tend to be back and forth about due dates and requirements but she is an easy marker always willing to sit down and have a chat very caring individual
10302,Adele  Mueller,i love adele i have had alot of boring profs that just stand in front and say exactly what was in the book like i cant read she talks about stuff that isnt on the test there arent any tests if you did the readings you can get an a on every single paper i have credits with her all shes very easy to talk to also
10303,Adele  Mueller,adele is not clear at all all over the place you have no idea whether you will get an a or a d on a paper that is if she doesnt loose it first not recommended classes useless talking about the same points over and over again
10304,Adele  Mueller,okay im not going to be mean ill be fair she is scatterbrained but all sociology profs are hense the discipline must have an effect on the mind she is a little crazy but a great woman she shouldnt be condemned for personality i did not even know what was going on in her class but if i talked to her one on one she was fine
10305,Mary  Talbert,she was soo great makes sure you understand works with you until you get it
10306,Mary  Talbert,mrs talbert is awesome she makes sure you understand the each math concept before moving on takes time with each student to help them.i feel well prepared for intermediate algebra
10307,Mary  Talbert,mrs talbert and mrs french teach math at northeast and i really recommend you take their class they are extremely helpful work is easy they are always friendly they offer online classes which are so awesome and most of all they truly care how you do in the tests had made and they rock math is so easy now
10308,Mary  Talbert,i feel well prepared for intermediate she is very helpful and takes the time to explain things if you get it the first time she is very patient i was math challanged before this class and now i feel like i have a good base to move on
10309,Mary  Talbert,basic algebra very energetic instructor answers questions thoroughly makes math fun and enjoyable i highly recomend her
10310,Mary  Talbert,not necessarily a easy class but well worth your effort and time this instructor is awesome she builds your knowledge up from ground zero to algebra she is very thorough takes the extra time to work with students not something you see every
10311,Mary  Talbert,very good teacher for beginning algebra very helpful and encourageing i was well prepared for intermediate level
10312,Mary  Talbert,awesome teacher i recomend her to anyone she is great
10313,Mary  Talbert,awesome teacher and she goes out of her way to help you out if you have a problem
10314,Mary  Phillips,amazing teacher ms phillips has great lectures miss them she gives practice tests do them the semester project was time consuming but you learn a lot labs are fun laid back and fairly easy lab reports follow rubric and you do fine one of the best teachers at tcc five stars
10315,Mary  Phillips,i loved prof p her assignments were not difficult film summary labs were fun tests are open book for the most part if you run into any life issues as she calls them email her she really cares about you definitely best instructor had online responds to emails did you know you feed your cat milk would take again if i could
10316,Mary  Phillips,prof phillips is a great teacher definitely one of my favorites at tcc she really cares i learned a lot but i had to work hard tests are fair usually there is a practice test start your semester project early i loved this class and wish she taught other classes
10317,Mary  Phillips,my favorite class so far at tcc very fair and understanding ask for an extension if you need one professor phillips loves biology you will too study take notes do your extra credit
10318,Mary  Phillips,professor phillips loves her job and has so much to teach sit close listen be on time its a lot of work but also a lot to learn she is such a caring teacher and wants you to pass you find many professors like her so miss this
10319,Mary  Phillips,great teacher if you are a hard worker you will pass
10320,Mary  Phillips,mrs phillips is a very caring teacher she will work with your schedule just ask she loves biology and expects a lot but i appreciate that as a major keep up take good notes she is very fair i loved the class and mrs phillips
10321,Mary  Phillips,mary wells phillips bio for majors she is a great professor she can be a bit confusing but she cares shes super sweet and cares for her students education you will have to do a semester project that deals with research or volunteering work and a presentation for all of it you can either choose a research project or to volunteer
10322,Mary  Phillips,prof class was pretty enjoyable to take i had been dreading taking bio but she has made it an easy experience i was in a blended class that met once a week for lab so for our class she was a little easier with the deadlines but really understanding if not interested in doing a semester project take the class
10323,Mary  Phillips,professor phillips does everything she can to make learning fun and easy to understand she helps you be the best you can be in her class and she is full of amazing stories and information about biology
10324,Mary  Phillips,i enjoyed the class a lot the first couple of labs were a little confusing but after that the remaining labs were great professor phillips was always well organized and always wanted her students to succeed even though i have not been big into science or biology this class taught me a lot very nice and helpful when life happens
10325,Mary  Phillips,prof phillips was an amazing teacher if you put fourth an effort you will pass very responsive on emails very good lectures a wonderful professor and person
10326,Mary  Phillips,great instructor and person very organized gives great feedback practice exams yeah makes you ask questions wish she taught other courses absolutely recommend ms phillips loved her and her class
10327,Mary  Phillips,prof phillips was one of my favorite professors had so far i took her blended biology class so i only saw her for a lab once a week the weekly workload was very clearly lined out and i knew what was due and when she was pretty lenient on due dates if you asked her and was always willing to help i would highly recommend
10328,Mary  Phillips,prof phillips was awesome she is an extremely kind woman who will help you out if you ask also very flexible with due dates i learned a lot but there were times when i was just confused on what to tests and assignments too bad there is one big semester project that took up a lot of time take prof phillips loved her
10329,Mary  Phillips,theres not really much to say about her besides she is an amazing teacher she loves what she does and when she starts to get in to it you can see her eyes light up she is incredibly sweet and will help you if you fall behind tests and quizzes are open book and the semester project is big but worth it in the end
10330,Mary  Phillips,professor phillips is a very good professor she really cares about her students and wants to seeyou succeed her lectures can be confusing sometimes because she goes off on tangents she responds to emails in a timely manner and is always willing to help out after class if you have questions just remember to go to class or you will get lost
10331,Mary  Phillips,mrs phillips was not the best at getting back to you on time via email but if you stayed after class to talk she is more than willing to hear you out and fix any problems your having
10332,Mary  Phillips,i really loved professor phillips i genuinely enjoyed attending her class each week there were sometimes when the assignments were a bit confusing but she was extremely lenient with due dates when she knew that we were confused she always emailed back very fast and was always very willing to meet up whenever needed she is also super nice
10333,Mary  Phillips,professor phillips is terrific she loves biology and cares about her students she is knowledgeable and will try to explain things so that you can understand everything is posted on bb so if you miss a lecture you get too lost i enjoyed the labs and videos i highly recommend
10334,Mike  Dinneen,best prof ive ever had
10335,Mike  Dinneen,hard course but an excellent professor who clearly knows what he is doing it is a challenging course but if you put in the work then you will do fine
10336,Mike  Dinneen,i loved this class mr dinneen knows his stuff and presents it in a way that actually makes it interesting his tests are not easy but he gives several opportunities for extra credit towards the end of the semester i really feel like i learned and retained a lot of information in this class show up take good notes and be fine
10337,Mike  Dinneen,i took his week online course and for anyone who is considering taking it be ready to read answer questions in clear detail and sit down and really work on the course for at least hours at a time if you really put in the effort easily pass plus a great professor and pretty funny too
10338,Mike  Dinneen,i took this class online there is a lot of reading from the textbook and powerpoint lectures tests are in the form of essays and you have to know your stuff to get a good grade he gives detailed feedback which is helpful and offers weekly extra credit this class is not an easy a but he is a good professor and i learned a ton
10339,Mike  Dinneen,for the first test i was furious i studied hard read all assignments got barely c i found what he is looking for i got a pay attention what he said this will be in test or on the test i want you to draw the diagram he said those when students having hot debate i did all the extra credits questions be prepared be creative
10340,Mike  Dinneen,i wondered why he have a perfect score now that i see the rating criteria not an easy a and i think want to be the work is fair college he does a great job explaining things he answers every question and he grades fair i wish i had him for every course
10341,Mike  Dinneen,mike is very passionate about teaching government he is tough but if you attend every class and keep up with the readings you will pass his class
10342,Mike  Dinneen,he is awesome at first i sure but it got better when he assigns a reading read it he will quiz you lectures are long he sometimes goes over time but only by a few minutes he is funny cracks silly jokes study for his exams they are not easy they are questions and written you must work for grade would absolutely take him again
10343,Mike  Dinneen,mr dineen is a excellent teacher very professional.his class used alots of powerpoint which he is very good explaining everything in details very good at teaching but i think that his test is hard but he make sure you truly learn and deserve the education that you need from his class a very nice professor
10344,Mike  Dinneen,i took his inline class really fun guy and very helpful made the class challenging and interesting i have learn a lot i highly recommend him you will have to work a lot
10345,Mike  Dinneen,great teacher very funny and will answer any question you have without hesitation highly recommended
10346,Mike  Dinneen,there are tests free response to a rather vague set of questions almost all lecture so you must attend class if you want an a outlines lectures and many aids are on blackboard this is not a blow off class you must work hard if you want an a good instructor though very clear on what he wants and offers ec at end of semester
10347,Mike  Dinneen,mr dineen is an absolutely wonderful instructor he really knows his stuff attendance is a must tests are difficult but if you study you will do good your grade will reflect the effort you put into learning the material he makes learning about politics fun and try to sway us left or right he made us make up our own minds
10348,Mike  Dinneen,this was one of the best courses ever taken he puts so much effort into his lectures and assignments you really learn everything inside and out you must put in the effort and follow his requirements in the syllabus to do well waiting until the last day to do the assignments is not a good idea not an easy a but highly recommend
10349,Mike  Dinneen,he is an absolute amazing teacher you must attend the class he is way better in class than online he truly has a passion for this course but know your stuff he has tests with essays if you do not know the information or slept through lecture you will fail the tests read the textbook i would recommend him any day he is hilarious too
10350,Mike  Dinneen,the class feels like an level class at times due to his demanding nature however you earn every point you get and you get every point you earn attendance is mandatory tests composed of two essays apiece gives possible topics for next test well in advance must be able to think for yourself and be prepared for class tough but fair
10351,Mike  Dinneen,mr dinneen is very intimidating at first i thought it would be a ton of work turns out he was great best teacher i have ever had smart passionate and even funny must go to class
10352,Mike  Dinneen,his class is how any college course should be he is very passionate about his subject and demonstrates so much knowledge the point of the class is to understand our government and as long as you show up review your notes and prepare for class you will succeed in that and it will be interesting expect an easy class this is college
10353,Mike  Dinneen,great teacher
10354,Jeremy  Rosenau,nice guy if you have questions just ask he is someone you really want to put in your network for the future so behave in class
10355,Jeremy  Rosenau,the most boring class ever he goes too fast when lecturing and he grades harshly he did curve our tests however which helped study a lot and try to keep up on reading pretty nice to me just be nice back and try
10356,Jeremy  Rosenau,a nice little guy he wrote the book so he knows what talking about but he will put you to sleep you have no choice though because the only one who teaches this class not bad though just make sure you take notes from his power points and read when he specifically tells you to
10357,Jeremy  Rosenau,really nice guy but the material is boring his tests are hard definitely study more than you normally would he likes detail very helpful teacher though a little forgetful at times his bowties are cute
10358,Jeremy  Rosenau,these classes made me want to jump off a bridge i cannot stand his cocky conservative views on anything the only thing i liked was the project for survery and its relevence to the real world it actually was an important part of my resume
10359,Jeremy  Rosenau,great teacher
10360,Jeremy  Rosenau,this prof really needs to retire.he is just an miserable old man who thinks he is better than you and doesnt need to help you bc you should already know.he is very short with you and mean also is very unclear about every element of the project and then messus up your grades on
10361,Jeremy  Rosenau,not a good grader makes a lot of mistakes in grading powerpoints are boring tests are tough you must study power points other than that not a bad class just keep on top of how grading you
10362,Jeremy  Rosenau,boring and a very difficult grader and loses students work not a very helpful i would not recommend anyone to take him
10363,Jeremy  Rosenau,okay a little nitpicky with the papers nice guy but i dread taking him again i know be several papers involved but he did take us on a day trip to ny that was pretty cool
10364,Jeremy  Rosenau,class sucks
10365,Jeremy  Rosenau,kinda boring with all his powerpoints he does know his stuff very well his test are kinda hard and the project is just annoying
10366,Jeremy  Rosenau,try to buddy up to someone who has taken the class and get them to give you their old project as a reference he is often unclear about what he expects and sometimes thinks you know things that you he is a stickler on grading but ok in general
10367,Jeremy  Rosenau,ok projects thats all only tests
10368,Marvin  Payne,james not many of you should become teachers jesus no just no listening will get you more confused day we were already behind an entire lecture enough said
10369,Marvin  Payne,hes not that great of a teacher he talks about a lot of irrelevant things you learn more about him than you do about the actual subject he does curve but you learn which sucks hes nice but his class and ethic are annoying he teach well his test and lecture correlate just study and stick thru the class
10370,Marvin  Payne,grades easy and is very nice to all students he gets kinda lost in his own lectures sometimes but put up with him and study along side his notes and you should get at least a
10371,Marvin  Payne,great guy really cares about his students stick to the biochem notes and do fine he curves so most people can pass with a c but if you cant get at least a b in his classes you need to become a business major attend lecture because he often cuts lots of material to study
10372,Marvin  Payne,very good looking overall a very very very very easy grader curves like crazy easy c in his class average is a nothing to worry about went to office hours and blew me off though
10373,D.S.  Cody,professor cody is proficient at what he does and his method of teaching is excellent he uses powerpoints and practice questions he ensures that the class has complete understanding of each topic before proceeding to the next he gives assignment for each chapter in an effort to make us practice and review the material on our personal time
10374,D.S.  Cody,on cody on the one hand i got an a but i feel like i taught myself a lot of the material from the book lots of homework very thorough and knows his stuff but he assumes his students are brain dead nonothings and can actually be quite condescending and discouraging i know how you guys are going to do on this test
10375,D.S.  Cody,this teacher was excellent he knows his stuff but dont take advantage i had him a while back you will learn a lot besides italian how could he go wrong
10376,D.S.  Cody,has little respect for students he speaks down to all of us some of us are his same age he also refuses to go over the material in a stepbystep manner he assumes we all know what he is doing
10377,D.S.  Cody,horrible my entire class is lost he go over hw and only has responses to questions google people or this is an upper level class i expect you to know that he has a major ego issue seems to me like he got beat up a lot when he was younger his entire class is reading slide provided by the publisher drop drop now
10378,D.S.  Cody,hard but very fair highly recommend
10379,D.S.  Cody,awesome i loved having him as a professor really good at getting the point across helpful when you understand very organized and nice
10380,D.S.  Cody,very well organized exams were fair but you must do your homeworks and study on your own to do well
10381,D.S.  Cody,this was a challenging class i took it on saturday and sunday from he was the lecture professor and i liked him a lot he was so nice and so clear about what was on his exams there are no surprises
10382,D.S.  Cody,he was my remedial math teacher wayy back great guy easy as hell and then again so was the class total push over caring and nice tries to be entertaining i like him a lot
10383,D.S.  Cody,prof cody comes off a lot more difficult than his class really is in a class that was mandatory for me i dreaded it the typical if you are not dedicated the door well i got the earned the respect of a difficult teacher and learned things always what they seem at first
10384,D.S.  Cody,no comments
10385,D.S.  Cody,runs the chem department like an even shorter napoleon the whole c building is toxic and been inhaling the fumes
10386,D.S.  Cody,this guys a horror all he does is read his slides he never answers a question just plain mean
10387,Teddie  Bonca,excellent professor helpful funny and genuine
10388,Teddie  Bonca,she made me want to be an english major her teaching style and ability is superb i had so much fun with the material and she grades fairly she gives so much help as long as you ask
10389,Teddie  Bonca,first day of class i was intimidated cuz she lets you know right away its going to be a lot expected from you ie grades hard on essays i got and i usually get explain explain explain your thoughts on passages on papers overall i learned a lot take her if u r an english maj
10390,Teddie  Bonca,great teacher she grades hard on papers but is easier on exams she has a passion for literature and one can tell she loves her job
10391,Teddie  Bonca,very nice brilliant yet easy to understand professional and funny will help you if you ask encourages class discussions papers midterm and final
10392,Teddie  Bonca,a ball full of energy this one is she will keep you laughing and interestred in lectures sometimes i found the paper topics a little difficult but they were managable overall good experience
10393,Teddie  Bonca,i really liked her i had her twice and she made me think she does play favorites however but if you participate she will like you she is more about the thought behind things than the technicality of the work you do
10394,Teddie  Bonca,i really enjoyed this class and this professor i thought it was refreshing to read works by female authors especially since male authors tend to be emphasized in english classes
10395,Teddie  Bonca,alot of reading and novels on your own
10396,Teddie  Bonca,she is really nice and passionate about the material but she is so boring i could barely sit through her lectures they way she grades papers is very misleading and inconsistent on one i spent hours making sure it was perfect and i only got a b on another i wrote it in hours and got an a go figure
10397,Teddie  Bonca,excellent class and excellent professor some of the material covered is very tough but dr bonca explained it well i will never love the romantics but she made them understandable great passion for her subject studentfriendly
10398,Teddie  Bonca,much emphasis on unknown female only authors glanced over and skipped prominent male authors to spend time solely on female issues hard grader hard tests journals she collect everyday let the class go early i felt robbed unprepared verbose but lacking in the clasics of the period need some new perspective a universal pc view
10399,Teddie  Bonca,dr bonca is passionate about literature take her class walk away an immense appreciation for the same journals were helpful i definitely used them for writing essays exam prep she reads everything you give her makes herself available to students an amazing person
10400,Teddie  Bonca,does not adjust grading for inclass essays grades as if they are done out of class nitpicks explications journals were pointless because only received feedback on a few majority of journals are collected on the last day of class grading them beforehand would have been helpful
10401,Teddie  Bonca,dr bonca is an amazing professor her love for the literature really shows yes tough on papers but that just means you need to put in extra effort not every class is going to be an easy a definitely worth taking even if you are not interested in the time period she makes it worth it
10402,Teddie  Bonca,helpful clear knowledgeable pleasant i like her a lot i believe most will agree a great professor very accomodating passionate about english take her
10403,Teddie  Bonca,took her my freshman year for english was always helpful to look over my paper and to answer my questions i want to take her for more english classes but she usually teaches at el toro
10404,Teddie  Bonca,no comments
10405,Scott  Churchill,i really enjoy the amount of attention he puts into trying to understand where his students are coming from he is obviously passionate about his subject and has great practical knowledge which brings the philosophical concepts we study down to a workable level for undergrads
10406,Scott  Churchill,if you can follow his classes you will remember them forever.yes he does diverge but most of the important features of the discussion come through understanding these one sided his view is the other side and he does explain both not liberal just practical.he does not force feed you his views of the school are obvious obervations
10407,Scott  Churchill,very interesting very energetic
10408,Scott  Churchill,mcsteamy
10409,Scott  Churchill,dr c is a great guy he is totally approachable and helpful and you can easily your way through his classes
10410,Scott  Churchill,i was very turned off by this individual too bad very very opinionated and take a question for a question and not an attack on his views dedicated to trying to make it through my college career without having him as a teacher
10411,Scott  Churchill,ah the zoo trip need i say more
10412,Scott  Churchill,dr c seems to really love his teaching took us to the zoo and showed us cool stuff with the bonobos he was communicating with them also showed us films and was generally easy to talk with out of class i definitely would take a class with him again the final exam was my favorite
10413,Scott  Churchill,loved it
10414,Scott  Churchill,good
10415,Scott  Churchill,i was really looking forward to my first psych class and he completely turned me off it was a horrible experience he definitely played favorites he constantly complained about the core and was probably just upset that psychology part of it
10416,Scott  Churchill,rants about the state of and dislike for the school frequently which is a bummer often vague or onesided in class lecture i learned most because i had to learn independently in order to defend my positions against his in class learned a lot got an a nonetheless
10417,Scott  Churchill,very enthusiastic interesting lectures on the subject
10418,Sherry  Rodgers,perfect
10419,Sherry  Rodgers,i like the class so far sherry you are the best thanks for all the help
10420,Sherry  Rodgers,she did a nice job of showing us the sea it was fun
10421,Sherry  Rodgers,i really like this class she kicked out some cheaters so that means she cares
10422,Sherry  Rodgers,sherry you are nice and know a lot about ocean life i liked it
10423,Sherry  Rodgers,i really learned a lot in her class
10424,Vickie  Sanchez,sanchez is a total freak talking about sex with college students makes her day if you are a christian or have any set of morals beware she is the most extreme liberal professor ever had i respect the fact that she has an opinion on issues like abortion but she will try to force her extreme liberal views down your neck
10425,Vickie  Sanchez,currently in this class and it sucks its friggin health class so it should be easy and i have to try gah i studied for the last test and do so well even with a study guide be more helpful to know exactly on the test wellness project is easy tho
10426,Vickie  Sanchez,ok so this is health not sex class she is a and needs to learn that there are other classes she has no compassion whatsoever and needs to realize that things come up and she does not have any understanding parts anywhere i wish she would get fired or something
10427,Vickie  Sanchez,loved her she made sure all her students were up to date on assignments and her tests were fairly easy pay attention in class and you will do well
10428,Vickie  Sanchez,talks about her sexual actions and sex way too much
10429,Vickie  Sanchez,her passion is teaching health and human sexuality but if you take her for statistics she still teaches well most of the assignments are easy and quizzes and take home tests are easy too

10435,Vladimir  Tulovsky,very confusing makes the simplest problems so confusing never been taught math in the way that he teaches it better off teaching myself do yourself a favor and take him unless your good at math
10436,Vladimir  Tulovsky,i know how anyone could say he is good he started with chapter of the book which is crazy his test are ridiculously hard even with open book and the study sheet i had to withdraw from the class and get a w because if not i ended with a d no got an a in statistics but failing beginner math silly
10437,Vladimir  Tulovsky,hard to understand with his accent lectures were tough i passed with a even with his review sheets really nice guy though just not recommended unless you know math
10438,Vladimir  Tulovsky,i took his mathematics for liberal arts class and it was ridiculously easy attendance mandatory there are open book exams he gives a review sheet before each exam that is basically the actual exam with the numbers changed he can be pretty unclear at times but if you ask him to explain himself he will
10439,Vladimir  Tulovsky,his lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class he only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine he uses the same exact questions on the midterm and final as the review with different numbers he leaves the room during the test and the class takes the test together
10440,Vladimir  Tulovsky,has an accent but make it any harder to understand open book test play around because of it though open book math is not easy
10441,Vladimir  Tulovsky,very thick russian accent sometimes hard to understand overall a great professor explains in detail and will gladly reexplain anything not sure on attendance is not mandatory nor is doing homework tests make up your grade and they are all open book open notes plus he usually gives a takehome test after to help boost your grade
10442,Vladimir  Tulovsky,i know how people can say hes good his tests are the review changed but its still not understandable at all nothing but tests count towards ur grade had no idea what i was doing in his class really brought down my gpa
10443,Vladimir  Tulovsky,tulovsky is the best teacher at st johns teaches really well easy a take him if you can
10444,Vladimir  Tulovsky,i love this teacher seriously i hate math and cannot understand his silly accent but the tests are a breeze show up the day before for the review and you will get an a no questions
10445,Vladimir  Tulovsky,thick accent but easy open note open book take home tests be much easier to get an a then that in other words he is the man
10446,Vladimir  Tulovsky,very easy a open book tests just do the homework and ask him to review it in class if you know anything let him know open book tests include your notes and textbook which is great great professor
10447,Vladimir  Tulovsky,no comments
10448,Vladimir  Tulovsky,best professor open note tests lets u cheat doesnt take attendance after about first weeks of class does a review before every test easy a if u have smart friends

10453,Vladimir  Tulovsky,the best class ever u dont have to go his test are open book and u can cheat class is a joke easy a
10454,Vladimir  Tulovsky,good math teacher tests are open book open note everyone in the class got caught cheating and he just laughed russian accent can get hard at times bunch of kids snickered when he pronounced theta teeta just do the homework
10455,Karen  Camarata,sound informative and very interesting does bring family home life into class but always puts them in context of lessons being taught love her
10456,Karen  Camarata,she sucks
10457,Karen  Camarata,i loved taking her class although she likes to talk about her kids she deserves it sounds like theyve been through it but she is a really good teacher and if you need help she will give it if you ask she also has a good sense of humor the best
10458,Karen  Camarata,online course had lots of quizes had to read the book but teacher was helpful
10459,Karen  Camarata,she lost my take home final had to retake it with out notes or a book my grade went from a to a b
10460,Karen  Camarata,where do i start camarata is unorganized scatterbrained and not intouch with reality she spends if not all the majority of class time talking about the problems she has with her children avoid her classes at all costs i learn anything from semesters worth of classes

10464,Jerry  Colasurdo,got an a in his sociology winter class he has a very abrasive personality get in your face and ask you rude questions sometimes his remarks are stereotypes which will offend you overall his tests too bad make sure you read the book and review it he does give home tests use these to your advantage

10470,Jerry  Colasurdo,who hired this guy worst class i have ever taken.long illogical makes up hard follow.he also changes what he says as if what he said all alongincluding when assignments r due.wants u learn.got an a but it was torture
10471,Jerry  Colasurdo,funny at times tries to make the fun interesting he make become repetitive but he does have good lectures sometimes has tests questions and a final gives you the pre test for each one of those tests he might change about or answers from pre test ready the guy
10472,Jerry  Colasurdo,his test is hard the pretest is not helpful a lot there are multichoices questions which drive me crazy
10473,Jerry  Colasurdo,great teacher do all ur work study and get an a
10474,Jerry  Colasurdo,he is enthusiastic and loud he doesnt like late people and you better have your book with you at every class too much work in the class for a ge credit too many written essay assignments and quizes the tests are the same as the pretests and then change later
10475,Jerry  Colasurdo,hes cooler than a fan a little strange but thats what makes the class fun gotta keep up on your work or screw you later lots of essays but he gives you a long time to finish take home test to help you out because of his style of teaching the whole class ends up pretty close hes o

10479,Jerry  Colasurdo,boringg teacherr grades easyy exams and da final
10480,Jerry  Colasurdo,very enthusiastic about what teaching but sadly closeminded although tolerant of dissent teaches pretty much to the very generous grading policy

10482,Jerry  Colasurdo,makes learning extremly fun sometimes give to many essays buy forgive him hard to get a word in sometimes time really flies in this class for once learning was enjoyable
10483,Derick  Holcomb,he is an amazing professor his tests hard at all he does have web assignments due every week but easy he is hilarious he makes jokes all the time but i genuinely laugh awesome class very interesting material i would recommend him times
10484,Derick  Holcomb,amazing teacher easy class does attendance every class and believe in teaching on fridays there are two paragraph papers due every wednesday over interesting topics you are free to have opinions he judge really funny and will help you if needed even though you have a textbook you only need it for study guides

10486,Derick  Holcomb,he straight gives you the answers to the test so if you listen get a you have easy papers every week easy a and he does not have class on fridays even though it is mwf
10487,Derick  Holcomb,this class was by the far the easiest class i have ever taken at eku dr holcomb is very nice a little weird but you will learn to love him and make sure you go to every class no class on fridays and do your web assignments and complete your wellness project and theres no way you can get anything less than a b
10488,Derick  Holcomb,his class was cake we were scheduled to meet mwf but we only ever met on mw his class is easy and you really have to do anything to do well other than your wellness project which still that hard
10489,Derick  Holcomb,everyday is a class discussion super easy you have an easier class he takes attendance everyday but only has class on mon wed for the mwf class you turn in a two paragraph research paper instead of coming on friday so simple he reads off the answers for his tests so write down what he says easy a
10490,Derick  Holcomb,so easy highly recommend mwf class but he does not have class fridays instead you have to write two paragraphs on a given topic and super nice and virtually no work involved with the class and he tells you word for word what will be on the test easiest class ever
10491,Derick  Holcomb,he is feet of pure awesomeness definitely recommended you will never stress about this class he relates to the kids no class on fridays no final and he only takes off one point if you show up for class but you do learn a lot if you do
10492,Derick  Holcomb,he is is real laid back.a study guide for the exams is included in the syllabus.right before the exams he will walk you through every question and he tells the answer to each one you must right a little paragraph paper on a current topic that he includes in the syllabus.in return for this he cancels class for a day he is extermely easy

10497,Derick  Holcomb,definitely a freshman level class talks about beginner level discussions boring
10498,Derick  Holcomb,he is a great professor no class on friday and hardly any work the work is easy and so are the exams i highly recommend taking a class taught by dr holcomb
10499,Derick  Holcomb,super easy he does take attendance but told me that he only counts off one point every day you come and you do have to write the little half page papers every week but he also only counts off one point for not doing those too i think i only did two and went to class about of the time had a b
10500,Derick  Holcomb,entertaining professor class is mandatory but not at all boring or difficult to sit through one major health assignment two tests and one take home final very easy pretty fun and a kind and understanding professor no class on fridays either you write two paragraphs a week on a health topic instead
10501,Derick  Holcomb,love this class we never had friday classes instead you have to write a little one page paper every week on a different curent topic very easy a if you do the papers we only had two test which had study guides and they were all multipule choice he is a funny guy who understand that this is a gen ed class and is willing to work with students t
10502,Derick  Holcomb,super easy really funny guy have class on fridays
10503,Michael  Ballard,dr ballard is a very interesting person he plays advocate with you a lot the hea class too hard with him he seems to become selfabsorbed in his own ideals in lecture at times the tests are multiple choice and short answer usually making flash cards over content is fine for studying you have to work but not too hard
10504,Michael  Ballard,unrealistic avoid him he is so struck on himself that he does not lecture on important material he likes hearing himself talk he is interesting but a joke too
10505,Michael  Ballard,great professor prepared prompt interesting and fair he is to the point and business like but is very open to students and helping solve problems.he does answer emails but very quick and direct i would recommend to anyone he tries hard to make material relevant and include all of class in discussion
10506,Michael  Ballard,he is a great teacher his teaching methods are awesome and he will help you out a lot if you are interested in a health major i would definitely recommend him
10507,Michael  Ballard,i really liked him his tests were long but not difficult he is open to listen to your opinion during discussions and the project is pretty easy i recomend him
10508,Michael  Ballard,i enjoyed his class yes his tests were slightly difficult but if you study the material be ok he graded the wellness projects pretty easy too he really knows what talking about i would recommend him to anyone
10509,Michael  Ballard,no he responed to emails but he is a pretty cool guy and a good teacher
10510,Michael  Ballard,ballard is the man he only gives you one homework assignment for the entire semester though the tests are questions long often over many chapters at a time meaning if you just read the chapters have no problem plus funny
10511,Michael  Ballard,his tests are way too complicated and he respond to email messages
10512,Michael  Ballard,he doesnt explain anything he a very good teacher
10513,Michael  Ballard,he is funny plus he give much homework
10514,Michael  Ballard,dr ballard has a dry sense of humor so sorta funny has a lot of class discussion and always plays advocate tests are way too hard and a tough grader on articles
10515,Michael  Ballard,no comments
10516,Wm. David  Sloan,i believe he has a bad rating on here i loved dr sloan and he was always really eager to help
10517,Wm. David  Sloan,sloan is not only the best professor in the world he is the best person.if you value truth intellect and sincerity you will love and learn so muich from dr sloan he had done so much meaningful research and written so many books and articles if you have the privilege of being in his class you are lucky lucky lucky
10518,Wm. David  Sloan,horrible i dropped this class a few weeks in and my entire load of the semester was cut in half too much busy work and talk about boring
10519,Wm. David  Sloan,sloan expects you to produce the best work of your college career when you have absolutely no earthly idea what the assignment is or means give me a break
10520,Wm. David  Sloan,sloan even give you a chance to raise your grade i took this class senior year missed two quizzes out of and he told me to drop it or he would give me an automatic f sloan needs to give students some time i was also a high b student

10522,Kec  Keller,simply put the finest history professor i have ever had
10523,Kec  Keller,keine sorgen mein wirst bestimmt eine bessere stelle finden
10524,Kec  Keller,the classes he taught before getting finding out getting fired were amazing definitely one of the best professors but gotten bad this semester blame him since he is losing his job
10525,Kec  Keller,prof keller is a fair professor who values class participation also willing to help a student out or be flexible if a student has problems
10526,Kec  Keller,no comments
10527,Kec  Keller,very good
10528,Kec  Keller,no comments
10529,Kec  Keller,no comments
10530,Kec  Keller,great instructor kind of a coneshaped head though
10531,Larry  Cox,this guy was ok but you have to work hard he curves tests which is his only saving grace i have a lot of trouble sometimes because he was very unclear about subject matter but after all i guess its economics
10532,Larry  Cox,if you show up for class and pay attention you can get a good grade in this class attendance is very important in this class when a bunch of people skip class he sometimes gives additional points to people who showed up
10533,Larry  Cox,nice guy funny hard to pay attention though
10534,Larry  Cox,very easy class makes it fun
10535,Larry  Cox,technical
10536,Larry  Cox,he explain anything most people get on the tests horrible teacher
10537,Peter  Geib,simple and easy to follow class there are not a lot of things graded just group projects and two tests so it was quite easy to keep up with the only mandatory attendance is when the group projects are presented
10538,Peter  Geib,although his lectures are long and dry dr geib is good guy in this class you will give presentations write research papers terms and essay tests super flexible and willing to help his students
10539,Peter  Geib,while class is very dry and can be somewhat long he actually cares about his students and is always willing to help you out a good guy
10540,Peter  Geib,geib knows what talking about and is very passionate grades consist of group short essays and tests on important terms
10541,Peter  Geib,a really great teacher that really cares about the subject matter and his students
10542,Peter  Geib,geib is a great guy and is very knowledgeable when it comes to management the class is focused on two case study projects and two exams so there is not a whole lot of extra work other than these his lecture and discussion sessions sometimes get a little boring but overall it was a good class
10543,Peter  Geib,geib is awesome basically there are just two projects and two test during class and the rest of the time is just discussion this class can be an easy a if you show up and study whenever necessary which is very little
10544,Peter  Geib,nice guy good teacher cares about his students and encourages everyone to continue their education past graduation
10545,Peter  Geib,good easy going guy realy boreing tho you will fall asleep
10546,Peter  Geib,nice guy easy going
10547,Peter  Geib,geib is pretty easy but his lectures are really really boring super nice guy though easy class to take if you can keep from falling asleep
10548,Peter  Geib,nice guy talks too much sometimes but is very knowledgable

10551,Peter  Geib,tests and group research projects is all
10552,Peter  Geib,geib is a genius
10553,Michelle  Burnham,did not offer enough written assignments
10554,Michelle  Burnham,i felt penalized for my opinions the assignments required very little work but were graded harshly the final exam was ambiguous in the classroom i felt overworked and undervalued
10555,Michelle  Burnham,she is good intentioned but she has pretty unclear assignments and grade easily she is smart but the in class discussions are boring i recommend her for engl
10556,Michelle  Burnham,the readings for this class are a bit confusing and really theoretical but she does a pretty good job going over them in class papers rough draft for each which are for credit and her feedback is helpful in class thinking papers are the hardest part as she grades them similar to a real paper organized class handwriting hard to decipher
10557,Michelle  Burnham,prof burnham is great she is very interested in helping her students grow and learn go to her office hours because she is very helpful there
10558,Michelle  Burnham,a great teacher she encourages class discussion and taught fairly well considering it was her first time teaching the course tons of reading though no real exams final is a take home very fair grader when it comes to essays and always willing to help
10559,Michelle  Burnham,great professor she will really help you out with essays if you go to her office hours
10560,Michelle  Burnham,a good teacher but go to office hours and ask her to help you with your paper you learn more in her office than in class.a pretty meaty amount of reading but not too bad
10561,Michelle  Burnham,great teacher leads discussions well fair grader
10562,Michelle  Burnham,difficult if you have a passion for english lit she will realy teach you how to write well and she is a very fair and constant grader no surprises
10563,Michelle  Burnham,if you are a feminista who is tired of reading the important works of past sign up for class it is difficult to make a class of alternative voices relevant and interesting and this is no exception all for diversity but the sad fact is that there just very many written pieces by but you will read many by tem anyway
10564,Michelle  Burnham,very intelligent lady but you have to write the way she wants you to write seems like a bit bored with teaching but still an okay professor heavy work load but a fair grader
10565,Michelle  Burnham,great teacher overall
10566,Michelle  Burnham,she is very dry and boring the work is tedious and she seem to bring any enthusiasm or real insight to the subject also she told me i go to grad school because i make it guess where i am now
10567,Michelle  Burnham,not a good professor emphasizes obscurity of sources rather than quality and is very unclear about assignments
10568,Michelle  Burnham,dr burnham has an excellent grasp of the beauty and complexity of the romantic age of american lit
10569,Chris  Hoyt,this course was engaging and prof hoyt is very well prepared for class make sure to read everything he tells you to read it will help you with the pop quizzes as long as you stay on top of things you will do great in this course prof hoyt is also very understanding and cares about your opinions and thoughts
10570,Chris  Hoyt,make you buy a book that you really should buy i got it for on amazon he tends to ramble and can be pretentious sometimes and the three hour time slot is annoying but overall i really liked this class this convinced me to take more phil classes a quiz every class and a movie before all of them i only wish it was earlier in the day
10571,Chris  Hoyt,hoyt will have you read at least pages for every class however you will only ever get through about pages worth of discussion rambles on and on when asking questions is searching for something so specific he just keeps asking people until he gets close or we run out of time
10572,Chris  Hoyt,he is beautiful but not hot get a grip reviewers we even had this discussion in class he is very caring he is willing to help you are allowed flashcards on exams but i did not find that helpful his exams are very hard i would be making a much better grade if it was not for the tests you will spend lots of money on printing
10573,Chris  Hoyt,a good teacher and is really cool he is hilarious and class is normally fun
10574,Chris  Hoyt,there is reading every night during almost every class there is a quiz on what was read only two tests midterm and final and a few other writing assignments can be a very tough grader wants depth but wants you to be very concise too very hard to achieve
10575,Chris  Hoyt,he will work with you but be ready to work
10576,Chris  Hoyt,super cute and is really passionate about his courses he expects a lot out of you so if willing to put in the effort well worth taking one of his courses extremely blunt and has a fun approach to philosophy
10577,Chris  Hoyt,he is a fantastic teacher take him
10578,Chris  Hoyt,personally he is an alright guy but his grading is a bit ridiculous for a level class and he expects a lot from that kinda class its not the best class in the world but if you read you may be okay he gives a few essays over the course and if you can bs it enough and let him look at it you should be alright read everything carefully
10579,Chris  Hoyt,fun in class but ridiculous grading
10580,Chris  Hoyt,i think he higher ratings because girls tend to think cute an okay teacher definitely not the best in the department but i think a bit full of himself and pretty rude
10581,Chris  Hoyt,he is an awesome teacher that is passionate about the subjects in class he def knows what he is talking about he is helpful when it comes to writing the papers for the class papers are hard but it is a level class so that is to be expected also for a bonus he is really hot
10582,Chris  Hoyt,dr hoyt is very intelligent and familiar with the class material the material is not but he takes time to discuss and explain it until you get it he seems like a very kind and sincere person i think he is a great professor
10583,Chris  Hoyt,i like hoyt as a person and have a lot of respect for his intelligence however i think he might be the most boring philosophy teacher ever had he talks so slow and quiet that you just pay attention he could also make the most intense sex scandal seem abnoxiously bland and boring
10584,Chris  Hoyt,thumbs up
10585,Chris  Hoyt,beautiful with the brains to match this is a hard course lots of material and different ways of thinking but i have loved every minute of it hilarious and cynical and too damn normal to be a philosophy teacher good class excellent teacher happy
10586,Chris  Hoyt,had him for a few classes i like his teaching style he explains things in different ways to try and help everyone understand if you struggle with phil try harder or take phil classes you just have to read and participate in the class discussions for any of his classes and it will start to make more sense def one of my fav profs
10587,Chris  Hoyt,i would take him again is that not enough he has office hours and is there and will talk with you about concerns projects et c is that not enough he knows what he is talking about there take the class
10588,Chris  Hoyt,hoyt is a good teacher this class is a little difficult especially if you take the honors level but the class is very helpful not a normal philosophy class about your opinions its simply about logic and reasoning hoyt sometimes has difficulty explaining the info however this may be because the info is diffucult i would take him again
10589,Howard  Shorr,dude blows
10590,Howard  Shorr,lectures are very informative and interesting want students to you write a lot even though not worth much towards grade tests are okay kind of hard ot study for
10591,Howard  Shorr,entertaining lecturer enjoyed his class very much
10592,Howard  Shorr,class was enjoyable shorr gets a bad rap for getting upset when students talk raising their hands but his lectures are involved and straight off the top of his head so he like being taken off track be a respectable student who pays attention and do fine he speaks fast so be sure you can keep up note taking
10593,Howard  Shorr,mr shorr is a freak he yells at students who raise their hands i always felt scared to breathe let alone speak he has anger management issues and often seemed like he was about to pull a dr david banner and turn green and rip his shirt off beware i got an a but it was an ordeal
10594,Howard  Shorr,the exam format seems to be a trend of history profs the fact that he require you to talk is a bonus since you then get participation points for free raising your hand is a courtesy thing since i pay to listen to him and not someone that once took a trip somewhere packed with knowledge and was fun to learn from
10595,Howard  Shorr,this dude gave us like tests the entire term and that was all of our assignments he talked for about hours nonstop without asking for any student participation while he is a knowledgable teacher he know how to teach
10596,Howard  Shorr,mr shorr has interesting lectures he knows his stuff worry too much about memorizing his lectures study the guides he gives you and you will ace the tests he is intimidating and likes to be the boss raise your hand and he wont yell at you
10597,Greg  Heberling,constantly singing very active brings tremendous energy to the classroom minimal pointless memorization and wasted time
10598,Greg  Heberling,heb is a great guy but not the best prof you can learn from him but if econ is not your thing and you will need some better teaching you should try another prof
10599,Greg  Heberling,heb is one of the best at au he not only is a professor but is also a business man he knows his information you can learn a lot from heb
10600,Greg  Heberling,this prof seems great at first but ends up being terrible he has one funny joke a class but the rest is just rambling for attention.because he takes so much time telling stories when the test comes around you are clueless stay away from this professor
10601,Greg  Heberling,very fun professor he makes going to class fun and you still learn from him he is also on the students side ex if you think you should have done better on a test talk with him and he will most likely give you some extra points i want to take as many classes with him as i can
10602,Greg  Heberling,heb is attrative but still the wild child of the business dept he is hilarious
10603,Greg  Heberling,love this guy
10604,Greg  Heberling,no comments
10605,Greg  Heberling,he is very helpful and is willing to give his time to you he also lets class decide if they want to be there or not at times
10606,Greg  Heberling,do a diddy diddy dum diddy do
10607,Greg  Heberling,he is an easy professor but you have to follow the examples he gives sometimes they make sence to him but just get everyone else lost he is willing to help ouside of class but good luck catching him
10608,Greg  Heberling,funny

10626,Andrew  Preston,geat prof he is by far the most intelligent prof ever had be prepared to read alot a very hard marker and expects you to participate in all discussions his lectures are full of info so be prepared to write alot and quickly

10628,Andrew  Preston,great prof tests are extremely fair fun to listen to and i only have one thing negative to say lose the green cord pants
10629,Andrew  Preston,dudes a good teacher lol at las comment he knows his like no other plus hes young and is one of those profs who is actually smarter than the students in his class good dude
10630,Andrew  Preston,good prof but would be a great travel agent
10631,Philip  Harsha,midterm was extremely hard clarify what you need to be studying at all
10632,Philip  Harsha,this class seemed like a blow off class there are barely any grades we had like assignments a midterm and a presentation attendance is what he grades on but only of the grade the midterm was outrageous and pretty sure the average curve was the only teacher for this class unfortunately nice guy though
10633,Philip  Harsha,this was the worst graduate class i have ever taken at missouri state university the professor has checked out of school and should not be teaching please avoid this class if at all possible i spent over hours a week teaching myself and others
10634,Philip  Harsha,great professor laughs at his own jokes pay for my accounting lab and use it he grades fair but does require you to know the material
10635,Philip  Harsha,good teacher go on and on like some professors got the point pretty quickly
10636,Philip  Harsha,never prepared for class
10637,Philip  Harsha,excellent
10638,Philip  Harsha,he explain things clearly very boring
10639,John  Handy,dudes from the bronx so he dont play that lol next gonna be his last so take him while still here a great connect letters of recc as for the class its straightforward makes it super easy on us he only gave exams he drops the lowest doubles the highest always available for help he really cares about his students

10642,John  Handy,he is a great professor he teaches somewhat fast but is honestly there to help you he will make the class doable as long as you do your part by far best teacher in the economics department
10643,John  Handy,very cool teacher that you can relate to his test are hard and you must put alot of effort to pass the class and understand the material

10645,John  Handy,no comments
10646,John  Handy,excellent professor really cares about students gaining alot of knowledge from his classes he was also very helpful
10647,John  Handy,no comments
10648,Gretchan  Van Lente,labels all students to her general observation of the class not understanding about family emergencies
10649,Gretchan  Van Lente,a truly student orientated and dedicated to the art of learning a real class individual and consummate professional
10650,Gretchan  Van Lente,no comments
10651,Gretchan  Van Lente,gretchen is a talented writer with a good sense of other works applicable to course material expectations are high but usually so are results older women are hotter
10652,Gretchan  Van Lente,is very helpful the entire way wants anyone who tries to pass with a b or better
10653,Duane  Griffin,i took this course in a freshman only class and he was trying to help us out but very successful i definitely recommend the course mainly because of the second half of the semester project the first half is all earth science and he tends to stop himself and restart a lot kind of all over the place nice guy though willing to help
10654,Duane  Griffin,i have never been more disappointed in my life i have never met a more arrogant person in my life i regret taking this class this class and this professor are completely disjointed to blatantly and constantly reject student opinion is not how you tech a class
10655,Duane  Griffin,i have never known an educator more selfabsorbed than griffin his classes when not completely empty of substance involve lectures pertaining to topics that only he would find relevant no clarity in assignments or grading criteria a discouraging presence in the classroom
10656,Duane  Griffin,quite possibly the worst class ever taken his tests do not cover the material presented in lecture he like athletes and is unconcerned with out of people failing
10657,Duane  Griffin,terrible professor expected students to know information for tests that he even teach about it awful grading system i will never take a class with this professor again and advise no one else to either
10658,Duane  Griffin,hey was horrible expected you to understand everything the first time he spoke of something if you are struggling he makes things harder and expects more if your an athlete do not take this class
10659,Duane  Griffin,duane is a little quirky and kind of out there but overall a great professor i took this class as a sophomore and expected to get my butt kicked really helpful though and wants you to do well he really give many grades and tests were very general field trips are interesting definitely a lot of work but it been a lot worse
10660,Duane  Griffin,grades harshly and not clear on all assignments he clearly is very intelligent and expects you to understand everything you say the first time through the class could have been really interesting but he ruined it oh and do not tell him your an athlete guaranteeing a low grade from the start
10661,Duane  Griffin,not clear at all about
10662,Duane  Griffin,he is a really nice guy if you try hard in his class and stay on top of the assignments he asks of you then you will seriously do well try to get on his good side it pays off he is a really smart guy and is very willing to help you out if you need go to office hours it makes him take you seriously and you learn a lot from his genius
10663,Duane  Griffin,take advantage of extra credit opportunities and office hours there is a lot of material but the tests ask about broad trends and general connections so just memorizing that helpful he is kind of a picky grader field trips are kind of random but fun and he has a lot of jokes and interesting stories so the class is laid back and fun
10664,Duane  Griffin,such a funny guy love him he is a genius and is a bit confusing when he talks about the subject matter he is really into what he teaches as long as you try hard in the class you will do well even if you do bad on exams show effort that you care about the class and meet with him though if you dont understand
10665,Duane  Griffin,the whole time i thought i was going to fail and even considered withdrawing after basically failing all the impossible exams however he gives so many extra credit opportunities that only require your attendance and he makes group projects worth a ton so i actually ended up doing well in the class his grades seem subjective just try hard
10666,Duane  Griffin,do not take him if you can avoid it a deans list student great gpa and took him and it dropped my average significantly if you just need a lab credit do anything else to avoid this so mad the reviews didnt warn me enough people are right he is quirky and sometimes nice but overall his tests are impossible and he is not helpful at all
10667,Duane  Griffin,great class he never said hed curve the grades high score earned in teh class sets the top of hte scale and its down from that for each grade totally fair but science majors set the top i did ok xcept for the final shouldve studied more cuz it killed me learned a lot tho makes you think
10668,Duane  Griffin,perhaps just the class that is hard because i know what everyone else is whining about duane is an absolute genius when it comes to problemsolving and abstract thinking and he looks at the subject matter in such an interesting fresh way he is a fair grader and not hard to do well if you study your book and hilarious
10669,Duane  Griffin,great class if you love weather great prof if you want to learn take if looking for an easy lab credit his class really should be level because its a serious science class weather is a lot of physics small number of majors set the high grades and the rest of us got screwed
10670,Duane  Griffin,this is the worst teacher ever had in my entire life he was useless do not take he told us not to worry about our grades however he screwed us all in the end and gave us lower grades than everyone expected avoid at all costs for your own good
10671,Duane  Griffin,from what i gather classes before mine seemed to have taken advantage of duane or at least he felt like they did so then he made it too difficult not worth the stress esp if you reading humidity graphs and such is not going to be part of your life in the future stay away
10672,Duane  Griffin,cool guy but we were told he would scale grades at the end esp considering most of the class was getting averages on the tests but he didnt curve in the end interesting class but in the end it ended up hurting my gpa and just causing more stress in my life not worth it if simply searching for another lab science credit
10673,J  Rogers,dr rogers is one of the most encouraging kind professors i have ever had and cares more about you learning the material than passing a test which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it studying is all important there is a quiz every lecture and lab he is generous with grades if you show determination and come to class
10674,J  Rogers,dr rogers is a very nice person going to class helps out a lot because at the end of the semester if close to going up a grade he looks at attendance he also gives extra credit opportunities through quizes at the end of the semester
10675,J  Rogers,this class was hard a lot of information but he is willing to work with you and he is always around in case you have questions if you have to take this class i strongly recommend taking it with rogers
10676,J  Rogers,he is a really good teacher he gives extra credit and curves some test he is there to help anyone who needs it he uses powerpoint and that is super useful his test are super hard but passable you just have to study your but off this class in general is not easy
10677,J  Rogers,his lectures were clean and helpful his powerpoints really help on the test and also his extra notes on web ct go to all the labs and stay after with him to help you in lab he curves but the test are really hard
10678,J  Rogers,good professor very helpful and easy on papers tests are hard but not impossible
10679,J  Rogers,i had him for a p and in summer school this class in summer school is the worst idea ever but he made the class so intresting he is overly helpful gives lots of extra credit and loves going into detail to help everyone highly recommened i have a better understanding of the classes im taking now from his class
10680,J  Rogers,i think he is a great teacher and always willing to help you this is not an easy class but he is the best to teach it be prepared to study a lot and work hard take him
10681,J  Rogers,this class is super hard only because there is so much material if you arent intrested in studying all the time then you are in the wrong major tell from the get go there will be or as bs alot of cs and ds and some es unless you just do great on the test expect to fall into the range like everyone else
10682,J  Rogers,by far the best teacher i have had at ru he is amazing he will help you out the best that he can all you have to do is ask him for anything that you may need take him if you have to take anatomy
10683,J  Rogers,dr rogers is by far the best professor that i have had since been here he is extremely helpful and the sweetest man ever it is a hard class and you do have to work but a hard class to begin with very highly recommended
10684,J  Rogers,dr rogers is the sweetest man ever he is definitly willing to work with you if you feel you are behind if you have to take anatomy do your best to get him all tests are multiple choice including lab practicals as far as i know the other teachers have essay tests he is such a sweetheart and an amazing teacher
10685,J  Rogers,dr rogers is the best professor had so far if you need help with anything all you have to do is ask the exams are very hard but that is to be expected with an anatomy class i thought the lab practicals were much easier than the lecture exams
10686,J  Rogers,dr rogers is the best teacher i have ever had he is the nicest man and is always willing to help you anytime his tests are hard but if you study like a week in advance you should do well he is so cute and i definetly recommend him over any other teacher who teaches anatomy and physiology
10687,J  Rogers,dr rogers is extrememly helpful and if you go to him he will help you in anyway i went to him so many times and he was so nice to me if you show him you care then he will help and if not willing to talk to him then complain
10688,J  Rogers,tests are very hard need to study every little thing in your notes it will be on there take lots of notes in lecture i am in his summer class almost hours and on average take pages of notes willing to help if you need it
10689,J  Rogers,hes the best teacher ive ever had hot too
10690,J  Rogers,tests are hard but what else could you expect very helpful you just have to ask if you are looking to know this stuff the professor to take
10691,J  Rogers,ok not as helpful as the others say he is picks favorites
10692,J  Rogers,i agree dr rogers is a great professor and i have learned alot from him he is very willing to help you just have to ask he definately knows what talking about i recommend him too
10693,Richard  Bodek,rich bodek is the best teacher at this school he is so intelligent and passionate about what he does and gets really excited when students are engaged he really cares about students and have tests or quizzes you just have to read every night its such an interesting class and he really makes you want to learn
10694,Richard  Bodek,i took his class in the summer and hate history but i loved this class because he was hilarious and told really funny stories about his life that related to the topic he lectures a lot but interesting because a quirky man also a pretty grader
10695,Richard  Bodek,dr bodek is very knowledgeable and his lectures are filled with anecdotes and details very pleasant just keep in mind that you must take notes at all times because there is no textbook for the weimar germany class other than two compilations of readings
10696,Richard  Bodek,excellent prof i took it as a summer course and we had to jam through the whole course but he kept things lively and even though he had so much material to cover in almost no time take his class again he mind if you get the previous edition of the book either saved me
10697,Richard  Bodek,dr bodek is seriously one of the best professors at cofc his lectures are amazing and his class was very clear cut he can acknowledge when assigned too much work and mind moving assignments around to better fit the classes needs i would take him for anything he offers
10698,Richard  Bodek,i had dr bodek for my fysewar trauma and culture and he was an awesome teacher he is really enthusiastic about the subject and has a lot of knowledge about it he is a very easy grader as long as you follow the simple criteria a lot of reading was necessary but no tests or finals great teacher easy class would definitely recommend
10699,Richard  Bodek,excellent professor really knows his topic and imparts his enthusiasm to his students highly recommended
10700,Richard  Bodek,one of my favorite teachers so smart really loves what he teaches and will gladly help you if you go see him the only downside is that he does assign a lot of reading
10701,Richard  Bodek,great teacher interesting lectures papers no final
10702,Richard  Bodek,my favorite professor at cofc he is brilliant gives very interesting lectures and is an all around great guy i wish i had more history credits remaining so i could take him again
10703,Richard  Bodek,i learned so much
10704,Richard  Bodek,the best
10705,Richard  Bodek,this was an honors special topics course and it was amazing it was discussion based and team taught dr bodek is one of the best teachers at the college very nice and very helpful really makes you think outside the box and has really interesting ideas very animated and enthusiastic highly recommended for any honors class
10706,Richard  Bodek,very very smart basically knows everything about history and can answer any question give quizzes and assigned homework so if you bomb a paper or test then you are done for participate in class because he likes that a lot he will grade you on that and he will call on you even if you arent raising your hand pretty funny too
10707,Richard  Bodek,really a nice guy taken him twice now and just had a blast socialism was very difficult a lot of the theory material was waay over my head but he will stop class to explain all material and some side stories as well those are the best i feel like i learned more from discussion than actually reading really a great professor
10708,Richard  Bodek,extremely nice man very knowledgable and helpful the class was somewhat difficult simply because it hops around so much every week was not coherent at all you never really know what hes going to talk about
10709,Richard  Bodek,very nice teacher funny always a discussion class he brings viewpoints from theorists and get deep into their mind you really are there for the teacher the readings are sometimes difficult to understand.not too structured of a class always flips around subjects
10710,Richard  Bodek,this guy was probably the coolest professor ever he knows everything about everything completely a people person he seemed to know interesting facts about very uninteresting facts the best lectures ever that required you to really think outside of the box if you go to his office hours and ask questions help you lots
10711,Richard  Bodek,he truly thinks we have nothing else to do but read one of the assigned books page chapters and internet reading every night this man thinks our entire lives are history the only part of the class that isnt terrible is the take home midterm and final dont take this professor unless you are a history buff who has no life
10712,Richard  Bodek,really smart funny guy excellent teacher very knowledgeable expect to read a lot though our class because of a bookstore issue but traditionally he is very big on the reading
10713,Craig  Wedderspoon,what a nice man he cares about his students and is so helpful with assignments he is very approachable and wants to help you when you adk questions or need inspiration i was out sick for a while and he was so nice about it definitely take him
10714,Craig  Wedderspoon,this is the second class taken with craig and i have learned so much he is a tough grader but the very nature of sculpture is difficult if your hard work is apparent he will notice but you have to really try to get an a in his class attendance is mandatory like all studio classes and final documentation is also a big part of your grade
10715,Craig  Wedderspoon,craig works hard at helping his students achieve thier maximum potential you will get out of it what you put into it i learned a great deal from him
10716,Craig  Wedderspoon,he is really nice and class is fun however grades are just given on how he feels you did so make sure to try and show up to class not sure how hard he expects you to work but an a is very difficult to achieve
10717,Craig  Wedderspoon,try as hard as you can he grades on effort if you do a lot he notices
10718,Craig  Wedderspoon,craig is hard to understand at times he will go out of his way to help you then he will go off on you for the smallest things his temper gets in the way of his teaching i learned a lot from craig but the most important thing i learned was how not to treat people
10719,Craig  Wedderspoon,he has high expectations and a strict attendance policy etc but he knows his subject well and is really helpful if you show interest if you follow the rules and actually do the work you get a lot out of the class i thought he was awesome and pretty funny sometimes too if you want to take an art class recommend him
10720,Craig  Wedderspoon,its kinda hard to get an a in his class
10721,Craig  Wedderspoon,loved this class he is a great teacher and so much fun
10722,Craig  Wedderspoon,he was fun and a great teacher
10723,Craig  Wedderspoon,no comments
10724,Sally Jayne  Gilpin,if you suck up do fine get on her good side listen to what she has to say and repeat it restate her thoughts in question form and you will get an a ask her about her childhood marriage and kids her birthday is nov remember that throw her a party this is how you will succeed in class
10725,Sally Jayne  Gilpin,she does not let you use big words she is stupid and mean she gets mad when you talk or try to have a little bit of fun not a good class
10726,Sally Jayne  Gilpin,all i hear all day is how she teach and how easy her class is i wish that she would let us use our expansive vocabulary to further our education
10727,Sally Jayne  Gilpin,i am smarter than she is she has a very little vocabulary she is sarcastic in an annoying way she should do students a favor by quitting
10728,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,class is very interesting and challenging itself simply very frustrating to work with when he respond to emails and lesson plans seem to be made as he goes very bad on feedback throughout the semester as i never received my first test back or any labs to let me know how i was doing very very frustrating
10729,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,nice and funny guy make the materials easier and fun to learn
10730,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,clear lectures straightforward expectations knows the material
10731,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,i think i would like this class at all but it turned out to be one of my favorites he has a good sense of humor and answered any questions clearly the homework was tough and took a lot of time but doing it made the tests easy
10732,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,professor jeremy van antwerp spent the first minutes of each minute lecture talking about comic books and telling anecdotes he did not seem to take his responsibility as a teacher seriously he was rarely available for assistance with assigned material and was generally unhelpful in my opinion he was immature and unprofessional
10733,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,great professor his class easy but you learn a bunch which is the why you pay to go to school right really helpful when you ask him questions in and out of class has a great sense of humor definitely would recommend
10734,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,very nice guy with great intentions can learn a lot if you want to apply yourself otherwise expect a b
10735,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,his class was easy but probably because engr is easy i still know how i did in the class because he never gave us back our project grades very unclear when assigning things to work on and hand back things he graded okay for but i want to take him for any other class
10736,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,i was expecting him to be really bad but to my surprise i had a lot of fun in his class he is always joking around however he does not seem very knowledgeable on the subject matter and his tests were tricky
10737,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,i actually liked vanantwerp this semester despite all of the bad things i heard before what got to know is that is a tough class but that mean the professor is bad i thought he was a funny guy who really made the class fun however his lab helpfulness could be questioned
10738,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,worst prof ever be prepared to learn everything on your own because he teach in class i felt like i was in high school all over again trying to copy his notes from the projector avoid at all costs
10739,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,not too bad corny jokes and dilbert strips liven up class
10740,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,not that bad of a prof a little boring but not too hard
10741,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,just plain boring
10742,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,clear explanations good examples really cares about his students
10743,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,i care what all these people say he may be hard but i liked him funny in a geeky way you just have to work hard get on his good side and your in like flint
10744,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,very poor its no wonder that our school graduates very few chemical engineers why because he teaches the introductory che class
10745,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,he prepare for class assigns problems that the book states are unsolvable not to mention when asking for help on homework he takes off from his office at the time he told you to stop by i learn a thing he really needs to get a clue
10746,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,no comments
10747,Jeremy  Van Antwerp,absolutely awful avoid him he comes unprepared bumbles around in front of class and just reads the notes he displays on the wall over the lcd projector he teach i only go to class to fill in the blanks he leaves in the notes
10748,Emily  Blanck,the worst classes ever this class is the interdisciplinary research and writing course beware its a flipped classroom so whoever you register for is not your professor for the whole weeks blanck is the head of the history department so for some reason shes the only one grading you material loads of work contradictive nit picky
10749,Emily  Blanck,to be fair i am rating blanck on her interdisciplinary research and writing class which is a cotaught class you will get three professors each for weeks focusing on a different subject the class is awful there is so much work with little communication between the professors unfortunately it is mandatory for american studies majors gl
10750,Emily  Blanck,depends on her students way to much if no one responds when she asks the class a question expect a long awkward silence she does however make her lectures clear and is always there for you if you seek help in her class
10751,Emily  Blanck,dr blanck is such a nice lady but an okay teacher really not bad but shes not the best her classes feel long and her lecturing isnt too great at least in y opinion she uses powerpoints a lot but make sure you write down what she says too shes so nice and will help you with anything that you need even outside of class
10752,Emily  Blanck,really nice and gives really good feedback if you ask questions she assigns a considerable amount of homework but manageable but the essays assigned in the course are a little tough so make sure you do them and put effort into it overall good professor
10753,Emily  Blanck,she gives a lot of work she know how to explain things and when you ask her questions she seems like she be bothered
10754,Emily  Blanck,an awesome teacher who depends on her students too much if the students feel like talking the class will drag on very sweet and easy to get along with but the class will drag if you do not participate lots of readings but papers are clear and not too hard
10755,Emily  Blanck,she is a sweet lady but the most boring professor ever good intentions but i would avoid her class at all costs i fell asleep every class i have no idea what the class was even about honestly wish i take her a shame because a nice person but not a very good teacher
10756,Emily  Blanck,very sweet lady her class is a little dry but the subjects you have to learn lots of group no tests just a lot of very passionate about the material and that kind of gets in the way of her teaching but she knows her stuff only teachers for this subject and the other was much harder
10757,Emily  Blanck,had her for historical methods not clear about what she wants from you gives busy work and is completely obsessed with slavery i cant really stand the class but i heard shes the easiest of the historical methods teachers she completely shut down my research topic idea and barely helped me find a new one take someone else if you can
10758,Emily  Blanck,she is a great professor a very sweet person who is very knowledgeable i have taken her twice and have had a good experience in both of her classes work load is fair grading is fair i would recommend her anytime
10759,Emily  Blanck,she to hard have two read two short books for the class and although she tells you to red out of the main textbook i only did three times paper at the end of class based on document with presentation but not to bad so nice but boring and is obsessed with slavery take her if you have a moderate interest in history
10760,Emily  Blanck,i had prof blanck for american studies i was super intimidated when i first started the class we had to buy a number of smaller books rather than one big text the class to my surprise was pretty awesome and she is super helpful if you ever need anything or have any questions she is totally understanding and helpful great class and prof
10761,Emily  Blanck,dr blanck is a nice teacher but her class is difficult there is a lot of work and reading for senior seminar she wants you to learn and cares about her students she will help you in any way possible to assist you in succeeding
10762,Emily  Blanck,prof blanck is a great teacher i learned a lot in her class the work load was not heavy at all pretty much just reading and online discussion she wants you to learn
10763,Emily  Blanck,i took her for intro to american studies she gives a miniquiz every week and you have one pages paper presentation to do its not that bad she is nice although she does keep you till the end of class
10764,Emily  Blanck,pass
10765,Emily  Blanck,a tough teacher but if you do the work you are fine take her if you get bored during lectures because hers tend to drag on
10766,Emily  Blanck,dr blanck is so nice and always willing to answer any anyone ever has you must do the readings each week for daily quizes and a final paper in which you incorporate an outside source not already used in class overall very nice and loves promoting class discussion a few chances for extra credit but overall a good deal of work must be done
10767,Emily  Blanck,intro to american studies isa very easy class only requires readings each week for a quiz and one paper very easy
10768,Philip  Rothschild,dr r is a gem in the em program he is a tough grader and is picky about what he wants but he makes you work for your degree honestly he is not exactly an expert in the field of sport and music management but he will try his best to help you out and find people that can answer your questions he really cares about his students get to know him
10769,Philip  Rothschild,he is so unclear about what he wants he actually told us what he wanted for a project presentation then counted us off when we presented saying he tell us any of those things he has no idea who you are even if you want to think he does he could care less about you he is the only teacher so it made me want to change my major
10770,Philip  Rothschild,he really knows nothing about what he is teaching go back and get an accounting or marketing degree
10771,Philip  Rothschild,a decent enough teacher although you will learn more through the assignments and research than from him and his lectures really tough grader on projects and papers and can be unreasonable my main problem with him is that unless you are interested in venues or planning he really helpful outside of class
10772,Philip  Rothschild,he is a great teacher and you can tell he is very passionate about what he does however for the career profile and seminar he is super super nit picky about what he wants other than that assignment in his class are just busy work
10773,Philip  Rothschild,a lot of work but all worth it creates tons of opportunities to set you up for internships and your future beyond school
10774,Philip  Rothschild,tons of busy work but it pays off who cares what these other people are saying the degree looks damn good on the resume he knows nothing about sports just learn on your own good guy always willing to help
10775,Philip  Rothschild,here is the thing yes he is a hard teacher but if you want to be a manager in an entertainment industry the type and amount of work he makes you do you will probably do times more in the real world unless you want to be a secretary for the rest of your life yes busy work but it prepares you
10776,Philip  Rothschild,these comments are clearly from people who want to put in the work if you really want to major in em and the right place for you you will enjoy dr r and his courses loves what he does and definitely gives a lot of work but it all has a purpose and better for it all
10777,Philip  Rothschild,this man makes you not want to be an em major this class seems to drag on for hours at a time and if it required to be there i would skip a lot material is outdated irrelevant and not useful to the current world this guy is a selfcentered jerk he has his favorites and if you one of them best of luck to you
10778,Philip  Rothschild,i took this guy years ago get out of this major if possible he is an idiot and uses the information that the students from previous years researched does not check for facts and grades solely on presentation not content he will not help you do anything in the entertainment industry that you could not have done without a college education
10779,Philip  Rothschild,as others have stated there are rediculous amounts of work for what you will get out of it it is hard to teach something that you have never been involved in much of the material we went over was not relavent plus outdated em majors must take him so waste your time with a em major both classes were a waste
10780,Philip  Rothschild,you have no choice if you want to be an em major you have to have him as your teacher two times either switch majors or suck it up yeah he gives entirely too much busy work but easy you just have to memorize class work for tests just do what he says be fine
10781,Philip  Rothschild,dr r is an absolutely ridiculous teacher i thought that i was actually going to learn something different by having this major and i you basically get a management degree and take extra classes where you read some articles about music sports event and venue management all the other classes are electives and have nothing to do with e
10782,Philip  Rothschild,if you go to class and do the assigned work you will most likely get an a dr r is absolutely not as bad as everyone else is saying the class is fine he is a nice guy and not hard to do good
10783,Philip  Rothschild,this is probably the most useless class i have had in my school career do not take this class the major is worthless and you will learn nothing about the entertainment business the professor qualified to teach preschool
10784,Philip  Rothschild,all busy work with outdated reading and over loaded teststhere are only two shameless self promotion of his wife and god has yet to respond to any of my emails and his do all the work i considered changing my majorbut this is the general opinion of others involved in this major
10785,Philip  Rothschild,when i drop the class like he asked me to he treated me with sarcastic politeness he is unorganized unreasonable manipulative and basically a jerk he acts like he wants to help the students but he is never genuine his lessons are fine but i will never take another class with him as a teacher
10786,Philip  Rothschild,he will hold a grudge if he disagrees with your views of what is taught in class really did not pertain to the entertainment industry today was not prepared for class and when i went to his office hours for help he brushed me off saying you need to go research this more i had to go to another professor to help me work though the problem
10787,Philip  Rothschild,rothschild will only accept things his way he rarely updates grades on bb however i learned a alot and would take him again
10788,Ligon,a capital markets class that only covers fixed income so the last unit is entirely esoteric derivatives material he is very smart and an excellent teacher but the material is simply too complex for an average finance student memorize the problem sets and pray on the multiple choice you need a textbook he gives you pdf readings
10789,Ligon,this was has been my worst class at alabama during the class lectures dr ligon read verbatim from the powerpoints these powerpoints were directly from the book making them hard to understand he speed reads through every slide to just get it finished in the lecture time he barely went over the math questions and expected you to learn them
10790,Ligon,ligon is just one of those teachers you want to take but have to he have any interest in whether his students really understand or not he speaks above you and looks at you like an idiot if you ask the wrong question spend a few weeks before the exam memorizing the review problems to just get by with a b
10791,Ligon,while he is the very image of the aloof professor he is fantastic guiding students through highly dense materially and demanding as much of himself as his students probably the hardest course i have taken on a daytoday basis but also one of the most rewarding
10792,Ligon,good professor material easy but he lets you know what he requires from you
10793,Ligon,brilliant best teacher at ua
10794,Ligon,i had jl for microstructure.he is an awesome teacher.he presents material in a clear interesting then holds the students responsible for the of the in not easy but one of the best
10795,Ligon,no comments
10796,Ligon,quantitative investment analysis is hell
10797,Ligon,so cool
10798,Marlene  Tromp,she is an absolutely phenomenal professor i really felt like i was taking a stimulating class with someone who is truly passionate in both her field and students in class discussions student ideas and opinions are both valid and encouraged and out of any class i took this is the one that i always wanted to go further with take her classes
10799,Marlene  Tromp,century british literature by far the best professor had at denison she inspires you to think critically with which are extremely but essential in making you think deeply about the topic i have never devoted so much time and thought to a course in my life
10800,Marlene  Tromp,very smart but her classes focus more on discussion than lecture in another subject that might have been helpful but in a brit lit survey class i would have preferred to hear more of what she had to say and less of my opinions
10801,Marlene  Tromp,dr.tromp is a very passionate person her lectures are very involved and she goes out of her way to make you want to do better her enthusiasm both in person and when grading made me nostalgic for high school days i however lost interest in this subject due to the content covered not how she taught it
10802,Marlene  Tromp,love she is definitely the best professor had at denison she is super interested in the material and gets you interested even when the material can be very tedious great class suggest her to any and all students side note i liked her so much i made her my advisor and she teaches the farthest thing from my major
10803,Marlene  Tromp,very popular and never understood why i found her class tedious and her style annoying also quite arrogant
10804,Marlene  Tromp,tromp is one of those professors that i encourage everyone regardless of their major to take before they graduate she forced us to take a seemingly simple subject and wrap our minds around it in a way most students have never considered her classes are fun stimulating and generally unbiased do the work with pride and do fine in class
10805,Marlene  Tromp,incredibly intelligent and engaging fair and very accessible genuinely passionate about the subject matter and truly concerned about her students challenging but very reasonable and willing to help however possible
10806,Marlene  Tromp,i think i took as many classes as i could with dr tromp she taught me how to write and how to think in the most creative and intense way engaging intuitive professor
10807,Marlene  Tromp,no comments
10808,Marlene  Tromp,do your work and you will love her
10809,Marlene  Tromp,professor tromp made me want to talk in class something that no previous professor had ever done learning actually became fun with her
10810,Marlene  Tromp,dr tromp is wonderful she will challenge you but especially if you are thinking of graduate school or honors project take classes with her
10811,Marlene  Tromp,dr tromp is a great professor she is very engaging and is always willing to meet to discuss papers thesis or any problems she is sometimes hard to track down but when you find her she is all answers
10812,Marlene  Tromp,no comments
10813,Marlene  Tromp,one of the most intellectually stimulating professors had she will really make you think about things never thought about before difficult and challenging but you learn a lot of willing to put in the work
10814,Marlene  Tromp,she misleads you she follow through
10815,Rebecca  Comay,she is so lucid gentle and playful one feels as though one were accompanying her on a joyous and novel journey through the ecstatic maze of the phenomenology
10816,Rebecca  Comay,incredible lecturer who demystifies and brings infectious excitement to phenomenology which to newbies is incredibly dense dry and intimidating was frustrated and confused for every reading but in class she made it totally engrossing is very friendly one on one very helpful if u contact her even about doing poorly or missing deadlines
10817,Rebecca  Comay,her class was extremely difficult and dense but if you do the readings and engage with it then a really great teacher her intelligence is intimidating at times but she do it on purpose just actually that smart
10818,Rebecca  Comay,rebecca comay is eloquent and brilliant her instruction in the hegel course got me far beyond my expectation the bitterness towards her coherence must be from some combination of a reluctance to read and a small vocabulary
10819,Rebecca  Comay,i never heard a satisfactory syllogism or argument on any topic outside of her lectures and i still doubt that her phenomenology course would score very highly in the perception class over at psychology i been able to subscribe to this big money course in advanced tautology which is way too abstract for me to handle
10820,Rebecca  Comay,extremely clear yet very challenging she is very captivating if read the material and are determined to understand phenomenology is arguably the most impenetrable text in history so i attribute my little grasp of his philosophy entirely to her instruction
10821,Rebecca  Comay,i only occasionally knew what she wanted to talk about and her syllabus lacked focus she wanted to talk about too many different things with the result that the course lacked coherence her lectures alternate between interesting and terribly boring as she has a tendency to go off on unrelated tangents
10822,Rebecca  Comay,one of the worst professors ever had her run on sentances make it nearly impossible to understand anything she says she speaks like she is attempting to show off her vocabulary to the students she is supposed to be teaching i suggest avoiding any class she teaches
10823,Rebecca  Comay,vocabulary is very rich however that makes trying to understand what she is saying harder because you are focused on her words more than the content the lectures were mostly boring and her constant hitting the mic though annoying startled you awake
10824,Rebecca  Comay,professor comay focuses on nietszche freud and marx only and you understand anything she says her tangents make it very difficult to pay attention lectures are brutal and not falling asleep is a chore good luck
10825,Rebecca  Comay,everyone who thinks this woman is brilliant is horribly mistaken her lectures consist of runon sentences composed of adjectives which are similes of each other this passage is strange mysterious illuding conspiratory if that is what it means to be brilliant then brilliant is the last thing i would ever want to be
10826,Rebecca  Comay,basically as everyone else already said unapproachable indubitably intelligent her not too hard since i eventually did get end up with an a in the class with this extremely difficult material but jeez she told me to fear her
10827,Rebecca  Comay,take a class with her it will blow your mind
10828,Rebecca  Comay,no comments
10829,Rebecca  Comay,completely changed the announced readings first day of class to proust only know names or engage in seminar discussion least approachable prof had seems smart to some but ultimately only repeats herself over and over in more complex sentence structure and flowery vocabulary
10830,Rebecca  Comay,rebecca has a brilliant mind she gives great lectures regardless of what others say i find her very approachable and yes she deserves a chillie pepper
10831,Rebecca  Comay,not for the lazy or uncommitted but incredibly rewarding if you put in the work
10832,Rebecca  Comay,one of the most exciting profs at u of t and not just because so hot which makes me wonder where are all her chili peppers is anyone more deserving
10833,Rebecca  Comay,good god never met such a selfabsorbed professor yes she has ideas but not a teacher she is unapproachable and i wonder what exactly she says to herself each tuesday evening when coming to class because obvious she does not want to be around us or teach us for that matter she repeats too much as if ignorant children
10834,Rebecca  Comay,no comments
10835,Andy  Katz,he made me hate international politics should not be teaching lower level classes
10836,Andy  Katz,andy katz is a great guy and the classes i took with him were some of the best experiences i had at denison very personable and gets you to really engage with material also quite available outside of class and suggest dropping in on office hours just to talk not even about class you regret taking a course with katz

10843,Andy  Katz,katz is one of the best professors ever had incredibly helpful and nice both personally and educationally very very funny and presents material in an interesting way very hard grader
10844,Andy  Katz,he is a teacher that makes class fun interesting challenging intellectualizing stimulate and entertaining at the same time he balances his class between lecture style and class discussion based
10845,Andy  Katz,he is an amazing professor a hard grader but doing well in the class makes you feel good about yourself he is helpful and easy to talk to i highly recommend him as a prof
10846,Andy  Katz,amazing professor honestly one fo the best ever had polisci my major i signed up for the class because i needed a fourth class i went to meet with him before and he was great nice and passionate about teaching as well as the topic itself easy to ask help kept my attention learned more than any other class taken

10852,Andy  Katz,smart funny and engaging
10853,Andy  Katz,the best professor at denison
10854,Andy  Katz,a great teacher but a little too much attention to the ladies in the classroom
10855,Timothy L  Brown,he was an awesome teacher very clear and concise with his instruction he was intolerant of students who pay attention but it was the students fault for not paying attention i would take all of my future classes with him period
10856,Timothy L  Brown,drop the f bomb a lot unprofessional disrespectful immature and yes i am speaking of the teacher got a b in the class but teacher pretty much blows

10863,Timothy L  Brown,a total gives reviews that are completely different from the test if you know math you will not learn it from this teacher belittles students and has a real attitude and temper should be fired yesterday people started and hung on now i get to take col alg again thanks
10864,Timothy L  Brown,the worst professor anyone could ever have his attitude stinks his projects are hard and sometimes he talks about things that are not even in the book if math is not your best subject do not take class with this guy i now know why people hate going back to school
10865,Timothy L  Brown,hahaha give him a break math an easy subject.first you all should admirer him for being second you should spend more time to study rather than sitting here complaining about him a great professor although lb a hottie but definitely a
10866,Timothy L  Brown,if you want a teacher who is polite and respectful to others then professor brown is not the teacher for you take his class if you want a professor who acts too punk rock for the whole world talks to the ladies believes he is god and we are all his servents and is a total geek then take him
10867,Timothy L  Brown,extremely immature
10868,Timothy L  Brown,i got an a in college algebra and when i got to his calculus class i had to drop out because he was so hard and i have always been a good math student he helpful when we make suggestions and if your phone rings he snaps and gives a hard pop quiz
10869,Timothy L  Brown,worst teacher ever treats people like they are stupid when he know anything himself people left out of by the end of the year if you want to work hard and get an f take this rude guy
10870,Timothy L  Brown,not a good teacher at all talks to students as children when he is the same age thinks he is better then the whole wide world still stuck in the nirvana rock scene when that died out ten years ago never take this him for any class worse ever unless you want to fail
10871,Timothy L  Brown,he is the worst teacher ever out there if you want to hear the f k word all the want to take him i was in a class of students and just people survive the attitude of this teacher is the worst ever expect that when taking this class we carefull and good luck
10872,Timothy L  Brown,he talks to fast while your writing down your notes that means that while you are writing the notes from the boared you are missing out what he is explaining that means you can not learn anything i always came out of his class frustrated because i could not get anything what he was saying
10873,Timothy L  Brown,more than half the class withdrew
10874,Timothy L  Brown,could not write any faster very unhelpful poor attitude towards teaching probably wanted to be something else than a teacher childish in his actions and word really bad teacher
10875,Dmitri  Kitsikis,xenophobic selfcentred proud of himself whereas considered by his peers as a martian who is more interested by his glory than the success of his students
10876,Dmitri  Kitsikis,incredibly knowledgeable this man really makes you learn exposed me to a side of the world and another way of life all in one class very helpful outside of courses he even helped me with projects for other classes though no assigned readings and not as much material as i wished gets still reccomend taking his class
10877,Dmitri  Kitsikis,loved him he totally reminded me of the father off of my big fat greek wedding he was a little random at some points but you just had to pay really close attention
10878,Dmitri  Kitsikis,this jury is still out on if his classes are either scatered thoughts of a pure genious or the rantings of an insane man
10879,Dmitri  Kitsikis,knows his stuff but worst prof every had a complete nutter goes off topic all the time about subjects outside of the course and makes wide sweeping comments rants every class about how wrong western society is and what a utopia china was some comments border on insulting thinks the cia is out to destroy china avoid if at all possible
10880,Dmitri  Kitsikis,second only to walker in bad history profs scattered and unclear and his french accent makes it impossible to understand anything also screws up names and dates all the time i leave class more confused then when i go there he seems like a decent guy but nonetheless should be writing books not lecturing
10881,Dmitri  Kitsikis,i loved his classes they were interesting and despite what some people said he really knows his stuff the only complaint i have is that he assign any reading which made catching up with the book a little tough
10882,Dmitri  Kitsikis,well attend the class but sleep the finals is multiple choices and u get the answers before hand
10883,Dmitri  Kitsikis,very unclear lecturer he messes up the dates often and his lack of clarity makes it extremely hard to understand what he is lecturing about i recorded lectures and still had problems figuring out what he was talking about exam was easy he gives you of the final multiple choice quesions at the start of each class
10884,Dmitri  Kitsikis,wow how could you say he knows nothing about chinese history possibly the smartest prof i have ever had he does struggle at keeping his lectures clear but not his problem yours extremely smart and his tests and exam are easy
10885,Dmitri  Kitsikis,can barely speak english know anything about course material gives no page references to decode his impossible lectures he once said and i quote mandarins be lazy like mexicans who sleep under trees all day but not worth the agony and confusion avoid him at all costs
10886,Dmitri  Kitsikis,impossible to understand it gets tough when he starts referring to dates ie he says for both and lectures seem to flow he goes off on tangents every so often but at least the format of the final mult.choice l
10887,Dmitri  Kitsikis,he is crazy absolutely crazy i can understand his french better than his english he is a distinguished prof emeritus but to most of us he was crazy however the course was damn easy the final was just mulitple choice we were given in clas
10888,Dmitri  Kitsikis,this man knows nothing about chinese history his lectures are unclear and cannot field question from students very arrogant and unaccomodating the department should look for a new prof to take over the chinese history courses
10889,Dmitri  Kitsikis,entertaining helpful responds quickly to emails seems to like what doing which is rare i looked forward to going to his class
10890,Dmitri  Kitsikis,no comments
10891,Dmitri  Kitsikis,no comments
10892,Cronin  Justin,a lot of technical help with stories not the vague emotional stuff that you get in many creativewriting courses unlike most rice classes this one is a good place to make friends always fun and it creates a community of serious or semiserious writers
10893,Cronin  Justin,awesome teacher brilliant and fun to have in class
10894,Jerome  Taylor,stop please take any of this classes words to describe his classes boring pointless confusing long boring and annoying he is a nice enough man and even nicer when he is imposing his ideas and beliefs on you during ever class
10895,Jerome  Taylor,he is very hard to listen to until he gets to talking about his own research then easier to stay awake go to his office hours covers the same things in every class but not clear in class on what exactly he wants you to know
10896,Jerome  Taylor,jerome taylor is the worst teacher i have ever had for the following reasons he comes ten minutes late to every class he talks in a incomprehensible monotone voice so its impossible to stay awake in class is extremely disorganized he missed the final forcing us to take an incomplete grade take the final next semester.dont take
10897,Jerome  Taylor,he was an hour late for our final and i had a plane to catch a majority of the class left and had to get an n grade until taking the final once spring semester a lot of the material is on research done himself so no way of getting around having to know everything read the book it do you any good take
10898,Jerome  Taylor,hes a very nice guy but honestly the most boring class ever he talks so quiet and slow you understand anything he says and he writes on the board you wont be able to read any of it his class makes no sense because he just throws things together and no one has any clue what hes doing do not take him as a teacher
10899,Jerome  Taylor,avoid avoid avoid very unorganized and random.late allthe time lucky if he shows up for the final exam talks way too low and slowly lectures do not coincide with the readings grades exams harshly he makes things more difficult than they have to be and only a class
10900,Jerome  Taylor,dr class is very boring do not take the material is quite interesting yet he conveys it in such a confusing way you might study hard but he grades in an odd manner have to memorize statistics out of book talks extremely low so you have to sit close lucky to get an a
10901,Jerome  Taylor,i am currently in hell in this class not only does he look like a st.bernard but he speaks very slowly and quietly and takes lots of pauses in his sentences hard to pay attention you probably be too motivated to go boring and the midterm is the first test of the semester
10902,Jerome  Taylor,this teacher has no grading system you will not receive one single grade in his class and he randomly picks grades out for his students at the end of term if you like to gamble take his class
10903,Jerome  Taylor,i had dr taylor for intro to african american family while the course material was very interesting the professor was not always clear i enjoyed the class because of the course material and dr taylor is a very intelligent man who offers alot of useful information to his students i would only recommend this class to dedicated students
10904,Jerome  Taylor,got an a
10905,Jerome  Taylor,this class may seem easy at first but he makes it so much harder than it has to be he pauses all of the time and never gets to his point be careful and the readings never correspond with class lectures
10906,Jerome  Taylor,i hate him you get like grades per semester so if you up once over
10907,Jerome  Taylor,nice guy smart guy but explain concepts well his class is deceptively difficult because it seems easy at first be ready to pull up pants and put your hard hat on because you will work he is a tough grader and if you got an a in his class like me you truthfully earned it
10908,Jerome  Taylor,the material learned is very interesting but it takes a long time to get to the point has long pauses in the middle of sentences workshops can be funonly if those in the class make it fun the class is needed to debate speak up to make things interesting so get to know your classmates soon
10909,Jerome  Taylor,african american families could have been an interesting class but jerome taylor really isnt a good teacher i do not suggest taking this class dull unclear and just generally frustrating
10910,Jerome  Taylor,very nice but confusing way of teaching talks to low and too many long pauses very roundabout instead of straight to the point and go over what is going to be on the exam just say study everything lets students participate to much that he gets off track and waste class time
10911,Jerome  Taylor,he knows so much and is such a nice guy that it is a shame he cannot relay the information to a class full of eager students he has too much going on outside the classroom studies research etc very meticulous grader
10912,Jerome  Taylor,sex and racism with this professors was the worst class i ever had some people arent meant to teach and jeromoe taylor is one of them
10913,Laurie  Iten,always read the prelab practice quiz questions
10914,Laurie  Iten,i am a genetics major and science is the love of my life this awful teacher left me wondering whether i should even be in the field of science after every class she is horrible sarcastic souleating and her revered lab manual is the stuff nightmares are made of my only recommendation is that if you have to do not take this class
10915,Laurie  Iten,no class will ever be harder than this it is not difficult subject matter at all but the format is bizarre and every point matters the lab manual is full of typos and straight errors the quizzes are over the most obscure parts of the lab manuals come to lab organized study for quizzes and forget loncapa and you will be fine
10916,Laurie  Iten,professor iten managed to make me dread bio lab every single week and she was barely in the room during lab she wrote the lab manual which made simple concepts overlycomplicated and lab procedures convoluted they grade the lab on accuracy rather than effort even though the point of the course is to gain familiarity with lab overall awful
10917,Laurie  Iten,best professor i have ever had if had a chance please take a class with her
10918,Laurie  Iten,dr iten loves to complicate everything she also loves to waste time on clicker questions in order to get done on time read the manual and do all calculations before going to lab understand exactly what be doing in lab to also make it easier look at the sample inlab problems because they are the exact same
10919,Laurie  Iten,read the manual as long as you show up to lab you should be able to earn an a or b on the lab but the quizzes are what will bring your grade down drastically make sure the read the manual carefully before class and go to the biology resource center for any help know how to do any calculations because those are a good chunk of the quizzes
10920,Laurie  Iten,upon meeting dr iten she can seem rather intimidating but you need to go introduce yourself i struggled at the beginning but then realized that if i just start preparing at least a week in advance it is so possible to do well dr iten and the lab manual both put on a scary front but she makes a way bigger deal of it than it really is
10921,Laurie  Iten,this class was not easy it is definitely the weedout course for biology freshman the main key to doing well was starting off strong wait til week to start reading your manual and the blog or looking at the sample inlab quiz questions because it will hurt you you can do well if willing to work for it though
10922,Laurie  Iten,with the right amount of studying and effort you should do well in this class you have to be well prepared for each lab because you work individually and most labs do not leave enough time for one to fix an error overall it was annoying to put so much effort in the class but by the time you finish the class you will know the bio lab well
10923,Laurie  Iten,professor iten wrote the lab manual for her class hence why the labs are extremely confusing the book is full of typos and wrong calculations unfortunately this class is required for biology majors so no way around it
10924,Laurie  Iten,very useful information learned during class
10925,Laurie  Iten,this class is way more difficult than it needs to be the manual is very hard to understand and you get absolutely zero help from the staff
10926,Laurie  Iten,dr iten the best professor around you only see her at the beginning of class when she wastes the lab time you have answering questions with clickers the lab manuel is kind of hard to understand and there are many spelling and grammatical errors in it
10927,Laurie  Iten,this lab course is way more difficult than it needs to be she makes herself so unapproachable but be intimidated because the only way to do well is to ask a ton of questions whether you contact her or your tas
10928,Laurie  Iten,there is barely any interaction with prof iten the class is completely handled by the tas do the pre labs fully read and understand the lab manual and go over the practice quizzes and be fine not as bad as some people on here are saying it is
10929,Laurie  Iten,prof was only present at the beginning of class and did virtually nothing to help us understand the material the textbook which can only be bought from her and has no resale value literally contradicted itself and made understanding simple things impossible in addition it was ripe with simple spelling mistakes overall it was a bad class
10930,Laurie  Iten,this is really a difficult class but if you can keep up each time you will get at least b in biol keeping touch with your tas are extremely important
10931,Laurie  Iten,she was never actually in the class the tas were good about helping but i had zero contact with prof iten all semester
10932,Laurie  Iten,she is rude and unwilling to offer any excuse being an international student i was totally lost in her class she is a strict lady which is nice but i dont think anyone feels comfortable in her class please avoid her class at all costs
10933,Paul  Frishkoff,mean man the worst at u.o changed my major at uo
10934,Paul  Frishkoff,frishkoff is one of the biggest met in my entirety seriously make the class fun interesting or anything worth coming to the worst teacher at the university of oregon
10935,Paul  Frishkoff,no comments
10936,Paul  Frishkoff,simply one of the most amazing classes and teachers i have ever encountered he may be a bit bitter slight charming but the guy knows his stuff and will shake up your world a bit be suprised to see the class party together cry smile and laugh.it completely changed my major and my life
10937,Paul  Frishkoff,mean spirited old man he should be an accountant
10938,Paul  Frishkoff,this was a very difficult class to take as a freshman although he was harsh to deal with i needed a slap of reality while transitioning schools settings i felt a sense of accomplishment when i was done he really is a nice man when not teaching
10939,Paul  Frishkoff,horribly mean teacher who only criticized his students even remember who the twenty people in his class were made us where name tags and had harder course material in a freshman seminar than upper level classes
10940,Dan  McCarthy,terrible professor his lecture slides are random quotes pasted from a journal abstract and to learn anything you need to read all the journals is it laziness probably if you like reading journals per lecture leaving more confused after asking him a question or being stood up at his office hours take a course with mccarthy
10941,Dan  McCarthy,this man should not be a professor he is a kind man but this man does not teach or provide material to learn from he is a horrendous professor and should not be employed as a professional teacher i have learned absolutely nothing from him and im so angry i spent my money on his class of toenails could teach me more than he ever has
10942,Dan  McCarthy,absolutely amazing professor a wonderful person as well labs are very easy marks and his exams are extremely fair
10943,Dan  McCarthy,dan is a really polarizing character if you participate in class and ask intelligent questions he is very willing to help you succeed his lecture style is really quite strange but i really enjoyed his classes
10944,Dan  McCarthy,professor dan is amazing i understand sometimes he can seem as though he goinf off into a completley different topic but in the end it all relates he is helpful passionate kind and caring when it comes to the subject at hand and his students he one of the best profs at brock i throughly enjoyed his teaching style and him as a professor
10945,Dan  McCarthy,my least favourite prof ever i am an earth science major and luckily i have choice in classes and will never take another class with him he is very smart but does not know how to teach you have to go to class since lecture notes online are not helpful and for a textbook it was a bunch of different books on reserve
10946,Dan  McCarthy,this is by far the worst prof i have ever had he is smart but doesnt know a thing about how to teach lies what he says is on a test is not it not helpful in any way when it comes to asking questions in regards to essay or even on the subject as a whole he just makes it more confusing
10947,Dan  McCarthy,prof mccarthy is a nice guy but very scatterbrained and disorganized he is interested in his field and sure quite knowledgeable but often goes off on tangents and tie it all together could have skipped several classes and still got the same info overall decent though
10948,Dan  McCarthy,i took several of his classes and i wish i had found this site found him to be extremely scatterbrained there were several times i had to go talk to him about an essay topic and he kept changing my topic and adding things until even i was confused he would then get upset with me for the changes he made he blames students for his faults
10949,Dan  McCarthy,horrible prof horrible person
10950,Dan  McCarthy,dishonourable treatment of students there should be punitive measures for his behaviour
10951,Dan  McCarthy,decent enough for undergrad courses but an absolute nightmare for graduate work will constantly blame you for stuff he demanded in his revisions very unorganized have much knowledge on the graduate thesis process i have sincerely regretted choosing him as my advisor he will try to keep you there as long as possible for funding
10952,Dan  McCarthy,the best earth science teacher at brock he really challenges you to think a lot of readings in his courses but you come out having learned a great deal
10953,Dan  McCarthy,very monotone however as others have said he is incredibly helpful and labs are really easy marks
10954,Dan  McCarthy,although he is monotone and tends to speak in questions his labs are free marks and if you pay attention to his lectures and his exam hints to fine very helpful if you understand something
10955,Dan  McCarthy,i knew him when he was still in geography back then his labs were the booster for my gpa rock on
10956,Dan  McCarthy,great prof always available to answer questions and responds to emails usually in the same day even on his exams and labs are a little tough because he expects us to remember more than he teaches us
10957,Dan  McCarthy,boring be more monotone so not funny
10958,Dan  McCarthy,spaced out guy
10959,Dan  McCarthy,no comments
10960,Andrew  Irvine,great prof very down to earth and reasonable one of the best profs in the department
10961,Andrew  Irvine,irvine made the course much more enjoyable than the topic alone content was fairly interesting but not riveting most fair and clear exams and grading criteria experienced so far incredibly helpful and approachable in office hours you need to study to do well but you get the grade you earn which i love irvine is fantastic
10962,Andrew  Irvine,be sure to see him in his office hours if you want to do well fortunately he seemed to have more office hours then the rest of my professors combined papers take about hours to write and about the same amount of time to edit
10963,Andrew  Irvine,essays midterm and final nice guy and goes over material well but marks papers and midterm based more on grammar and writing style than actual content very high expectations for a first year class
10964,Andrew  Irvine,probably the nicest kindest professor out there simply a genuine guy extremely helpful and approachable for advice decisions or help in the course his lectures are great to attend they are all you need to succeed highly recommend him as a professor he really promotes discussions and debate great teacher and got me interested in philosophy
10965,Andrew  Irvine,such a kind caring through professor attend lectures those are all the notes you need to do well encourages discussion individual thought and expression and is hands down the cutest prof ever
10966,Andrew  Irvine,an awesome prof super clear had an exam with him yet but incredibly approachable and supportive encourages students to engage in thoughtful discussion and incredibly positive highly recommended
10967,Andrew  Irvine,a casual and helpful professor my complaint is that he stuck too closely to the readings in lecture i wish he would have stimulated more discussion and brought in material i thought the course was really easy and the lectures often ended early maybe just me but i felt like the class kind of turned me off moral philosophy
10968,Andrew  Irvine,he does seem nice but i think phil is a gpa booster perhaps i am not suitable for this kind of the materials were dry and boring however if you like logic you might want to take it but in my opinion i recommend
10969,Andrew  Irvine,dr irvine is honestly one of the kindest people ever met his lectures are very interesting and easy to understand tests are really fair
10970,Andrew  Irvine,this guy was made to teach i still find the subject material boring so his lectures always special but always crystal clear great format and consistency between text book questions lectures and tests highly recommended
10971,Andrew  Irvine,the man
10972,Andrew  Irvine,awesome prof irvine is a very nice caring and passionate prof he is very interesting to listen to if you ever go to his office hours such a nice guy he is very patient and makes sure you leave his room happy and confident in the material highly recommend taking this course for gpa boosters and having him as a prof
10973,Andrew  Irvine,you need to attend his lectures but if you have time you should check it out but if you read from the book and you should be fine the subject was easy and the quizzes were fair the average for our class was so if planning on getting some ez credits definitely recommend him
10974,Andrew  Irvine,very good at getting his message across in class manages to make a relatively boring topic semiinteresting you really need to go to class though everything is in the textbook going to class does help to clarify
10975,Andrew  Irvine,an easy a
10976,Andrew  Irvine,an intellectual and effective teacher he is very clear in his teaching and he can provide concrete examples while he is at it very approachable too the reading list for this class is massive though still he is a fair marker when it the ta who was marking
10977,Andrew  Irvine,an excellent prof can take complex concepts and teach them with clarity insight and without the academic technobabble or highbrowed esoteric philosophizing good sense of humor answers questions thoughtfully knows his stuff and is straightforward inspires interest in the subject highly recommend
10978,Andrew  Irvine,he is a brilliant teacher makes the class really interesting the tests seemed easy because he tried really hard to make sure everyone was prepared and fully understood the material
10979,Andrew  Irvine,brilliant prof always explained everything so well entertaining interactive thoughtfully answered questions reading too brutal midterm was fairly easy great class
10980,Michael  Besney,course itself is pretty difficult but lectures are the best thing to listen to he is loud and speaks his mind during class so as long as you can get pass that a amazing instructor to have
10981,Michael  Besney,he can be aggressive and loud in his lectures but he just wants to get his point across he is absolutely flawless at explaining things and is very funny and friendly i would recommend taking his class for sure absolutely worth it
10982,Michael  Besney,not my teaching style tends to be aggressive and loud using phrases in lectures like i know how anyone know this if you know this by now i know what to do seem fully prepared for later course material high energy and enthusiastic friendly often jokes around
10983,Michael  Besney,mike is a great teacher to have for intro to programming i had zero programming experience going into the class but his teaching made it easier for me when he is explaining topics and theory he really makes sure what he is saying is clear the class is known for being hard which is why easiness is but if you go to class and work do ok
10984,Michael  Besney,i had no previous programming knowledge before this class and i walked with a b his lectures are funny and interesting he dumbs it down so you can understand the concepts go to the sl sessions free tutoring and anything free is good they help clarify the lectures and are hands on mike wants you to pass so you have support there
10985,Michael  Besney,mike does not care about his students the only way you will do good in this class is if you work your ass off or have previous coding experience this class is very stressful and you have to put in like hours a week just on homework if you understand they do offer sl student learning sessions but they all that helpful
10986,Michael  Besney,good class as long as you show up and pay attention pass if struggling just attend sl sessions and its almost impossible to fail
10987,Michael  Besney,best
10988,Michael  Besney,very funny personality talks like he care but as he more excited he sounds more angry which makes learning programming really funny if you are new to programming take his class if you already know how to program take his class because if you finish the assignments you get guaranteed rest is the tests
10989,Michael  Besney,great instructor can be intimidating at first but he just gets really excited about programming really helpful for new programmer at explaining concepts in plain english
10990,Michael  Besney,mike is a total boss best instructor had at nait
10991,Michael  Besney,amazing programming instructor able to relate programming concepts in a way that is easy for newer programmers to understand overall a very friendly guy he should quit smoking though
10992,Michael  Besney,i am a garbage programmer but this guy is a very good instructor if you have the ability to learn programming easy going helpful will do half the code for you if you are struggling probably the best introductory programming instructor you could get show some effort and he will always help you
10993,Michael  Besney,amazing amazing amazing definately one of the best teachers i have ever had great guy
10994,Michael  Besney,awesome professor lots of energy teaches with repetition but in a good way song roll up your totals and other lame but cute things work beautifully as mnemonic devices really cares about student success as long as the student cares themself
10995,Michael  Besney,this guy is soo funny always making us laugh very helpful when you need his help too if i had one word to describe him quirky
10996,Michael  Besney,first day i was in class with mike he had soo much energy i felt like i was in the mean just excited after that day he calmed down though mike is a very enthuastic instructor who loves what he does and helps his students a in preparing for labs and exams just keep him away from sugar i enjoyed his class
10997,Michael  Besney,one of the best teachers come across in cst so far mike gives superb inclass examples that are relevant to the lab assignments take time to help out students including running over code from several students in his office over his breaks
10998,Michael  Besney,one of the best instructors had very helpful in all areas will do anything he can to help a student understand and pass the courses he teaches
10999,Michael  Besney,promoting student success yes
11000,Nora Jean  Paradis,not very clear always had something bad to say about accountants and lawyers never had an assignment graded by her as she leftwas removed halfway through the semester
11001,Nora Jean  Paradis,condescending rude talks over students when she asks questions unclear confusing chaotic like watching a one person tennis match who is playing both sides
11002,Nora Jean  Paradis,very easy to follow and sets assignment dates at a reasonable pace a little bit too much handholding although based on some other reviews i can see why she might
11003,Nora Jean  Paradis,horrible instructor picks favourites vague instructions and at times unrealistic deadlines when roughly of the class is failing keep in mind we started with some people and fell to doing something wrong please go away forever
11004,Nora Jean  Paradis,she needs to leave this department she has such a low level interest with all students she makes references to classes she does not communicate with the other professor her basic skill knowledge of computers is limited cant stand her as a teacher
11005,Nora Jean  Paradis,completely agree with one of the previous ratings she acts like she is friendly but she is actually not she choose people to be nice to
11006,Nora Jean  Paradis,she was really helpful over email most instructors are horrible at that so props to her for that
11007,Nora Jean  Paradis,i just dont like her she acts like she is friendly but she is actually not she choose people to be nice to
11008,Nora Jean  Paradis,she was very helpful and lenient when my group was getting our project done
11009,Nora Jean  Paradis,she spent far too much time writing code on the board julie lutter uses that same technique it is to far out of date to be used at nait never really knew what i was supposed to do was lost by the time lab1 was out even though i got on quiz
11010,Nora Jean  Paradis,her classes were agonizing almost never did her code work and spend the rest of class helping one student try to get her code fixed aweful
11011,Shane  Bell,due to issues i was only able to show up to class once a week for our exams every friday and yet i managed to pass with a class was not difficult but it was a hassle to receive our grades and marks and even now that the semester is over i still do not have a final
11012,Shane  Bell,a hilarious teacher he always wanted to take the time to help out students do the best they could if you try in this class its an easy a
11013,Shane  Bell,shane is a great teacher he always makes sure everyone understands and is totally willing to help with problems even if it means looking into it after hours for a student his lessons are clear and leave you prepared to complete the labs and in class assessments
11014,Shane  Bell,great instructor sadly not enough variety on exercises lab and quiz questions half the time are not near what you were taught lectures are great and he is available to answer any questions but his grading system is way too strict and he will deduct marks for the most minor error that has no effect on the code itself expect less mark
11015,Shane  Bell,shane bell was surprisingly cool he cared about the class and his students and he always wanted everyone to succeed his classes were fun and engaging and he did a lot of inclass activities that got everybody involved with the course material if there was ever a problem shane was always willing to help in any way he could very awesome
11016,Shane  Bell,shane is a stand up guy if you show up to class and engage you fail he always gives class time for labs and allows a cheat sheet for tests put in some effort and you should have no problem getting a good mark
11017,Shane  Bell,shane is hilarious and really good at explaining concepts you need to practice your code and show up to every lecture his tests were really challenging compared to the labs more than willing to help you if you need it there are sl sessions you can attend with a student tutor which are free will supply duotangs for labs thanks shane
11018,Shane  Bell,shane this guy is the best one of the funniest teachers had this class is known for a high fail rate but shane is very helpful and wants you to pass if you do not show up to class or do the exercises you might fail the content is not super easy but manageable if you put in the effort hell of a guy tough course go to class kids
11019,Shane  Bell,he is an incredible instructor for database fundamentals funny gives good analogies and is extremely quickwitted you could ask him anything related to databases and he would give you a wellthought out answer on the spot whenever a student had a question he mind taking the time to explain things over would highly recommend
11020,Shane  Bell,dmit1508 has a very high fail rate shane makes this class awesome and fun as long as you show up and pay attention you can do very well i suspect the high fail rate is due to people browsing their facebook or text messages in class paying for the course waste your chances
11021,Shane  Bell,this class overall has an incredibly high fail rate this teacher however make it any easier his lectures are confusing and give any chances for a retake or even to earn lost marks if you fail one quiz or one lab just drop the course and waste your time you need a on every piece of assignment to pass
11022,Shane  Bell,seems totally disorganized not helpful in any way really know what talking about i was totally dissatisfied do not reccommend
11023,Shane  Bell,he started out motivated and interesting but after midterms barely taught at all leaving the majority of time for lab time uh inclass wow im and facebook anyone and general skipping his notes are a dump of information which he mined for obscure things not over in class for midterm and finals
11024,Shane  Bell,he was a good guy i liked his structured approach to the course and got the stuff done he was helpful and liked to help you if you really needed it which was greatly appreciated
11025,Shane  Bell,at the beginning of the course he was a super nice guy funny then something rotten must have happened in his personal life cos half way through he became a miserable old coot
11026,Shane  Bell,after reading the comments say getting better at teaching probably only his or year teaching a good teacher but i miss a single class cause ignore you if you skip
11027,Shane  Bell,no comments
11028,Shane  Bell,typical instructor really do anything to stand out being able to right quiz ist on the computers made it alot easier to get
11029,Shane  Bell,spent most of class scratching his head erasing and rewriting his code and trying to remember syntax his classes were a waste of time he never prepared or updated himself
11030,Dwayne  Rurka,incredibly rude and unprofessional likes to demean students and embarrass them in front of the class
11031,Dwayne  Rurka,dwayne was a funny teacher that was very helpful in bringing realism and humor to the project management course be warned overly sensitive students may not enjoy him he was available to give you constructive criticism on your assignments and related any issues he found with them to real life examples
11032,Dwayne  Rurka,he is one of the amazing teachers at nait he has a great level of sarcasm his teaching method is different which make everything so easy to understand he relates things to daily life and gives different example which makes it so easy to understand
11033,Dwayne  Rurka,honestly i thought dwayne rurka was the best professor i have even encountered at n.a.i.t the lectures were interesting he made sure the students were included in the arguments and he kept us on out toes i really took in what he taught from his classes and have new respect for other perspectives so i want to say thank you
11034,Dwayne  Rurka,sure he might be a bit rough but he explains the ins and outs of design from sequence diagrams use cases to screen designs able to point the flaws and mistakes when you submit a document
11035,Dwayne  Rurka,truthfully i took classes in dmit expecting to receive a scholarly perspective i dont think he even has a degree as a group we learned the same as watching a youtube video presented by a yr old
11036,Dwayne  Rurka,he was nothing but a bully disguised as a teacher yelling and taunting kids were his main teaching methods if you can switch out of his class
11037,Dwayne  Rurka,a big heart under his rough exterior made what should have been a boring class entertaining and worthwhile he does like to pick on students but it is all in good fun and he rewards students that pout in effort let his gruff hunter persona fool you either he is one of the most intelligent people in the faculty
11038,Dwayne  Rurka,from what should be the most boring class sad doing flow charts and drawings dwayne actually manages to keep things interesting he likes to joke around and pick on people but all in good fun although he can be tough on you in class at times his class is definitely my favorite
11039,Dwayne  Rurka,dwayne can be a total jerk and i found him to be unreliable and disinterested in actually helping students he tries to be intimidating but just laughable his giant ego live up to his imagined greatness
11040,Dwayne  Rurka,dwayne is an awesome project instructor he takes care of the the project team in order to ensure that both the client and the needs are met without being intrusive he allows pms to take the lead in managing the project but is always available for support you should be so lucky to attend his class
11041,Dwayne  Rurka,like the previous person said u never know what mood dwayne maybe in but he was still a very well knowledgable prof
11042,Dwayne  Rurka,he has a unique attitude you never know how react to a situation but more often than not it be to your liking
11043,Jeffrey  Salloway,excellent teacher and a fine human being highly reccomended
11044,Jeffrey  Salloway,totally nuts but an amazing teacher had him for classes and want to take another with him
11045,Jeffrey  Salloway,such an amazing teacher if i could take that class again i would in a heart beat
11046,Jeffrey  Salloway,this guy is odd kinda mean sometimes when you see things his way like how he interacts with female students weird acts nice like your good buddy and then can zap you out of nowhere material is interesting but he can be off the wall be careful of him is my best advice
11047,Jeffrey  Salloway,i thought taking a hour long class would be difficult to get through each week but salloway is so interesting and intriguing and always looking to make jokes he is very smart in general and has a deep passion for what he teaches but he is very judgmental of his students and a strange grader with unclear parameters
11048,Jeffrey  Salloway,this man loves what he does sometimes a little too much class lectures include personal stories which are sometimes refreshing but most of the time have nothing to do with the class topic on the exam he actually wrote you will not know all of the answers on this exam then why ask the questions
11049,Jeffrey  Salloway,funny guy picks favorites wierd grading style and lecturer
11050,Jeffrey  Salloway,his teaching style is the best seen in a while he is engaging and forces his students to think for themselves and actually learn the material
11051,Jeffrey  Salloway,salloway is a great story teller and i did very well in his class if you do very well he will try and push you into the major he will be persistant too persistant anyways hopefully you have kvd as your lab instructor because she is hot and put out to me during the semester fun
11052,Jeffrey  Salloway,excellent teacher makes epidemiology a really fun class
11053,Jeffrey  Salloway,best teacher i had in all years
11054,Jeffrey  Salloway,hes a good guy grading isnt entirely based on your he really encourages classroom interaction so take advantage of participation points i also took with him and it was very interesting but kinda gross
11055,Jeffrey  Salloway,wicked nice guy his grading was pretty lenient and shows he cares about his students by taking time after class to talk with students and their concerns however keep up with the reading because if you fall behind youre screwed
11056,Jeffrey  Salloway,took this class as a gen ed and found it facinating salloway is an entertaining lecturer and a very interesting guy but he does dedmand hard work
11057,Jeffrey  Salloway,he used to be such a great guy i looked forward to class with him but lately just grouchy and mean and sometimes hurtful no need to crush unsuspecting former students emotions be your best friend until you do something he thinks is beneath you then make you feel like a loser
11058,Jeffrey  Salloway,salloway really wants everyone to learn the material very scatterbrained in terms of teaching style and thus sometimes hard to follow but a wonderfully jolly and kind man he looks like santa he really knows his stuff and tries to make class worthwhile for students his tests easy but he grades fairly and scales a really great class
11059,Jeffrey  Salloway,dr salloway needs to retire asap he may have been great in the past but starting to slip he is always angry which seems to influence his he needs to take care of his issues before he comes in to class he tries to be funny and gets a few nervous chuckles but otherwise is not well liked at least this semester
11060,Jeffrey  Salloway,what a i made an appointment to go in and discuss a paper topic and he blew me when i called him i had to leave voicemail messages because never around a total technophobe he also blamed the missed appointment on me saying he had written down the next week i programmed it into my calenda
11061,Jeffrey  Salloway,totally awesome right about his lectures they get off topic easily so you have to take whatever you want from his teachings
11062,Jeffrey  Salloway,best professor i have had at unh interesting entertaining and always willing to help
11063,S.  Geller,words explain her greatness my classmates and i all agreed that this was one of the best courses at york dr geller is extremely respectful helpful and professional not the kind of professor who enjoys torturing you you will have no problem doing the papers and presentations as long as you do your work i really enjoyed the class
11064,S.  Geller,she is totally awesome she might not have the time to meet up so if a student who likes to meet up with her after class to dicuss things she probably appeal to you what i loved about prof geller is that she provided a on approach to learning very knowledgleable fair engaging i always looked forward to her class
11065,S.  Geller,great prof she is a great lecturer involves the class and has lots of interesting movies the tests are easy if you do the reading directly out of the text book for the multiple choice and lecture notes for short answer her lecture notes are available in the library very good prof
11066,S.  Geller,a great teacher one of the best i have ever had very clear has great examples and attemps to make the class involved in the lectures
11067,S.  Geller,she is very knowledgable in what she does i give her that she may be an amazing therapist but as an instuctor she is quite bad not flexible even re meeting unclear about assignments lectures too fast with too much stuff on overhead she teaches only parttime mainly a therapist
11068,S.  Geller,dr geller was so organized all mc questions were from text and short answers from lectures you know what to expect and can study accordingly know your stuff and do well i got an a in her class i actually looked forward to attending
11069,S.  Geller,good prof
11070,Angela  O\'Mahony,a really smart prof and willing to help out but the notes she provides are worse than bad and not much to add during lectures the readings were interesting but it was hard to apply them to the paper and final i wish she relied more on her own teaching than on outside literature leaves much to be desired
11071,Angela  O\'Mahony,great prof very personable teaching style and a knack for breaking down complex ideas expectations were clear and she was very approachable for clarifications also great at answering questions
11072,Angela  O\'Mahony,a good professor very engaging her teaching style helps keep students interested the course could have been organized better
11073,Angela  O\'Mahony,enthusiastic intelligent and interesting professor teaches very well and is a good marker she is always willing to help and she is wellread in her field recommended
11074,Angela  O\'Mahony,awesome she is very enthusiastic about the topic extremely knowledgeable and her class made me much more interested in the subject she makes a real effort to make assignments interesting and nonrepetitive she is also super approachable and willing to help students out i highly recommend taking a seminar course from her
11075,Angela  O\'Mahony,well organized course good lecturer shows interest in topic easy papers
11076,Angela  O\'Mahony,make you work but she marks fair and communicates clearly in her lectures you do well if you slack off but if you are interested in the topic definitely learn
11077,Angela  O\'Mahony,take econ before you take this class but really not that hard even if you great as a person very fun do the readings a bit much the is useless wild swing in marking
11078,Angela  O\'Mahony,its a good thing helpful outside of class because i guarantee be going to her office hours for help after sat through her dry and discombobulated lectures
11079,Angela  O\'Mahony,very fun but talks too fast more organized this term the econ is the course is okay marks things really fast returns you the essays the next class a fair marker
11080,Angela  O\'Mahony,very nice person and she is very helpful and approachable as well as being very knowledgable about the class think she marks a little on the hard side and her lectures are sometimes disorganized.do not take this class unless you have taken econ
11081,Angela  O\'Mahony,fair but challenging marker not an easy course but she is very knowledgeable and helpful when you need it difficult to take notes off however needs a powerpoint presentation or something
11082,Angela  O\'Mahony,please take this unless you really have to she goes way too fast to understand new concepts and assumes you know a lot of economic shortcuts very unorganized lectures
11083,Angela  O\'Mahony,laid back easygoing and she definitley knows her stuff just wish she knew how to teach and give lectures
11084,Angela  O\'Mahony,although she is very nice and approachable she mumbles not talks very fast and gets off topic easily no overhead notes or powerpoint presentations which make lectures unclear and difficult to
11085,Doug  MacIntyre,the only thing difficult with his classes is the volume of information needed to have an understanding of doug is eager to help any student though if confused at all ask for help
11086,Doug  MacIntyre,he tells the same stories over and over again he reads right from the textbook and points at the board with a lazer pointer he can barely walk and makes his tests hard he expects to fail worst prof ever
11087,Doug  MacIntyre,tests and bell ringers are very hard you really need to study his lectures are interesting to say the least his sex lecture if by far the lecture ever been to in my years at bu
11088,Doug  MacIntyre,doug macintyre is brilliant he is extremely intelligent and very helpful you just have to know that if you need assistance you have to ask and he will do whatever he can to help go to class although it is mostly straight from the text his little random pieces of info are interesting and helpful for remembering other processes
11089,Doug  MacIntyre,definetly knows his stuff go to class even though the same info is in the text midterms and final are hard study your butt off many people take the class many times will help you if you need help he makes the class interesting with his little stories
11090,Doug  MacIntyre,get a second opinion if you see him for course advice i know lots of students who had to come back for another year because he told them the wrong stuff good at teaching a p though
11091,Doug  MacIntyre,great guy expects a lot but works hard himself knows his stuff well i recommend
11092,Doug  MacIntyre,doug is a great prof go to the lectures to hear his that will never appear in any textbook
11093,Doug  MacIntyre,no comments
11094,Doug  MacIntyre,no comments
11095,Doug  MacIntyre,read the textbood and bother going to class
11096,Doug  MacIntyre,no comments
11097,Doug  MacIntyre,very nice lectures well
11098,Doug  MacIntyre,too smart to teach altough he is a very nice guy
11099,Andrzej  Czajkowski,lectures well structured so a lot of self learning in this course exam questions come from assignments the textbook and a test bank his use of mcqs can be good and bad good because you can guess bad because you get part marks difficult to do well in this course but also difficult to fail
11100,Andrzej  Czajkowski,his exams are fair half multiple choice and half long answer and he gives partial credit even if you mess up i do a whole lot of work and i still almost got a b so try and an easy course
11101,Andrzej  Czajkowski,ok prof he likes to talk about concepts instead of solving lots of problems in class which helps with understanding but all the tests are only on the questions you have to attend dgds for that but all past tests can be found online with answers and he seems to reuse the same questions every year so its not too hard to do well on his exams
11102,Andrzej  Czajkowski,overall a good professor with all the bonus marks and gift marks he makes it pretty hard to fail his class he does extra review sessions before midterms and the final exam and really useful to attend them a great lecturer but be prepared to do a great amount of work in his class or you get a good grade
11103,Andrzej  Czajkowski,probably the funniest prof i had last semester he is a fair guy and gives you lots of opportunities to do well in the course he tosses free bonus marks go to there are quizzes that can result in bonus marks for or he provides you with all of his course notes which has everything you need for the course find old exams
11104,Andrzej  Czajkowski,very fair at marking and is really really funny his classes were the highlight of my semester wait for phy
11105,Andrzej  Czajkowski,how can you hate him lots of extra bonus points and he recycles his questions he really tries his best to keep the class entertained i believe he wants the best for his students but his teaching technique isnt really the best make sure you try to understand the content before class and his teaching supplements whatever youve got go for dgds
11106,Andrzej  Czajkowski,hilarious guy however i found i was doing lots of selflearning he is not the best at explaining concepts and some parts felt a little rushed like rotational dynamics however he is so generous with marks he gives tons of extra credit and the questions he asks on assignments and tests are very fair if you did well in grade physics ur good
11107,Andrzej  Czajkowski,prof czajkowski is the only prof for this course and is the best he can be intimidating but he is hilarious his marking is really fair such that you will not be able to fail his class unless you put in no work the final was multiple choice which was good midterms were quite hard but he gives many opportunities to bring your mark up
11108,Andrzej  Czajkowski,he gets angry at students from time to time and i remember ever being on schedule in his class he skips over some content in class sometimes would ask tas to make up for it in dgds the assignments are hard but if you can do them good for the midterms exam was more challenging in addition to being entirely multiple choice
11109,Andrzej  Czajkowski,great prof while the content is hard he is a funny lecturer and makes it really difficult to fail take the class as an elective but czajkowski makes it easy to enjoy hilarious emails too
11110,Andrzej  Czajkowski,sends the most hilarious emails if you get his sarcasm you will hate him accent is thick but still easy to understand attending the lectures is a must content posted online doing an assignment every week is annoying but easily brings up your grade midterms and exams were fair to what we saw in class posts old tests and breakdown
11111,Andrzej  Czajkowski,not the best teacher he goes over a lot of the assignments in class and makes it very difficult to fail i failed a midterm and the final and still managed to pass with over a also do the extra credit it can take pretty close to off the final exam very difficult class if you take high school physics go to class worth it
11112,Andrzej  Czajkowski,reviewers say czajkowski is rude but because no one understand sarcasm these days i found him to be very outside of lectures office hours where you can talk to him on many complain about how heavy the course is but assignments are optional bonus points kids are also salty since they take hs physics
11113,Andrzej  Czajkowski,there are assignments every week which although is a lot only of possible points actually counts which leaves out assignments you only lose bonus marks from him if you ask questions from a lecture weeks ago there are many practice quizzes at the dgds to help you a great prof and wants to help but a difficult course
11114,Andrzej  Czajkowski,he has a huge ego he likes to single out students in class and embarrass them for answering questions wrong and thinks he is a lot better of a teacher than he actually is he also takes away marks if you ever email him or go to his office hours he really like to help students gives lots of homework and just rude in general
11115,Andrzej  Czajkowski,this class will take over your life the prof is extremely egotistical and thinks he is the best thing since sliced bread he no written feedback until the if this course is a requirement for you recommend trying to get another prof or get well acquainted with khan academy and be prepared to self teach
11116,Andrzej  Czajkowski,just a jerk he expects you to pick up the material immediately and is shocked if you get it like he does says some funny things in class but about it otherwise a hard professor not looking to help you
11117,Andrzej  Czajkowski,he is rude when you talk to him he turns your back towards you and starts talking to somebody else on the final exam he changed the order of the questions but forgot to change the order of the answers in addition the scanner missed some answers we were shocked when we received the results but he would not believe us that something went wrong
11118,Andrzej  Czajkowski,favourite first year prof genuinely cares about students with prelecture quizzes assignments etc he gives you more than enough of a chance to bump up your grade his are very reasonable do the assignments and go to class oftentimes midterm questions will be taken straight from assignments and inclass questions
11119,Greg  Osland,osland is a very nice man his intro marketing class however is tough the lectures are fun but his grades are not posted on moodle also he grades very subjectively by always requiring essays on exams vs multiple choice study very hard for this class
11120,Greg  Osland,very dull course tests are difficult and the class is a bore to sit through am not a fan of him or his teaching methods
11121,Greg  Osland,attempting to stay conscious in this class takes skills beyond the average human one of the most boring professors ever had lectures the entire class period and takes no effort to engage his students especially in a subject like marketing this is pure torture takes random points off on exams and bores you to death do not take
11122,Greg  Osland,dr osland is a fantastic guy and an intelligent professor nice as could be and i really enjoyed his lectures most of them were interactive with the class so that helped to keep things interesting but he was somewhat weird when it came to grading basically on all assignments and tests he took off a couple points and i totally sure why
11123,Greg  Osland,hard grader on tests and really give reasons for grades most of the time especially on tests other than that he is a solid teacher and would recommend him if you are trying to play it safe
11124,Greg  Osland,lectures were fairly interesting but the were no where near captivating dr osland was intelligent but his arrogance made class a chore also tell him if you speak spanish you will end up having to listen to him butcher the language to you each class
11125,Greg  Osland,he really engages his students and i absolutely loved his ghs i expecting to enjoy it but he did an awesome job
11126,Greg  Osland,great professor he explains everything clearly and provides study guides for the tests he grades fairly and plans his assignments so students can keep up with the workload i hope i will have the opportunity to be in one of his mba classes
11127,Greg  Osland,he never gives real homework assignments your grades are based solely on a few papers and the tests you write he is very vague about what is going to be on the test and reviewing just confused me more nice guy but needs to clarify what we exactly need to know succeed in the class
11128,Greg  Osland,he is excellent he knows his stuff makes it interesting shows ads and example throughout the semester to make it interactive allinall he is great professor and i hope i get to take him again
11129,Greg  Osland,no comments
11130,Greg  Osland,very well prepared for class makes class interactive
11131,Greg  Osland,try to take him for marketing classes if you can he knows his stuff and will work to make sure you understand everything can be a tough grader on assignments esp papers
11132,Draga  Vidakovic,college geometry is a self taught course she literally teach anything if you know what proofs are or have a good sense of geometry this class is not for you she teach she expects you to already know everything and if you know she help you
11133,Draga  Vidakovic,she is terrible just the worst teacher ever i have had a few mediocre teachers in my life but i have never actually had a bad teacher and she was just awful she does not know the material she was teaching and one of the students basically taught our class because dr v got so much wrong do not take her class
11134,Draga  Vidakovic,great caring teacher always willing to help and actually wants you to learn the material if people like her its because they want to actually work for a grade its college you are going to have to actually try
11135,Draga  Vidakovic,nice enough goes over a lot examples a lot of times entire class days devoted just for practice before tests the only thing i hate is that she uses wiley a lot and those darn quizzes sneakup on you.take em early i hate teachers that are on websites to keep track sometimes the website was wrong
11136,Draga  Vidakovic,she really know what she is talking about she always explain questions from students in class and when she does some are incorrect relies to heavily on coursecompas.com to do her work all she does is grade your blue books if you have no problem teaching yourself be just fine she really uses website as
11137,Draga  Vidakovic,warning if you want to keep taking this course over and over again take her she is str8 horrible
11138,Draga  Vidakovic,horrible
11139,Draga  Vidakovic,i enjoyed her group assignments we learned a lot in group her tests are very reasonable
11140,Michael  Rooney,political theory was reading heavy but the tests were directly from the reading one paper brings up interesting topics for class discussion be prepared to think and defend ideas about what good democracy is free speech libertarianism etc good class
11141,Michael  Rooney,professor rooney never missed one class meeting throughout the semester you must get the book for class the semester in all was quizzes midterm and a final and extra credit was available no homework everything for the tests are in his lecture miss his class if you want an a i missed classes and was able to get a b good class
11142,Michael  Rooney,good professor just read the textbook and you should be fine
11143,Michael  Rooney,knows what talking about everything is explained on the syllabus you have to read the instructions and follow them if you follow instructions you lose points no duh not confusing if you know how to read if you ask questions via email he responds
11144,Michael  Rooney,he is a very tough grader he docks points for almost anything all his tests are completely fill in and are very confusing he is biased towards his book being that he is the coauthor try to explain concepts in a different way even when students understand he does not show interest or concern about his students do not take him
11145,Michael  Rooney,where do i begin first off professor rooney is a very knowledgeable person however i believe that this was the hardest class i have ever taken i expected to be able to get by from doing all the homework reading and attending every class session but for some reason i could not succeed the way i wanted or expected to good luck
11146,Michael  Rooney,professor rooney was great he is very funny guy but sometimes thinks a little funnier than he really is as for the class pretty simple the only homework is read and a must to pass the class unless you can listen and learn also there are practice tests online that he pulls questions from so do those too
11147,Michael  Rooney,challenging class but smart and funny teacher you must read the book and take careful notes on how to do the exercises on the quizzes and tests if you memorize the definitions and follow the examples not that hard
11148,Michael  Rooney,pretty funny which makes even hour lectures feel short although he is probably more skilled on how to make his students feel stupid rather than the actual subject of philosophy i started out the class with about classmates and half way through only of us were left you have to work extremely hard to even receive a b would not recommend
11149,Michael  Rooney,the class was hours long but his lectures made it feel so much shorter clearly passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject he has high expectations of his students so be ready to make an effort if you want to pass as for those of us who survived to the end of the semester we loved him
11150,Michael  Rooney,do all the work to get an a it is essential you understand the material it is not simply knowledge based but application this class is basically using common to see if an argument is bad or good it will be hard if you understand the material if you actually pay attention and understand it it is easy extra credit possible
11151,Michael  Rooney,i really liked him he is intelligent funny and clear if taking him for logic in practice you need the book you pass without it the class is entirely based it he conducts lectures through student participation he is a bit of a tough grader but you have a hard time as long as you pay attention and know the material
11152,Michael  Rooney,mr rooney is a excellent professor his lectures are long but crystal clear with the use of humor and enthusiasm which makes the class interesting his class is composed of written work only and he is a tough grader you really need to take notes study the book and avoid skipping class in order to pass the class
11153,Michael  Rooney,i am taking the final for this class tomorrow but overall a good class the lectures are long but it really clarifies the concepts at first he was very repetitive but with more material it was very helpful his examples are funny and if you think funny at all then you probably have boring classmates you have to work but worth it
11154,Michael  Rooney,lecture are incredibly long and boring
11155,Michael  Rooney,he is one of the best teachers i had in this community college although he is hard he is the fairest grader i have ever met if you want to learn how to think critically you should take this class he is very serious and afraid to tackle very critical logical misconceptions but if you want an easy a this the class for you
11156,Michael  Rooney,a new concept students should try studying in order to pass his class one must actually study he teaches the material and it is up to the student to try to understand it you actually have to use logic in his class not just learn definitions although he check the homework it is the difference between passing and failing
11157,Michael  Rooney,amazing teacher intelligent understands what hes talking about hard but well worth it he teaches logic not writing logic very funny loves his work he only uses one small textbook expect to use it a lot my advice you must be able to understand the principle and apply it to the questions like math do not expect to write you want
11158,Michael  Rooney,it felt like a high school class going through the motions but i really learn because it was so basic mostly practice problems that count for a grade class was not stimulating but rather boring.also he thinks funny which can get annoying buy the book because he requires online text take the class only if you have to
11159,Michael  Rooney,this professor is great.he will teach you a lot about the subject he is a hard grader so pay attention and do the hw he grade it but its helpfull his assignments are short and his test are hard take home quizzes too
11160,Anthony  Safaeian,sharing articles that we read during the week is a very good idea
11161,Anthony  Safaeian,a weeding out class for preallied health students very successful at losing students too when those who are left after months and the average on his exam is something is wrong not very interesting lectures lab is fine all memorization and identify tissue we put to use anything learned i recommend
11162,Anthony  Safaeian,works hard to help students actively teaches this is a challenging class that he puts a lot of effort into making accessible and understandable
11163,Anthony  Safaeian,great very clear very helpfull and fair he knows his stuff very well great just great merci
11164,Anthony  Safaeian,he is very helpful and nice he is clear fair
11165,Anthony  Safaeian,avoid this teacher if possible does not test fairly at all makes mistakes frequently and is not equipped to teach at this level
11166,Middleton,nice teacher respectful to students and willing to offer help but is unclear on his expectations for assignments never knew if i was doing what he wanted usually a hit or miss situation
11167,Middleton,best professor in the world
11168,Middleton,long forogt about what the environment really is
11169,Middleton,was interested before taking the course assignements were a joke he butchered the course materialwhat a waste of
11170,Middleton,this is the second course i with him i got an on the first course not saying its easy lots of reading and for assignments you have to use basically everything you know he is boring at time but its the materials fault get you through it an over all good proff
11171,Middleton,he always acts as a gentleman very polite very clear speaking and really helpful to my studying
11172,Middleton,great teacher great lectures great material
11173,Middleton,he is an overall nice guy d i enjoyed what i learned even though it was not my major i got an a on both havles and it was not a very difficult course compared to other sciences love the magic pointer wand
11174,Middleton,always there to help
11175,Middleton,awesome prof
11176,Middleton,boring class i liked oac environment better
11177,Jan  Bittenbender,crazy about her teaching style she used handwritten overheads the whole quarter which included abbreviations that no one understood
11178,Jan  Bittenbender,such an easy teacher all her tests quizzes are based off the notes in class she has some pretty ridiculous things to say though like if you eat a candy bar you should skip a meal get a good seat in class because her big hair blocks the overhead
11179,Jan  Bittenbender,surprisingly tough class very quiet try not to sit in the back gives extra credit on tests but you have to really study to get those points multiple choice tests on scantron with some short answer
11180,Jan  Bittenbender,no comments
11181,Jan  Bittenbender,tough class lots of things to remember but not much different from any other class she gives you a break by giving you lots of xtra credit and makeups really knows her stuff
11182,Jan  Bittenbender,this class was harder than i thought basically you have to study everything in order to get a good grade there is a lot of information and she talks while youre writing notes so by the time youre done writing you havent heard the lecture
11183,Jan  Bittenbender,ms bittenbender would be far better suited teaching at a junior high school easiest a ever earned she is very opinionated and her teachings are definitely biased
11184,Charles  Okeke,one of the best professors i have ever had if something was not understood he stops and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on he actually teaches instead of lectures
11185,Charles  Okeke,he is tough but fair you cannot skip class because he does not allow any makeup for the unannounced quizzes one of the best professors at ccsn i recommend him but be ready to work
11186,Charles  Okeke,great teacher
11187,Charles  Okeke,no comments
11188,Charles  Okeke,i like him he makes me sleepy
11189,Charles  Okeke,he is so snubby i hate his personality
11190,Ralph  Korner,i wish that i could take a class from this man every semester of my school career papers too hard tests too hard readings too many but man did i learn a lot thanks ralph
11191,Ralph  Korner,no comments

11194,Donald  Russell,lovely simply best ever prof highly recommended
11195,Donald  Russell,a very smart professor a good lecturer if you need help just ask very helpful and friendly if you approach he honestly wants you to do well and to teach well so if you come to learn you have a problem
11196,Donald  Russell,this guy is one of the best professors i had extremely helpful both during class and afterwards was very understanding about my varsity commitments
11197,Donald  Russell,arrogant only an associate prof associate dean is just a useless title to make himself feel superior terrible engineering administration anyways a real academic would not sit in admin positions
11198,Donald  Russell,this guy thinks he is the king of the universe since he is just an associate dean he is going to be a bad reputation for carleton i know a single person who likes him try to avoid him
11199,Donald  Russell,no comments
11200,Brian  Gold,bg i owned you if you do not like this class you are not an academic drop out now i have never laughed so much in a class in my life so funny oh yeah no matter what bg says the temple was destroyed in ce no other historian will give a different date
11201,Brian  Gold,bg owns
11202,Brian  Gold,he is very knowlegable about history he really knows his stuff and can answer pretty much any question he can be difficult to approach with questions at times but he tries to be available to his students
11203,Brian  Gold,if you get lost during the class you can resort to writing bg quotes in your margins such as good at geography or not everyone goes around saying an incritite or i am not sure of the catholic doctrine of what happend when the food and wine is digested he has a puzzling dislike for pentacostals though
11204,Brian  Gold,ask questions he will ridicule you
11205,Brian  Gold,no comments
11206,Brian  Gold,attention deficit disorder describes brian sit still and talks a lot during exams which is very disruptive he knows history well and could answer most questions that were asked during exams he assigns people places to sit and seems to add tension to the situation
11207,Brian  Gold,no comments
11208,Wendy  Untereiner,a good lecturer who tried to make things interesting but lectures were sometimes boring it was the material i guess a tough grader spelling of terms needs to be exact but a fair variety of types of questions on exams fairly approachable and fairly caring
11209,Wendy  Untereiner,dr untereiner is passionate about what she teaches which helps stimulate interest class attendance is a must as tests come from class notes show her respect and she will show you the same cares about her students is reasonable about expectations and can definitely get in her classes would take again
11210,Wendy  Untereiner,pretty bland module but passionate about what she teaches
11211,Wendy  Untereiner,lectures are really clear but she is a horrible marker she will take marks off for anything spelling underlining etc marks dont reflect how well you know the lecture material but how picky she decides to be when marking your she is very friendly in class but not so friendly one on one
11212,Wendy  Untereiner,absolutely terrible prof hardest marker ever and not fair at all watch out for definitions you need to put down exactly what she says in class to score marks and if you spell something wrong your whole definition will be wrong
11213,Wendy  Untereiner,extremely wellprepared for class organized lectures high degree of enthusiasm in lecture and lab inspires you to be a better student
11214,Wendy  Untereiner,power hungry
11215,Wendy  Untereiner,is a good prof has good notes for class but tuff marker for tests
11216,Wendy  Untereiner,great lectures fair
11217,Wendy  Untereiner,if a favorite expect a free ride otherwise watch out
11218,Wendy  Untereiner,very good prof great notes but tests are not so easy very helpful at any time
11219,Wendy  Untereiner,makes you interested in botany excellent prof
11220,George  Hardy,this professor is very knowledgeable but has a very hard time dumbing things down you have to be able to teach yourself a lot of stuff this is not an easy tip seek out psych profs for help always trying to make jokes they are never seem funny but amusing required for psych majors so good luck give up
11221,George  Hardy,no comments
11222,Roger  Edwards,not sure how he got the negative ratings but the prof was the exact opposite of what was stated on here prof was very clear very good and the class was really interesting
11223,Roger  Edwards,knows what talking about has trouble teaching it very unorganized lazy most assignments and tests are cobbled together from old ones course notes and powerpoint slides match up and sometimes outright conflict makes mistakes when solving examples but catch them
11224,Roger  Edwards,knows his stuff
11225,Roger  Edwards,this guy is very weird he is like a high school kid he got his so called ph.d by licking his plette this guy must be in the mental hospital
11226,Roger  Edwards,this guy is an old trailer trash proff who thinks some kind of king cause he has his phd his exams are crap and his turtle necks help a sessional that thinks he has some kinda pull since he is stuck on the floor on his knees
11227,Luoheng  Han,one of the worst professors at the university of alabama the only reason people take his class is because it is required for the gis certificate he cares very little about you and the class it is a shame that he has been allowed to get this far at the university of alabama the class is just power points and you have to teach yourself
11228,Luoheng  Han,ridiculous professor tests on subject matter he teach very dismissive when you ask for help worst professor i ever had at ua somebody break his iphone please
11229,Luoheng  Han,the best professor i have ever had
11230,Luoheng  Han,knows his subject of expertise but know how to teach his subject of expertise should be a researcher not interacting with students since he lacks the necessary communications skills yes we are all impressed with your boat please
11231,Luoheng  Han,this guy is an associate dean he needs to stop teaching and just go be a full time admin because he a clear communicator i got tired of him leaving class to go talk on his iphone or how he had to mention that he owns a boat we get it you get paid a lot of money but not because a good teacher and he friendly to students
11232,Luoheng  Han,treat students with respect dude is on a power trip
11233,Luoheng  Han,on a power trip.maybe they run the computer labs like he does in redchina comes to the to his profession
11234,Luoheng  Han,he made interesting subject kinda boring which is hard to do if you try to get things clarified by him he will make you more confused since he does contradict himself all of the time disappointing you can pull off a b pretty easily an a is attainable if you study and can get lucky on some confusing questions
11235,Luoheng  Han,omg hard understand he seems kind of unreasonable as a teacher i would not take another class with this joker ever again terrible overall
11236,Luoheng  Han,one of the worst had and i actually like the subject matter i believe they made this guy the head of the entire department when webster left it is disappointing that our school rewards such incompetance with a department chair
11237,Luoheng  Han,terrible professor useless for help not a straight shooter contradicts himself all of the time
11238,Luoheng  Han,great professor very demanding but you get back what you put in to hig classes
11239,Luoheng  Han,very thorough tries to be as clear as possible uses powerpoint a lot

11242,Trent  Snider,dr snider was an awesome professor i had him for my freshman year first semester of chem dr snider has meaningful lectures and describes the material very well in regards to asking questions anything you get he will make sure you understand what he is talking about by the end of the class his office hours are open and helpful
11243,Trent  Snider,snider is very caring and uses humor to keep your attention he wants to help you but you need to ask his tests are hard but as long as you study you will do fine
11244,Trent  Snider,dr snider is amazing true his tests are very difficult and his lectures are in depth but he makes you want to do well in his class very easy to get help outside of class and makes it worth your while to go talk to him he is also great for lab
11245,Trent  Snider,loved loved loved dr snider perhaps because i love chem lab but snider is amazing to take for lab hysterical and a great professor he is there to help you at any time and has a great personality also make you do all the post lab work awesome take him again in a heart beat
11246,Trent  Snider,dr snider is one of the best i have ever taken yes he is a tough grader but he made me a better student if you do not like online do not take him very caring entertaining and helpful
11247,Trent  Snider,he is hilarious but a tough grader if you go to office hours he would be gladly to help overall just a great person to talk to
11248,Trent  Snider,snider is not an easy grader if you want an a in his class you will work for it on the other hand he is hilarious and never fails to keep your attention siab for life
11249,Trent  Snider,first off dr snider is hilarious he adds humor to the chemistry which makes it a lot more bareable the only complaint is that he grades formal labs extremely hard almost impossible to get an a luckily the other assignments will boost your grade and he was always willing to answer questions inside outside of class
11250,Trent  Snider,dr snider is a good professor his lectures are interesting informative and got a good funny personality just expect an easy a you have to put a lot of effort into the class and the tests are very challenging for a core class
11251,Trent  Snider,he is an amazing teacher siab for life
11252,Trent  Snider,snider best teacher i have had at kings switched from biology to chemistry major just so i can have him as a professor again warning not a walk in the park but his door is always open for students that need help or just want to talk and yes his take home tests will make u cry like a little girl but and he tells you that from the start
11253,Trent  Snider,very very helpful it was a really tough class but he gives extra work that boosts your grade very funny and keeps class interesting i go to him for help even in my other chemistry courses i have with other teachers recommended prof just dont take the class expecting an a
11254,Trent  Snider,great teacher helps you out when ever you need it makes things fun tough grader though dont expect an a
11255,Trent  Snider,i love love love dr snider he is so slick and neat he is extremely helpful and makes chemistry so fun and easy to relate to his take home tests will make you want to die but other than that you will love your life if you take him
11256,Trent  Snider,the best teacher at college he is always willing to help his students out and is passionate about what he teaches i would have certainly done poorly in a chem class taught by anyone else dr snider is surely a professor i would suggest taking
11257,Trent  Snider,hands down my favorite prof at snider is hilarious and he makes the material fun and interesting to learn for once i was actually looking forward to chem instead of dreading it
11258,Trent  Snider,snider is one of the best teachers i have ever had pretty funny and he learns your name very quickly the work is not very hard and he gives you a lot of extra assignments to make up for less than desirable grades
11259,Trent  Snider,funny.you ave group work which was fun and helpful.some of the test questions sucked like the which is bigger problems he rambles a little but otherwise a great guy
11260,Trent  Snider,great teacher highly recommended
11261,Trent  Snider,this is one of the best teachers around i had to chem classes before him and knew nothing now after having him for just one semester i know a lot def take dr snider awesome guy and will help u in any way also very funny chem humor
11262,Allen  Crocket,this person is masterful at implying content to what he says and does i prefer substance seems to have a predilection towards the avant garde and is dismissive of many types of work he feels has been sufficiently represented historically although his personal work looks like lograde abex go figure
11263,Allen  Crocket,allen cannot communicate he dominates critiques and goes on for hour unending about irrelevant information he insults his students he called my work crap he is unprofessional and should not be teaching avoid him at all costs unless painting is your life otherwise he will not respect you
11264,Allen  Crocket,alan is awesome i knew the first time i met him that i wanted him as an advisor he does digress and this bothers some people but i find it interesting he has so much knowledge and so much to add if you want an inspired and inspiring prof for you
11265,Allen  Crocket,alan is a master of digressions and oozes passion for the art world he has a bias towards the extreme avantgarde so traditional artists may find the class a bit disheartening at first but the inspiration he imparts will drive you to push yourself in directions you expect a very knowledgeable fun prof
11266,Allen  Crocket,very good guy but unfortunately his teaching style caters primarily to students interested in pursuing very postmodern nontraditional artistic methods you hear the word technique thrown around too much in his class but otherwise be very supportive
11267,Allen  Crocket,at first he may seem a bit confusing but give him time he is truely one of the most caring and understanding individuals ever met one of best
11268,Allen  Crocket,allen has opened up my mind to the possibilities and talents i can explore within myself he allows you to give yourself permission to explore your own creative spirit and grow with it a huge influence on how i make art i am blessed to have known him and have nothing but gratitude for what he has taught me
11269,Allen  Crocket,he is one of the best
11270,Allen  Crocket,you just have to like allen
11271,Allen  Crocket,prof crocket is very knowledgable and very nice
11272,Allen  Crocket,be patient with him and the good stuff will be there
11273,Chris  Taylor,tough grader but helps a lot throughout the class period with works very encouraging but can be a lot of work mostly drawing still lives with the options of pencil charcoal or conte crayon as your medium
11274,Chris  Taylor,professor taylor is a very good teacher and he always helps to give advice on what could make your art project stronger one problem i see with him is that for a beginning drawing course i think he expected more previous experience than some of the other students in my class had
11275,Chris  Taylor,great professor willing to help available via office visits email and in class not an easy but definitely a fun class to in
11276,Chris  Taylor,i am a senior now and taylor has been by far my favorite professor the classes are well structured and he gave up plenty of class time to get projects done instructor taylor encouraged me to develop ideas but if i was stuck he was always able to help his classes set up a solid foundation for any art student
11277,Chris  Taylor,great professor so amazingly nice
11278,Chris  Taylor,great professor loved to talk about art as well as other subjects very helpful and willing to give personal attention to everyone encouraged students to think for themselves oh wait grading system only goes to a ok an a then
11279,Chris  Taylor,i have taken many classes with chris he is one of the best prof i have had he is always lookin to help and make ur project better
11280,Chris  Taylor,this professor is very involved and loves what he is teaching if your not an art major or have art experience in highschool this class will be vary hard he expects you to have basics do it if you want an easy a
11281,Chris  Taylor,i had him before i transfered to ou i miss his art classes and he loved everything i did very cool guy loves students who do more work than asked i got an a in every class i took of his
11282,Chris  Taylor,i also took art with chris soo awesome and very helpful chris rocks my world gosh
11283,Chris  Taylor,chris you rock man i love you
11284,Chris  Taylor,no comments
11285,Chris  Taylor,no comments
11286,Chris  Taylor,not an easy a but a really serious artist
11287,Ernie  Rice,ernie obviously knows what talking about and is very arrogant at times however i find him very helpful and he is always willing to go over things again even though he looks at you like stupid not an awful class
11288,Ernie  Rice,i have to say ernie rice is helpful no doubt about it however he is authoritarian in class he confiscated an cell phone he is really crass unprofessional verbally abusive he will try his best to make you look stupid he is very full of himself his opinion is to be taken as gospel overall not a very likeable person
11289,Ernie  Rice,he does a good job teaching photoshop and will give input when asked he does take role and you must attend the lab to turn in your photos
11290,Ernie  Rice,ernie thinks very highly of himself can be a bit rude at times and i guess you could say he over teaches some material very simple lab it take much to get it so i understand why he explained everything over and over he also encourages people to ask questions but tears them down and makes them look stupid when they do
11291,Ernie  Rice,gotta love this guy hilarious and he knows his stuff definitely helpful if you stay for the entire lab and ask questions
11292,Ernie  Rice,so knowledgeable
11293,Ernie  Rice,talked too fast gave too much information in too little time it was very frustrating for those who already know the computer programs dealing with him in lab was a bad experience glad over i guess i like him very much sorry avoid him if you can
11294,Ernie  Rice,ernie is a helluva guy go out of his way to help any student who takes the class seriously or non student interested his experience and technical knowledge make him an invaluable asset to the department
11295,Ernie  Rice,not really a professor just a glorified lab attendant either way he thinks way more of himself than he should and is terribly rude and condescending unfortunately no way to avoid him if you take photography just beware
11296,Paul  Weiss,he was a jerk had favorites which he chose the first day of class and if you are not in that group he occasionally pokes fun at you for not knowing an answer and humiliates you in front of everyone says you are making up stuff too and humiliates you in that manner also do not take his class he can hurt you if you are sensitive
11297,Paul  Weiss,never helped students was quite bias toward students also
11298,Paul  Weiss,this prof is teriable i will never ever take him again sucks at teaching anything however he will give you extra credit
11299,Paul  Weiss,has an insulting way of teaching makes fun of students for not understanding material not reliable out side of class never take his class ever
11300,Paul  Weiss,this professor is ridiculous his teaching method is insulting and annoying that and he does not help anyone who doesnt understand the material he mocks them
11301,Paul  Weiss,easy to understand easy to excel gives extra credit questions on tests if you can pay attention the whole period you need to do the homework
11302,Paul  Weiss,he is very helpful and will help you with any question you have he wants you to understand and pass his class test too bad and he is a fair grader
11303,Paul  Weiss,often put students down for asking questions tests were somewhat dificult but if you study at all you shoul dbe ok if you can stand him its not that bad he wasnt very helpful inside or out of class vague and somewhat awful would never take again
11304,Paul  Weiss,a nice guy and will try his best to pass you if you show effort but he just cant teach he goes rediculously fast in spots painfully slow in others and has all his notes on overheads which he changes out b4 you finish writing a decent prof to take but wind up learning most of everything from the book does help in office hours
11305,Paul  Weiss,this prof knows what he is doing but know how to explain all the points to the class clearly he has a different way of doing math than the book he also speaks to the class as if everyone is five years old another downside is that his tests are pretty much harder than the ap test itself word of the review but it help you
11306,Paul  Weiss,not bad on grading not the best at getting his point across better than some but not the best
11307,Paul  Weiss,he was a horrible teacher you must avoid him if you can his exams are hard because they have tricky questions he comes off as a very approachable guy but beware gives you problems from the book to study yet none of them relates to the probs on the exams try to help you during the office hour but still help goes way too fast
11308,Paul  Weiss,no comments
11309,Paul  Weiss,i thought weiss was a great prof he explained exactly how to do the homework consistently day after day and is extremely helpful if you take the time to see him during office hours
11310,Paul  Weiss,i took calculus in high school and his class was great for more in depth understanding however i would not recommend his class for students who have never had calculus before just too many picky things to remember when just learning the basics for the first time
11311,Paul  Weiss,i think his teaching style is good you actually learn the stuff he teaches thats the good thing the bad thing is he sometimes goes really fast in class my suggestion is that if you had calc in high school take him keep up on your homework some of the test problems are right off the homework or review good professor overall
11312,Paul  Weiss,good for students who have had calc before if not see him during office hours do the maple labs right or they will screw you
11313,Paul  Weiss,had worse math teachers in the past i really understand all of the bad ratings here if you do your homework every day ask questions and do well on the tests you should be fine his tests particularly hard if you know what you are doing
11314,Paul  Weiss,it was precalc and that was easy but he is a great teacher lectures and notes are helpful tests are not difficult if you study your notes and the weekly quizes he wants everyone to do well but had no curve you have to earn your grade but it is not hared to do with old fashioned hard work and study
11315,Paul  Weiss,this professor is awesome love to take him for every math class i have to take at kettering his lectures are very clear and always willing to help
11316,Carl  Shangraw,pincushioning proportioning and lowballing if you do any of these things will be ran over by a man with a pipe full of cherry tobacco wearing a authentic scottish bagpipers hat plus he will take your house too obviously live fast or die is a good mindset going in but never find a better teacher to prepare you for the real world
11317,Carl  Shangraw,prof shangraw will come at you like a raging hawk in the very beginning of each semester worry he gets better as you get through the program and will eventually be a nice guy to know and learn from he is very smart and loves bluf bottom line up front and will tell you exactly what he wants for each assignment
11318,Carl  Shangraw,he comes across pretty strong at first scary even i thought that he would eat me alive if i ever asked a question not true he is incredibly helpful and respects you for trying and actually asking for help great guy great teacher he is too funny
11319,Carl  Shangraw,let his big bad this class will kill you or i will attitude scare you at first he is a really nice guy and has had a profound impact on many many students classes not too hard just do your work and follow directions or he may eat you up for that is quite willing to work you on things sense of humor comes across as anger its not
11320,Carl  Shangraw,to say that this man is one of the best profs on this campus only begins to describe the incredibly positive impact he has had on the lives of so many of his students
11321,Carl  Shangraw,this guy knows his stuff just make sure you get things handed in on time
11322,Carl  Shangraw,i loved his class i think prof shangraw is amazing very knowlegeable and concise tough grader but what do you expect its a tough field very helpful he knows his stuff plus a very nice guy with hot daughters
11323,Carl  Shangraw,what a guy no suprises out of him at all help you out with anything just show up and be fine his quizes are nothing more than writing your name on a piece of paper we had tests the entire year which were a midterm and a final if you pass this class do something good for yourself and change your major
11324,Carl  Shangraw,well organized knows his stuff show up for call on time and hand in homework when it is due let his classroom personna fool you he really a nice guy who cares a lot for hthe student
11325,Carl  Shangraw,i learned a lot
11326,Carl  Shangraw,no one can get a in his class he dosent change the materials over the years if u have all essays and exams u will get an a i dont like him personally
11327,Carl  Shangraw,holy cow this is a law class not an army english class get a life man this man may be the biggest jerk on campus he is also a big fat liar
11328,Carl  Shangraw,what a prick
11329,Carl  Shangraw,you will work very hard in this class but what you learn will amaze you an excellent prof
11330,Carl  Shangraw,he cares about the formats more than the essay i wrote a very very good informative paper and i got because my outlines the way he wants them to be very picky
11331,Carl  Shangraw,the course work is demanding but rewarding a weel taught class but be sure you turn your cell phone off before you enter the classroom i really liked this professor
11332,Carl  Shangraw,good prof very knowledgable
11333,Carl  Shangraw,shangraw is the man he reminds me of my grandpa cause he tells lots of stories but they all have some sort of meaning also a big hunter cancelled class for us today nov deer season cause ferris univ is too gay not to stuck coming to my other classes this afternoon
11334,Carl  Shangraw,he is extremely anal about how you do things he is also extremely cocky
11335,Carl  Shangraw,lodi dodi
11336,Nukte  Edguer,if you have an amazing photographic memory you will do well in this course you better be able to type wpm otherwise you miss the slides on the overhead and you need every word for tests and exams she is very unreasonable and finicky the way she marks tests so memorize if you take this course be prepared to study
11337,Nukte  Edguer,amazed at the students who praise her and can only conclude those were students she decided were good enough to favor as she does this a lot she covers way too much material at an insane pace i type faster than average and could not keep up you better be taking only this course or have an amazing memory
11338,Nukte  Edguer,hard to understand but tests are pretty straight forward
11339,Nukte  Edguer,has obvious favourites is rude to people who are not her favourites is not whatsoever clear on any explanations for any type of project even after being asked many times for clarification is very picky as to what she wants on tests papers and presentations i do not recommend this prof avoid her classes at all cost i learned the hard way
11340,Nukte  Edguer,this professor almost made me switch my entire career plan if you do not need her do not take her she is not receptive to any feedback on her teaching methods and will make you feel like an idiot if you are struggling in her classes overall she is not pleasant
11341,Nukte  Edguer,if you want to feel like a stupid idiot this professor does a great job at it
11342,Nukte  Edguer,unrealistic expectations that this class takes up all a students time she does not give clear explanations and gets mad at the students for questioning her she let you finish writing the of long drawn out sentences on her slides so get ready and learn how to write short hand notes if you take this class she provides no resources
11343,Nukte  Edguer,this is the worst professor at bu she provides a disrespectful learning environment and is a bad teacher do not take this class with this professor most people do very poor take this class with another professor
11344,Nukte  Edguer,worst prof ever had rarely follows the text ridiculous test grading scheme marks per point on mark short answer questions uses definitions from the making modern definitions wrong in her eyes rude and unclear in explanations talks quickly need a laptop since notes be in text if you need her dont take her
11345,Nukte  Edguer,dr edguer was extremely kind toward all her students however i found that she had a lot of tough material on biological terms and info in psychology courses even though biology is not a prerequisite if you do take a class with her you will have to study really hard but she treats all students with respect and is always open for questions
11346,Nukte  Edguer,i took her abnormal psych class first then intro to bio psych she is a very nice person and genuinely cares abut her students honestly taking her classes taught me how to study better basically study everything especially test notes i only used textbook for clarification if she cover something in class work hard procrastinate
11347,Nukte  Edguer,tough class she expects endless amounts of detail in your short answer questions on tests the are tough too nice lady though who is very knowledgeable in psychology reading the textbook helped me a lot in the class she has inclass assignments worth marks so make sure to attend all classes to get some easy marks
11348,Nukte  Edguer,took behavioural neuro with her and awesome willing to help with anything not an easy course but if you work hard do okay
11349,Nukte  Edguer,probably the worst prof i had while in university if you do not need to take her classes i suggest you stay away
11350,Nukte  Edguer,mean critical and makes fun of students i would not recommend this professor unclear instructions and unreasonable expectations i would never take a class from her again
11351,Nukte  Edguer,frustrating hard to listen toexplanations are not clear and strait fwd like they should be making it hard to pay attention opposite to olsens teaching
11352,Nukte  Edguer,no comments
11353,Nukte  Edguer,i really hate this prof accent makes her unintelligible spends way too much time on stupid things as a result we are way behind in the course material
11354,Nukte  Edguer,amazing very very tough marker and expects a ton of detail but so kind and caring and interested in your learning as a student a grade for greatprof tradeoff but worth it
11355,Nukte  Edguer,one of my favourite profs but an extremely hard marker once you get used to all the details she wants though you can pull off an a if you need someone to talk to you can always talk to her she is wonderful i kept taking her classes because i liked her not necessarily how hard i had to study
11356,Ron  Weed,dude rocks his web site and down loads helped
11357,Ron  Weed,better than davis i sure say that
11358,Ron  Weed,he is way cute and totally brilliant all in all a great teacher
11359,Bingwu  Wang,this was a very difficult course but he always took the time to make sure you understood the material homework was optional but i highly recommend it since his quizzes are based off the assignments overall if you work hard and seek help this class going to be too bad
11360,Bingwu  Wang,he is great explains things in multiple ways and can answer the questions asked in different ways until you understand homework is optional but is closely related to the weekly quizzes and exams he is silly and engaging which encourages class participation do the homework and ask questions in class and you will do great with the professor
11361,Bingwu  Wang,i love this guy he really wants his students to succeed and a funny guy a quiz almost every week and only exams if you read the book and do homework problems on the stuff you understand you should be set for an a he lets you have a cheat sheet too for the exams
11362,Bingwu  Wang,great teacher easy to follow understand show up take notes do the optional hw and you will pass with an a quiz every week helps you to know material and prepares you for the exams funny when you least expect it would take another math class with him as my teacher ec at the end of semester if you come to class everyday
11363,Bingwu  Wang,one of the best math professors ever had attendance optional however if you attend most of his classes give you extra credit at the end of the semester final was lightweight and took half of the period real chill prof will be taking him again in the future
11364,Bingwu  Wang,the best math professor in his field makes difficult concepts very easy to understand gives homework everyday for practice but also solves it for you next day do those and you are all set extremely intelligent helpful and knowledgeable makes learning easy by the way he teaches take him if you want to learn be good at math get a good grade
11365,Bingwu  Wang,great
11366,Bingwu  Wang,this teacher is amazing best math teacher in the whole department you will never regret taking his math class i am terrible at math but he is helpful and makes his goal to make his students pass he is like a friend
11367,Bingwu  Wang,quiz once a week tests lets you have a sheet with equations and formulas for the tests a good teacher if you try you should be able to pass homework not graded
11368,Bingwu  Wang,good professor has an accent but its easy to get over fair grader simple quizzes really makes sure you understand the material
11369,Bingwu  Wang,always hated math and have only been average at it but professor wang makes it so easy and straightforward his class was a really easy a and like i said not great at math also super cute like he makes jokes is passionate about math and is overall very likable would definitely take him again
11370,Bingwu  Wang,his accent is easy to get used to he does have a sense of humor homework is not graded and he only suggests problems each week quizzes are once a week as well but they are max questions and exactly from the homework exams are based on the quizzes if you hate mathtake him lectures are simple and to the pointhe is a great teacher
11371,Bingwu  Wang,he grades fairly easy the hardest part of his class is understanding his accent once you get past that class will be a pretty typical mathlecture class
11372,Bingwu  Wang,very concerned with your understanding easy to understand once you get used to his accent quizzes are once a week and exams are based on incorporated on quiz makes math easy to understand
11373,Bingwu  Wang,made calculus easy to understand ungraded homework everyday but it really helped for the weekly quizzes tests were based on quizzes and let you use note card for the cumulative final extra credit for attendance very lenient for grading so long as the process is right get full credit even if your answer is off
11374,Bingwu  Wang,excellent professor had him for algebra ii trigonometry and calculus and excellent professor cares very much about your understanding grades fairly and is always available to help
11375,Bingwu  Wang,he is a wonderful math professor i had him for the fall semester he knows his stuff and explains concepts really well he assigns homework for each section but it is not collected or graded theres a quiz once a week and its usually only problems i would definitely recommend him he also is very funny
11376,Bingwu  Wang,very nice guy and shows alot of enthusiasm and humor when teaching his accent is not that bad and he speak in any broken english get ready to do homework everyday and go to his office hours when needed if you expect to get an a
11377,Bingwu  Wang,not a blow off class you should probably put to hours a week if you want to understand the material definetly a really good professor one of my fav
11378,Bingwu  Wang,if bingwu taught every math course at emu i would be a math major he is awesome
11379,Melanie  Toutant,very good teacher

11393,Heibatollah  Sami,this man is ceazy
11394,Heibatollah  Sami,i was really scared to take his class after hearing all of the stories about him he really that bad the problems on the test come straight from the homework the multiple choice questions can kill you i sense any malice in him as others suggest i say the same for brennan
11395,Heibatollah  Sami,he really that bad if you do his work and study for his test you will get a good grade i took him for classes and i think he is a good teacher i actually learned in his classes
11396,Heibatollah  Sami,not recommended to take
11397,Heibatollah  Sami,i do well in all accounting courses except his my time taking him shows no mercy and makes you feel stupid if you answer a question wrong in class
11398,Heibatollah  Sami,i know why everyone is complaining about this professor by reading the material and practicing the problems assigned for hw would result in a decent grade
11399,Heibatollah  Sami,not so bad
11400,Heibatollah  Sami,the worst teacher i have ever had do not take him he failed me he has no mercy good luck if you do i am going all the way to ambler so i have to take him

11402,Heibatollah  Sami,this man is unbelievable i study hard and always do well except with this teacher he is not nice and tests are knockout hard i stand to even think i took this man after all the warnings about how terrible he is the rumors all true
11403,Heibatollah  Sami,this teacher is mean to students laughs at questions and unhelpful he has been teaching advanced accounting so long he forgets it is new to us he needs a reality check by being forced to teach audit for a semester tests are impossible to pass
11404,Heibatollah  Sami,no comments
11405,Heibatollah  Sami,do not take this prof if you are close to having a nervous breakdown before signing up for his class you will have one as a result of taking this class
11406,Heibatollah  Sami,do not take this professor out of ppl who initially signed up for his class only finished the class a tiran with very tricky exams and not very clear explanations
11407,Heibatollah  Sami,no comments
11408,Heibatollah  Sami,if you see him on your roster run away quickly he failed a man with years of accounting experience this student worked at a computer company audited by pwc he knew his accounting sami did not his web URL
11409,Y. Peter  Chung,professor chung is a great teacher sometimes he copies and pastes hw questions directly from the textbook onto the exams and he usually tells the class beforehand what kind of questions be be prepared for free response questions along with multiple choice overall if you study hard get an a
11410,Y. Peter  Chung,prof chung is very straight forward if you go to all of his classes definitely get a good grade utilize the opportunity to go to office hours he goes over test reviews in class and shows us how to do them
11411,Y. Peter  Chung,although chung is a knowledgeable man and understands the material he teaches he is an extremely rude and inconsiderate person i witnessed a total lack of sensitivity as he heartlessly gave this student a very difficult time during office hours for no apparent reason to the point where she was in tears and he was still giving her a blank stare
11412,Y. Peter  Chung,no sympathy for anyone who struggles in this class prof chung gives review guides and his exams are quite similar to his exams even if not a finance major this class difficult and he is a good prof the material challenging and really it is an important course make sure you attend class because the powerpoints are blank
11413,Y. Peter  Chung,i really like finance and this class was a bit of a challenge gives hints on on the test and lectures are clear i read the book for a better understanding goes through a lot of information during lecture so make sure to go because powerpoints have many many blanks
11414,Y. Peter  Chung,peter is knowledgeable my problem with him is he is straight up rude ucr should be more careful about hiring illmannered professors like peter chung and long gao
11415,Y. Peter  Chung,professor chung is one of my favorite finance professor he knows his stuff inside out and very clear in explaining concepts with real world example i know why others are saying his is difficult compared to others his exams are not multiple choice but not easy to get an a the best thing is he curves the class by a lot
11416,Y. Peter  Chung,took two finance classes bus and bus with professor chung his midterms are fairly easy compared to final exam like most of the classes he gives you study reviews before every exam and you are pretty much guaranteed given that you studied all those as long as you know his lectures hw set a and study review getting a is not difficult
11417,Y. Peter  Chung,smart guy tells you what to study so going into his exams too difficult given the assumption you actually studied the median is set at b so passing this class too hard overall the class is good but chung himself can be a bit insensitive although it take away from his overall knowledge
11418,Y. Peter  Chung,definitely one of the best finance professors at ucr if you are a business finance major then it is in your advantage to take chung for chung knows his material and is a very knowledgeable man
11419,Y. Peter  Chung,i took this class twice because i never understood npv fv and fell behind early in the class took this over the summer one midterm and a final homework is easy i got an a and ill tell you how you can succeed i read every chapter after lecture and before discussion take notes during class of his ppt and attend class
11420,Y. Peter  Chung,make sure to learn npv pv and fv early on in class understand these three key concepts and how they work if you do then be less hard to understand the course later on be careful if taking this class with or any jasso class if you do work hard i like chung he knows his stuff which is why not easy
11421,Y. Peter  Chung,class is tough he is not very helpful and is very snarky towards students practice midterms really help because the problems are completely different on the test only good thing about the class was the huge curve because the class average on midterms was
11422,Y. Peter  Chung,slides have blanks so he requires you to come to class to get the notes his exams are extremely difficult and nothing like his practice problems he is sarcastic and rude he does not care about students at all
11423,Y. Peter  Chung,very arrogant and sarcastic he thinks his funny but not exams are ok have to study a lot he is clear in his lectures notes are always posted on ilearn ta sessions are mandatory and also homework about once a week like his attitude at all but he explains the material pretty good
11424,Y. Peter  Chung,he knows what he is talking about all his tests are free response so do not expect multiple choice depending on your class the curve is either really good or really bad he gives you everything you need to know for the test and drops major hints about questions if you did not do well its your fault not his he does his part to help you pass
11425,Y. Peter  Chung,awful instructor intensely focused on theory and overcomplicating subject matter to feed his own ego zero interest in students arrogant and more interested in failing students class average for midterms was below showing he teach the material he expects students to know avoid at all costs
11426,Y. Peter  Chung,my honest comments about peter chung has absolutely no interest in students no charisma poor manner no passion in teaching cold unhelpful and arrogant
11427,Y. Peter  Chung,best professor i had at ucr took a different approach at this class group presentations every week basically a selftaught course no book if you like real world finance and investment this will be a great class and you have to worry about quizzes and tests just learning
11428,Y. Peter  Chung,this guy answers his cell phone in class it would be one thing if it happened once but it happens almost every day total disrespect for a graduate class
11429,Dale  Michaels,michaels is hands down the best professor i have ever had at phillyu he is incredibly intelligent and funny i get bored in this class because he is always telling stories and showing us videos incredibly helpful all around amazing guy oh and he brought his adorable dog to class one day it was awesome

11448,Dale  Michaels,one of he best professors philly u has truly wants his students to succeed and will do almost anything to get them there
11449,Todd  McGowan,really fun in class and defintiely into what teaching be ready for him to get really side tracked and share quite a bit about his personal life almost always hilarious though he really cares about what he teaches and when he assigns readings you really do need to do them if not you can get by but be difficult
11450,Todd  McGowan,todd is a great prof and film can be a difficult concept but he is able to put it in simple terms for new students his quizzes are based of the film lecture and readings so as long as you attend class and screenings you should do well the exams are straightforward and everything you need to know is on the study guide super sarcastic too
11451,Todd  McGowan,ask him a question always answer he explains complex theories in ways you can understand understanding if turn something in on time hilarious and the best
11452,Todd  McGowan,he is excited about class and knows a lot about film though he gives quizzes on random days and never discusses the readings on which the quizzes are on the tests cover material that he has not discussed and you must learn on your own i would have never taken this class with him if it mandatory for my minor
11453,Todd  McGowan,class is one of the best classes i have ever takencertainly one of the funniest to do well on the quizzes you have to do the reading but the tests are usually pretty easy he makes lectures and silent cinema fun and exciting smart and funny
11454,Todd  McGowan,charismatic can make jokes at himself and others one of the best guys ever met he infuses a love of cinema in you
11455,Todd  McGowan,really passionate and his enthusiasm is contagious has a tendency to go off on tangents and on tangents of tangents but always gives the class an offbeat positive atmosphere i may have more of his personal quotes written down than actual notes but his teaching style is so engaging that abstract concepts become much easier to grasp
11456,Todd  McGowan,as someone who has awful add and no interest in movies i still looked forward to coming to class every day the material is easy enough to grasp although he tests directly on readings that are never discussed in class still todd is always good for a few laughs
11457,Todd  McGowan,i love todd i thoroughly enjoy attending his class he makes it extremely entertaining
11458,Todd  McGowan,todd is my favorite teacher that had ever he is such a good person and makes every class fun i hate missing his lectures if you can take a class with him and get to know him you regret it
11459,Todd  McGowan,brilliant and has a great sense of humor
11460,Todd  McGowan,charismatic guy loved going to class and he made all of us laugh a lot i do the reading ever not so great on the reading quizes not so great on the tests still got a b definitely recommend this guy especially if you do the reading but even if you just want to laugh for an hour and minutes twice a week
11461,Todd  McGowan,i have to agree with everyone else here todd is the best teacher i have ever had a really quirky and hilarious his higherlevel courses are difficult but if you make a real attempt at understanding the content he is decently lenient with grading if you ever have a chance to take a class with him do it great advisor and mentor too
11462,Todd  McGowan,i have attended schools and todd is the best professor i have had at any of the schools i was not really interested in the class content at all but he made it interested anyways his lectures are hilarious they are better than sleeping in
11463,Todd  McGowan,i think i could videotape his lectures and make a very good tv show about him he is very interesting and keeps me engaged very very funny and insightful i would recomend it to anyone this is my last semester and i am very glad i signed up for this class
11464,Todd  McGowan,funniest teacher i have ever had and really hot
11465,Todd  McGowan,todd is the best professor ever had like many other students here i honestly believe he is a complete genius his lectures are absurdly interesting and laughoutloud hilarious his assignments are relevant and reasonable and his ability to relate complex information is unparalleled todd has changed my life and i be happier
11466,Todd  McGowan,the best teacher at uvm hands down
11467,Todd  McGowan,todd is one of the best profs had in years at uvm hilarious insightful and really knows his stuff his lectures are pretty much like a comedy act and throughout them he makes or critical points that are easy to pick up on and understand take a class with this man if you have the chance
11468,Todd  McGowan,no comments
11469,Barbara  Gfellner,dr gfellner in her prime was apparently an amazing professor i think gotten burnt out over the years and her class content reflects it i passed because i bought the textbook and just took notes from it i blocked her out during class and just did my own thing from the textbook her wardrobe is super jazzy though interesting to look at
11470,Barbara  Gfellner,memorization regurgitation seem to be paramount no powerpoints made available unrealistic in her expectations confusing lecturer
11471,Barbara  Gfellner,she is boring and not very clear she speaks very quietly so sit near the front of the class
11472,Barbara  Gfellner,beyond brutal doesnt give you enough time to even finish writing on the powerpoint which are not given talks about irrelevant studies constantly you must keep up with reading the text tests are ridiculously difficult
11473,Barbara  Gfellner,in grad school and looking back at all the had over the years she sands out as being horrible more than anyone been fired back in
11474,Barbara  Gfellner,notes are horrible and doesnt give you a chance to write them down also doesnt post them online very very boring classes prof says at least times a class may be a nice person but prob the worst prof on campus not even exaggerating
11475,Barbara  Gfellner,okay i am taking my third class with her got to agree with the majority at first she was my least favorite teacher and i found her useless etc boring etc scattered you get the picture but i ended up with an a and in the two prior classes taken with her and you really do start to understand her teaching methods
11476,Barbara  Gfellner,very nice but not a great prof you spend the whole class trying to write down notes from the overhead while she talks about someting else before she whips them away tests are way too long for the amount of time given take this class if looking for an easy a
11477,Barbara  Gfellner,horrible very disorganized all over the place i got an a but because i learned the whole book on my own i do not recommend her classes
11478,Barbara  Gfellner,amazing beautiful person so caring and passionate about her subject area more than fair tests interseting lectures and always willing to offer extra help super fun lady awesome classes
11479,Barbara  Gfellner,i took this calss with her and it was terrible i didnt know what she was even talking about because i was too busy taking her useless notes i admit i failed i toke it again with another prof and now i have a average
11480,Barbara  Gfellner,herr exams are tough study it all boring lectures
11481,Barbara  Gfellner,i was really looking forward to this class and it was a total let down boring lectures out of the blue questions on exams a very nice person and quite helpful but i still recommened this class
11482,Barbara  Gfellner,sucks
11483,Barbara  Gfellner,no comments
11484,Barbara  Gfellner,this prof is the worse prof ever if i knew how bad she was i of even taken that course and too bad no one told me about her sooner thanks alot guys i think she should be fired
11485,Barbara  Gfellner,study the chapter highlights and the multiple choice from the study guide and do fine her notes are useless when it comes to the tests
11486,Barbara  Gfellner,i never had her but my roomate did and she cried all the tome caus eshe studied soo hardthen the tests would be on nothing they covered in had her twice avoid this teacher she seems a little crazy
11487,Barbara  Gfellner,no comments
11488,Barbara  Gfellner,she is the worst teacher that i have ever had i skipped her class for three weeks and still aced her test all she does is highlight the textbook
11489,Nyenty  Arrey,dr arrey is an extremely funny and smart professor many people find him to be mean but he truly wants everyone to pass his class is extremely hard but its pretty straightforward study everything in his packets
11490,Nyenty  Arrey,dr arrey is the best professor ever had no other professor has ever given so much of their time to help me succeed accelerated ochem are no joke but if you put in your time at least go to office hours and participate in class you can get that a
11491,Nyenty  Arrey,dr arrey wrote the book on organic chemistry literally he uses a textbook that he wrote himself the funny thing is more helpful than traditional textbooks dr arrey has such a unique and often hilarious way of explaining difficult concepts that achieving highly is inevitable study hard go to office hours and be a chlorine guy
11492,Nyenty  Arrey,dr arrey is a great professor and one of the best i have ever taken his class is definitely tough but as long as you work pretty hard and go talk to him in his office when you have questions you get anything less than a
11493,Nyenty  Arrey,very hard to understand what he wants the material is very difficult but if you get on his good side he can be an enjoyable guy
11494,Nyenty  Arrey,i stopped liking chemistry because of this professor he would not hear comments and will try by all means to not give points back even if it was his mistake
11495,Nyenty  Arrey,his classes are not easy it can be hard to understand him i suggest going to office hours and talking to him after class be active in his class he seems mean but he can be very pleasant
11496,Nyenty  Arrey,now being in medical school and thinking back to undergrad the only class that remotely compares to the work load and amount of material is dr organic chem if you want to know what med school will be like this is the class to take and trust me i complained as much as anyone else dr arrey is an excellent instructor
11497,Nyenty  Arrey,dr arrey as he constantly refers to himself as in the third person is terrible arrogant and unhelpful the textbook is written by him and riddled with mistakes it consists of ppt slides which he shows in lecture and there are no explanations he explain it in lecture either also there are no answers in the back of his workbook
11498,Nyenty  Arrey,hardest class i have ever taken he always puts questions on the exam that we never have talked about you have to memorize an ungodly amount of notes for each exam the highest grade in that class anyone has yet received is a b
11499,Nyenty  Arrey,very selfcentered very egotistical hard to understand does not care whether you get the material or not has a god complex so get on his bad side do not recommend
11500,Nyenty  Arrey,the son of god as he once referred to himself in class is probably without a doubt the worst teacher i have ever had it would also be nice if i could understand half of what he said which makes an already hard class even harder be happier to be done with his class
11501,Nyenty  Arrey,impatient unpleasant rude insensitive i could go on shamelessly favoritist and egotistical bordering on megalomaniacal the only teacher at capital ever disliked do yourself a favor and take ochem in summer school or somewhere else at all costs
11502,Nyenty  Arrey,one of my least favorite professors he is impatient and expects you to already know the new material and is frustrated when you understand he teaches his lectures in a screaming toneusually end up with a headache afterwards he assigns ridiculous amounts of assignments that useless to the content of the class never again
11503,Nyenty  Arrey,terribly hard class
11504,Nyenty  Arrey,not a great teacher at all he is funny sometimes but it would be more useful to hear information on the class rather than how many friends we have
11505,Nyenty  Arrey,good
11506,Nyenty  Arrey,so hard and you understand him with his accent
11507,Nyenty  Arrey,he is very selfish and arrogant on one occasion he threatened to put a curse on everyone not kidding in my opinion he puts a black mark on capital i would strongly advise anyone considering capital summer school to avoid arrey
11508,Nyenty  Arrey,i had dr arrey for a year for ochem and i think the class is very challenging but he works very hard to help you and i enjoyed him as a person as well
11509,Fields  Larry,this prof is hard this class is hard and you have to study for it he is a good prof but not easy the lab does help and try to show up to class it seems like that makes a difference to him if this is the only class you have then probably will do good
11510,Fields  Larry,this course was tough but he explained things really well and told you exactly what would be on the test so you waste your time studying worthless crap
11511,Shannon  Gadbois,shannon is probably the best psych prof at bu however my and choices are right behind her she always tries to make examples relatable so you are able to remember them better she also tries so very hard to be available to you and correspond to your needs if you have a chance to take a class with shannon do it
11512,Shannon  Gadbois,tests are reasonably easy if you prepare you are given test outlines she is very helpful gives opportunity for extra marks bonus assignments at the end of the semester she is very well organized and to the point one of my best professors
11513,Shannon  Gadbois,professor gadbois was very organized clear in the course objectives interesting topics were covered good pace of material covered during class times effective power point slides relatable examples instructor provided excellent teaching very approachable supportive exam outlines beneficial for studying bonus assignments available
11514,Shannon  Gadbois,gadbois is entertaining and easy to listen to as long as you commit to learning she will do everything she can to make sure you are successful in her courses fair grader gives of feedback and even outlines for her exams i love her almost makes me want to switch to a psych major so i can continue taking her courses
11515,Shannon  Gadbois,more work required for the final exam than year major projects and minimal feedback i feel like guessing to find the exact study she wants cited
11516,Shannon  Gadbois,absolutely love classes hard to catch in person but always available through email and gets back to you really fast i found her tests super easy as long as you pay attention in class and study definitely would take any class with her again best class ever
11517,Shannon  Gadbois,gadbois gives you the best feedback on your exams because she goes through each short answer question and we exactly she was looking for also the night before the exam she has group chat online so you can ask her any last minute questions you may have which helps everyone so much definitely taking more of her classes in the future
11518,Shannon  Gadbois,amazing she genuinely cares if you do well provides excellent feedback and as long as your putting in the work she will work with you never seen someone care as much as her and especially in a course with very challenging content down to earth easy going and very brilliant wish she taught all my courses
11519,Shannon  Gadbois,very straight forward blunt at times but its strategic and she truly is a remarkable prof and genuine person
11520,Shannon  Gadbois,shannon is a professor sent from the heavens not only is she sarcastic and hilarious but compassionate and genuinely wants her students to do well she gives detailed lectures and gives you time to write down your notes she respects how hard it is to be a student and she has helped me not only in her class but in my other classes as well
11521,Shannon  Gadbois,best psychology prof that bu has by far i enjoyed going to her classes and listening to her stories her tests are fairly easy if you study enough gives bonus marks to help boost your mark she also gives out test reviews and make sure you go to class and know what information will be emphasized on for the tests
11522,Shannon  Gadbois,greatest professor ever had if you print her slides off moodle that is basically your exam if you go to class she makes it very exciting and interesting to listen to not boring at all she references celebrities and tells funny stories to help clarify information and is very approachable if you need help take her for every class possible
11523,Shannon  Gadbois,outstanding prof you know exactly what to study for the exams one time she referenced pitbull and shakira and when i knew it was going to be a good semester
11524,Shannon  Gadbois,best prof ever and not even that interested in psychology but i needed some social sciences totally takes an interest in helping her students succeed
11525,Shannon  Gadbois,dr gadbois is a fantastic prof definitely one of the best profs ever had her tests are extremely fair she gives outlines so you know exactly what to study her lectures are engaging she wants you to succeed take a class with her your gpa will thank you
11526,Shannon  Gadbois,great prof really knows her stuff and makes it easy to study from tests gives real life examples that help to make learning more clear great sense of humor very honest really awesome person and great prof recommended
11527,Shannon  Gadbois,awesome prof is very clear about things and marks fair used many helpful real life examples helped me enjoy psychology and keep on taking it
11528,Shannon  Gadbois,gadbois is a wonderful professor she knows her stuff she is very personable and explains things in nonpsych terms so it is easier to understand
11529,Shannon  Gadbois,she was great i think of anyway she could have possibly made it easier she gives you all the lectures on moodle she tells you exactly what to study for tests gives you practice plus interesting as you can see from the pic being present really into utilizing online tools
11530,Shannon  Gadbois,very informative and obviously knows what doing after you get to know her she becomes a really great person to talk to whether the questions are about her classes or others unrelated to her at all
11531,David  Paciocco,paciocco presented the material in clean fashion sometimes he jumped around especially during the winter term but his lectures are inspiring and amazingly knowledgeable if you want to learn criminal law the right way paciocco is your man just be prepared for rigorous fact pattern exams
11532,David  Paciocco,this class will stand out as one of the best you will take paciocco has a phenomenal understanding of the material and is one of leading experts he is also an equally brilliant the materials and exams are challenging but absolutely worth it do whatever you can to take his classes
11533,David  Paciocco,excellent professor focused and detailed in all of his lectures passionate about the field and expresses this in his lectures
11534,David  Paciocco,paciocco is one of the top professors at the law school and one of the best ever had he has high expectations for his students but he teaches well and sets out his expectations his lectures are completely stimulating there is a reason this man is so popular even though his courses are relatively difficult
11535,David  Paciocco,although paciocco is a leader in his field he does make the material more difficult to understand than need be his classes are incredibly stimulating but again he should keep things simple i found his final compared to the midterm particularly difficult beware of this expect him to ask you to do a memo and essay for the final
11536,David  Paciocco,paciocco is god if you have him count yourself lucky his lectures are fascinating and always tempted to clap at the end of each lecture an excellent speaker although i wish sometimes he would allow us the opportunty to digest some of his ideas his exams and marking are fair
11537,David  Paciocco,he teach bird courses teaches some tough material but every lecture and the whole course are always wellorganized and wellstructured the structure is your friend use it get a good paciocco mark
11538,David  Paciocco,this man is so brilliant that he can barely explain the law to you as he focuses too much on its inherent problems still figure it out and learning from the best
11539,David  Paciocco,professor paciocco brings a practical point of view to both criminal law and the law of evidence very good writer and teacher learn a lot
11540,Deb  Dunbar,super nice great teacher super helpful if you show up and put in effort she will help you to get a good grade
11541,Deb  Dunbar,i had deb for several classes and she is a good professor she tries very hard to give her students the independence and respect they deserve as adults she is very straightforward and willing to help with any issues you may have
11542,Deb  Dunbar,this class was extremely boring easy but boring the teacher although enthusiastic and willing to help use one of the books that was required for the course this course really require much teacher student communication and was too easy to require help the real problem is having the motivation to show up to class
11543,Deb  Dunbar,excellent teacher provides all the necessary resources to succeed as for me i hate economics i basically just memorized the material and regurgitated it back out for exams not the fault though she tries very hard to make the subject digestible i just have a hard time with econ stuff
11544,Deb  Dunbar,deb is a great teacher she clearly explains the material and lets you know right where you stand i highly recommend this teacher
11545,Deb  Dunbar,class is very clear if you pay attention to what she says and take notes class it will be a breeze tries to present real world examples of class material
11546,Deb  Dunbar,no comments
11547,Deb  Dunbar,wonderful professor makes a tough subject easy to understand wants you to know it and enjoy it not memorize things and puke them back on a test somewhat flighty but funny makes jokes about her husband that are funny since hes also a prof at cc would take more classes if i graduating

11573,Anabelle  Cohen,the worst professor ever wasted my money on i think the space is enough to write on her inefficiency of teaching

11578,Anabelle  Cohen,she doesnt teach to the whole class only to about people she never repeats anything if you miss it too bad you cannot ask a question of the related material her reply in the book she writes small and god help you if you nee
11579,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,she is a very unreasonable tough grader attendance is mandatory although you are allowed to miss four class days she will not respond to your emails about missed work she hardly teaches so be prepared to read and seek tutoring if you have educational questions about a lesson she will embarrass you and ignore you as well
11580,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,she will help you learn a lot about writing you need to be organized and do your work
11581,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,she is a tough teacher but she will make sure you learn how to write a paper on a college level and make sure you come to class on time everyday cause she will point and snap you out her class very funny
11582,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,best professor ever
11583,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,she will give out homework but she never picks it up she will also tell us to not be scared to ask her questions but when you ask her questions she will explode and no answer your question
11584,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,dr m jacksonjones is the professor everybody wants she is always on point very knowledgeable understanding charismatic and interesting teacher i had her for world literature and there simply a better teacher she play any games and definitely put up with foolishness she gives and deserves respect respect
11585,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,i took professor jacksonjones in she is an outstanding instructor the skills that she has bestowed upon me has helped me with term papers essay etc i am so thankful for her
11586,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,i love her we get along great she is a wonderful teacher
11587,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,i love her class i have learned a lot
11588,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,im very happy i was able to hv dr jacksonjones as my writing professor she is very passionate abt her work
11589,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,been out of school for almst dr jacksonjones made my new endeavor very interesting im very happy that i was able to have her as my professor.the work at times was overwhelming but well worth it she is very passionate abt her wk she will always be a professor i will hv the upmost respect for evrythg in life is not easy.thk u dr.j
11590,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,dr jacksonjones is a very well structured teacher she tells you what she wants and pushes you to do your best she truely cares about her students she will go above and beyond for you i wish i had her for and beyond
11591,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,mrs jackson is a character and she expects you to work hard she explains her material clearly and gives a lot of hand outs i would recommend her to someone who has been out of school for a while you should pass her class with a b or better she is not a hard teacher and do not get on her bad side
11592,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,i agree with the prior student this is not high is a great best english teacher ever had.disregard the negativity because people are more focused on her than her teaching
11593,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,dr.jacksonjones is highly recommended she knows so much about her really amazes me not only is she knowledgeable but also an outgoing person if you take her class i promise you will learn a lot
11594,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,this instructor is very hard and shows much favortism towards men.she is very arrogant.no matter how good you think your work me she will pick it apart in a hot minute.she braggs about being tenured and her grading is more subjective than objective.all i can say is good luck and it will be benefical to you if you stay on her good side
11595,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,she is a alright professor just get u ready for the real deal so on how ready u think u r for college good luck
11596,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,i was out of school for ten years before i took her class and would not explain anything she is the worst teacher ever
11597,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,if you are a student who has been away from school for an extended time i highly recommend that you do not take this instructor she will belittle you and shake what confidence you have in your writing abilities she is disrespectful and a bit of a narcissist
11598,Marguerite  Jackson-Jones,uses intimidation to control students is more concerned about personal time than helping students most students in her class do not enjoy going because she is demonstrative and rude my advise is to take another teacher because it is clear that she is just collecting a paycheck there are much better teachers at the school
11599,Ken  Daniels,boring disorganized no flow or logical sequencing to lectures but exams are given to you before writing so know what to expect easy grade hella long classes
11600,Ken  Daniels,his lectures are all over the place but i love how he tells you a lot of gonna be on the exams good guy
11601,Ken  Daniels,too much to say in too little time almost half of what is said is over my head he is very smart but hard to follow i have a hard time sitting through class the more you know the higher your mark as it should be
11602,Ken  Daniels,very unorganized but very fair he is very helpful one on one but in a group he tends to be unclear
11603,Ken  Daniels,awful prof most horrible boring class ever take very unorganized and his lectures make no sense half the time he talks about some house he built
11604,Ken  Daniels,great course he made class enjoyable very laid back and easygoing
11605,Ken  Daniels,very very intelligent funny helpful and a cat lover
11606,Greg  Stapleton,why dont you try to improve you lovely news paper and actually make it more professional and instead of insulting everyone
11607,Greg  Stapleton,i have never have had greg as a teahcer but he is a wonderful advisor for the hudsonain at hvcc he is relaxed and around if you need help we appreciate you pork chop
11608,Richie  Scherb,omg runn horrible professor his tests are so hard his slides are a waste of time no review sheet very unprofessional makes you look like an idiot when you as a question does not deserve to be a professor runn
11609,Richie  Scherb,outstanding professor possesses a charisma and passion for subject matter that will keep you engaged and learning the whole way through knowledgeable and willing to answer any question tough in the sense that you have to do your work highly recommend
11610,Richie  Scherb,before i lament on the difficulty i did receive an a in his class the only way this is possible is if you study a great deal wait until the last minute hint his tests are harder than the final but make sure you do as well as you can on them if a nursing major this class is a joke compared to so his difficulty will help you
11611,Richie  Scherb,this professor is no joke ridiculously tough although a nice guys and tries to lighten up the mood in class his tests are extremely hard because on a powerpoint and you have a minute to answer better off reading the textbook than his slides gave a very small curve i studied hard and got a c nobody in that class got higher than a b
11612,Richie  Scherb,okay his class is beyond hard he has good intensions but is no help he feeds you such interesting things that will have nothing to do with anything on exams you will hate this class my tip is if you want to pass the class read the chapters you need atleast times and answer all of the review questions after the chapters your best bet
11613,Richie  Scherb,ridiculous lectured as if we had a phd in bio has to be the worst teacher ever had
11614,Richie  Scherb,the hardest class i have ever taken he teaches as if we are all moving on to pursue our careers in medicine ridiculous ap high school bio hard tests study your ass off i recommend him if you are only taking this course just to take a level science and a lab but if you are pursuing in nursing take him
11615,Richie  Scherb,he is an interesting teacher who tries hard to entertain the class my only problem with him was that his tests are very difficult even if you study he is very intelligent and knows his stuff i would suggest him but just be prepared for hard tests
11616,Richie  Scherb,professor scherb goes by the slideshows really fast and his tests are hard you would have to work really hard in order to pass the class and he puts the lectures on blackboard choose another professor if you can
11617,Richie  Scherb,honestly half of what he teaches is based on experience you know when a teacher tried too hard to make you laugh he honestly made my freshmen year taking biology suck so bad i hated every second an a student and this class made me struggle his powerpoint are based on the test on your own in this class stay away
11618,Richie  Scherb,this professor play any games test are on powerpoint slides and you have a minute to answer each question he teaches off powerpoint but you have all the material you need for the exams on the slides and in your textbooks you have to study point blank no getting around it half the class dropped after the exam u study u pass
11619,Richie  Scherb,professor scherb wants you to pass but tests are extremely difficult i studied my ass off and barely passed each time with a curve this guys is brilliant a wealth of knowledge i just wish somehow the tests were easier i studied each chapter and review sheets i made three times each took off from work to study and still had difficulty
11620,Richie  Scherb,nice guy but ridiculous teaching his lessons are straight from the powerpoint you pretty much have to learn all the material on your own he treats the class as if we are all going to be continuing with biology this class will lower your gpa
11621,Richie  Scherb,he forgets the concept of gen eds harder than he has to be considering half the students in the class are forced to be their by the curriculum why powerpoints exams everyone has their own speed and the right to look back at the questions he to eliminate these options and why are the questions worded like the lsat
11622,Richie  Scherb,very personable and easy to approach teaches mostly through powerpoint slides gives no hw only reading assignments tests are powerpoint slides slides minutes and no going back final was multiple choice and three essays to choose from out of six utilize his office hours study the material and the course is not that difficult grade b
11623,Richie  Scherb,he does not explain or review anything i found myself looking on the computer for help take another prof quick
11624,Richie  Scherb,use power point slides has a good sense of humor if you read the chapters and understand the topic and go through the audio clips that he provides on blackboard it an easy pass just give in the effort to read and understand the topic and you do extremely well on his test
11625,Richie  Scherb,csi needed to have fired him long ago everything you read here is true not only is he an unqualified teacher but for students that strugglehell make sure to point you out in class for an answer horrible teacher and person
11626,Richie  Scherb,do not and i repeat do not take him he made me hate biology he expects you to study hrs a day like you dont have a life he answer your questions no review and of what you studied isnt on the test only take him if you want to sign over your sanity what a freaking waste
11627,Richie  Scherb,professor scherb was terrible i took his bio course and was so lost i am a very smart person and an even better student but professor scherb changed all that his tests are very difficult he belittles you and embaresses you among your classmates and he flirts with alot of the girls very unprofessional avoid this class by all means
11628,Nancy  Estrada,dr estrada is awesome i had her for semesters her class too hard but you learn a lot of spanish she makes you participate which helps you learn really well her test too bad either just study up before them
11629,Nancy  Estrada,kind of annoying with the way she teaches and assigns a little juvenile but you come out of it really knowing the material and she really does want to help you
11630,Nancy  Estrada,dr e is absolutely one of the best professors on campus she knows more about spanish than any professors had and does her absolute best to help you learn everything you can she integrates the language with the cultural experience and encourages students to expand their world and to have fun while doing so
11631,Nancy  Estrada,dr estrada is an extremely helpful teacher she keeps spanish fun and makes you want to learn the material although sometimes a little too peppy in the morning she always knew how to keep the class exciting she knows her stuff and i would recommend her to anyone
11632,Nancy  Estrada,dr e is by far the best professor i have ever had she helps you understand the spanish languages so well and she is very very nice i high suggest taking her if you have the chance she spends so much of her time helping you its crazy
11633,Nancy  Estrada,dr estrada is a wonderful teacher she makes everything so clear and easy to understand she inspires you to reach your potential while being understanding of your problems her tests and assignments are easy if you come to class and try to learn the material i highly recommend dr e
11634,Nancy  Estrada,wonderful prof i plan to continue on with spanish after i fulfilled my requirements but she inspired me to do that very helpful and is always helping plan very cool activities
11635,Nancy  Estrada,very knowledgable i learned more from her in one semester than i learned in a couple of years in high school
11636,Nancy  Estrada,very friendly and helpful prof i enjoyed the class even if my own lack of effort put me behind at times class was always a lot of fun and we usually managed to learn some things too
11637,Nancy  Estrada,really glad to have taken spanish with estrada she gives too many handouts but great and pretty funny
11638,Nancy  Estrada,she is a mentor to me truly my hero thank you nancy estrada i feel really connected to you
11639,Nancy  Estrada,no comments
11640,Nancy  Estrada,i do that well in the class but was mostly my own fault plus the fact that i really prepared by hs spanish dr estrada is a good teacher and very friendly
11641,Nancy  Estrada,no comments
11642,Richard  Shockey,the best prof ever he changed my life
11643,Richard  Shockey,no comments
11644,Richard  Shockey,richard shockey is a hottie
11645,Konrad  Sadkowski,i loved professor sadkowski a very funny guy with somewhat interesting lectures you have to read a lot in his class or else you pass his quizzes are based from his minibooks you have to read along with the class one read or else you pass pretty hard to without them
11646,Konrad  Sadkowski,i loved his class his sense of humor was amazing he also attempted to learn name the only problem i had with the class is that i care for some of the books
11647,Konrad  Sadkowski,way too much work for an lac humanities course a great funny guy but this class was difficult and i went to every class and hardcore studied the course guidebook helps immensely it has study guides in it but tests are still difficult make sure you read the books he assigns the grading scale is super lenient i got a which is a b
11648,Konrad  Sadkowski,sadkowski was a nice guy but his lectures were really boring and there was a lot of reading involved tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale so it evens out a bit
11649,Konrad  Sadkowski,sadkowski is one of the nicest professors ever had i took humanities with him and his lectures can get really boring because all he does it talk and you have to look through your course packet and write down what he says if you follow along then you pass he gives study guides to use before the tests but overall i liked him
11650,Konrad  Sadkowski,sadkowski is the worst professor had at uni sadkowski lacks organization shows up late to class daily is regularly not prepared and fails to make this course interesting he relies on the textbook to cover all of his material sadkowski teaches heavily through pointing at maps and listing european countries dates and leaders rapidly
11651,Konrad  Sadkowski,sadkowski lectures the entire class and it can get boring there are only exams and a couple of quizzes for grades and even with doing all the reading they were pretty difficult he gave ec on the last two exams which was really nice he is a nice guy and has some funny stories to tell at times if you ask him a question he is glad to answer it
11652,Konrad  Sadkowski,overall i was pleased with the class mainly lectures some movies every now and then and you need to do the readings sometimes it was hard to stay awake but it got better as time went on tests were easy if you paid attention and is very humorous one of the negatives is that you now have to pay for the course packet but overall great
11653,Konrad  Sadkowski,i absolutely loved him he made his lectures interesting and i actually looked forward to going to class he made a booklet of all the study guides and lecture outlines for us to take notes on all you had to do was go to copyworks and buy it there were a few videos but mostly lecture information was on tests
11654,Konrad  Sadkowski,a nice guy but very boring lectures i have zoned out so many times tests are pretty tough he does give you a study guide though lecture every class quizzes on short books and tests over a few weeks of material
11655,Konrad  Sadkowski,sadkowski is pretty cool he likes to lecture a lot but does include some discussion and movies his tests are difficult but he gave us all of our study guides on the first day his papers are demanding though
11656,Konrad  Sadkowski,took him for my capstone you have to buy and read several books.grading goes as exam is a to write exams around to pages each.lectures are long and boing.if you read and participateyou will do fine.he is a nice guy.not techsavy so no powerpoints take notes good luck
11657,Konrad  Sadkowski,boring lectures not direct rambles unorganized time better used on reading textbook and studying material on tests always covered in guides hard to know something when not told about it take a different teacher a nice funny old guy but needs to methods of his lecturing cause they suck
11658,Konrad  Sadkowski,be real here people who rate professors poorly were probably poor students to being with his classes are easily understood and do just fine if you take notes and participate in class like you should in any class a nice guy and will answer your questions if you need help and hands out a guide at the start of class
11659,Konrad  Sadkowski,give the course packet to us at all so it was very difficult no powerpoints so you have to write everything down from what he speaks miss things tests are hard no homework
11660,Konrad  Sadkowski,show up to class and take notes and you will have no problem passing this class
11661,Konrad  Sadkowski,he gives you all of the notes in a coursepack at the start of the semester and attendence required but he will bump up your grade if there frequently enough for him to recognize your name the tests come directly from the study guides he gives you and all of the answers are in the course pack very good prof and easy class
11662,Konrad  Sadkowski,you must attend class or you will miss something you need to know for the test he just talks at you the entire time try to keep up with notes and start studying days in advance for the test use the study guide very helpful if i were you id get a different teacher
11663,Konrad  Sadkowski,contrary to what you might have read this is an awesome class if you love history then you will get tons from this professor tests are difficult but that is made up for with the curve off topic discussions started to revamp the class there was so much i thought i new before this class but i learned more than i ever thought i could
11664,Konrad  Sadkowski,he had terrible handwriting organized and skipped around in lectures his tests were awful even though he had a study guide half of it on the test and you had no idea what to expect he was always late to class and just not good
11665,Scott  Peters,peters was good but the class was a lot of work for an lac class i spent more time doing tests and homework than for my major classes there are tests and they are all online mc with a strict time limit but the final is in class multiple choice there are also article reflections throughout the semester that took a lot of time
11666,Scott  Peters,there are a lot of readings outside of class but he covers the main ideas in lecture well papers are pretty big but manageable and he leaves feedback in a timely fashion i feel like i learned a lot in both law and the courts and law and politics and would definitely recommend those classes
11667,Scott  Peters,only grades are papers and exams he is a tough grader you have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers but you can only get a total of one combined all tests are on quizlet but you only get minutes for questions i thought the class was super boring you have a total of papers attendance is required
11668,Scott  Peters,fyi professor scott peters is listed on myuniverse as christopher s peters dr peters has been an amazing professor for every class i have taken with him he is so knowledgable on our courts system and he is so good at teaching in a way that is understandable to those with no knowledge of law or politics highly recommend this professor
11669,Scott  Peters,peters is a really great professor this is the or class taken with him and he always has very clear grading criteria clear explanations during class and a real passion for what he does extremely knowledgeable but if he know the answer to a question you have take time to find it for you excellent guy
11670,Scott  Peters,whole outline of class is done by working in groups very very little class time spent on lecturing and more focused on working at your respective groups extremely intelligent and further sparked a passion in politics for me take if wanting an easy class he makes you work for it
11671,Scott  Peters,professor peters is a good teacher he is passionate about politics and has interesting class discussions his lectures can get long and boring he does a good job of not letting his personal views get in the way of his teaching his quizzes can be difficult and he can be a tough grader you definitely have to work for your grade
11672,Scott  Peters,dr peters is great a tough grader and you have several shortish papers but the lectures are always engaging and often entertaining very clear in grading so there are no surprises when it comes to that
11673,Scott  Peters,class consists of six exams and two papers hefty reading assignments and no break between exams tests are online but are very difficult final is cumulative one of my favorite professors on campus and one of my fav classes wish i could take more classes with him
11674,Scott  Peters,he was a pretty good teacher the tests are a little difficult but if you show up to class and take notes you will be fine really smart guy
11675,Scott  Peters,dr peters does a great job keeping his political affiliation out of his lectures his class is not easy but he is a really nice guy and helps you succeed all his exams are online of them and there is a cumulative in class final based off previous exam the online exams are tough but it is not to tough to get b or b tough to get an a
11676,Scott  Peters,attendance counts for points i finished the class with but he gave me an a cause i was always there and participated four papers six tests online cumulative final tests can be kinda vague so definitely study textbook really comes in handy dr peters is a really nice guy and a decent professor
11677,Scott  Peters,dr peters is the type of professor every prof should strive to be he exudes passion for his material and for student success yes his class is difficult but you learn so much and if going to go into debt i want to learn i also might add the difficulty has nothing to do with lack of clarity or lack of helpfulness
11678,Scott  Peters,almost impossible to get an a he grades the very precisely very good class to take though if you plan to go the law school
11679,Scott  Peters,dr peters is very smart and interested in student learning structure of the class lecture the whole time and we got freedom to work at our own pace he has you do a ton of readings at the beginning of the semester though and gets pretty mad if you do them a good professor but pretty hard especially for a lower level class
11680,Scott  Peters,a very wise guy with a lot of studying not only on his teaching area but in general will make you study a lot and lots of non related readings exams are easy as long as you do the study guide will make you work hard for your grade but if learning is your thing it should be worth it
11681,Scott  Peters,peters was a tough professor he assigned lots of textbook readings along with supplementary materials every class period he has pretty open office hours though really knows his stuff his definitely passable but a teacher that makes you work for your grade legitimately wants his students to learn no matter how rough it may be
11682,Scott  Peters,i personally cannot stand peters i had him for classes because of my minor he is very intelligent and knows his stuff however his grading standards are ridiculous and as a person a little arrogant
11683,Scott  Peters,peters is a nice guy his office is open a lot if you need to ask questions his classes involve a lot of reading lectures almost everyday a short paper a research paper and about exams which are challenging but not impossible
11684,Scott  Peters,very good teacher knows his stuff must show up to class be late not fond of that if going to miss a class let him know uses email alot so check it often definitely do the readings or be lost in class
11685,David  Tindall,extremely nice prof who knows what he is talking about but not an organized or interesting class i was excited because i have an interest in astronomy but the class is completely dull and a bit of a downer the assignment are tedious and do not promote learning at all the testing is adequate if you have time to read the entire textbook
11686,David  Tindall,as an arts student with terrible math skills trying to fit in with honors physics students professor tindall did an awesome job helping me out and explaining things in ways that were alternative to the textbook yes he may not be the young hotshot that buffs himself as the most contemporary astrophysicist but a great professor
11687,David  Tindall,you can tell he loves the material and it is boring sometimes but this class was definitely really cool he made the tests so easy you get a cheat sheet for every one so theres no way to not get a good mark he takes test material right out of the book and only does more challenging math on assignments which he will help you do if you ask
11688,David  Tindall,david tindall is a very nice prof and tries to help but i feel that this course is way beneath what he knows
11689,David  Tindall,horrible run away now worst prof and class ever i thought it would be really interesting but i was wrong i never thought it was possible to make something so boring
11690,David  Tindall,this class was brutal the tests were so unrelated to the lectures and the assignments were all math he give examples and classes were a waste of time he was good at answering his email but spent way too much time talking about his email list in class too and meetings
11691,David  Tindall,i was really excited to take this course but it live up to my hopes the prof is obviously interested in what doing but he succeed in making lectures interesting at all those who attend usually sleep and the tests are not related to lecture material
11692,David  Tindall,his tests are brutal there is no point even going to class he just picks the most obscure facts from the book and makes a test out of them
11693,David  Tindall,class gave me nightmares of the laurencetown beach
11694,David  Tindall,hard to follow sometimes but always willing to help as best he can
11695,David  Tindall,for the question to find the cost is like to find the dampning of the water waves or in an engine oscillating motion to sum things up he is rarely on track with what he is doing
11696,Dona  Fletcher,this teacher is very nice but she is very hard to understand the whole class felt like a huge waste of time i can truly say i didnt learn one thing knew from her the class really felt like she let students teach more then she did lots of test with very little extra points also lots of random papers online you have to do i would never pick her
11697,Dona  Fletcher,horrible so many papers she is a tough grader at least papers due every single week not sure if it is different inclass but i will never do this again
11698,Dona  Fletcher,lot of writing but fine with that great textbook choice test match the coursework covered the issue is if you regurgitate the views she shares not the text or material the way that she wants your grade will suffer
11699,Dona  Fletcher,i could tell she loves her subject but she is a bit scattered and that makes it hard to learn from her i enjoyed being in this class because of the classroom discussion but her lack of preparation is hard to learn anything from her so if you take her get the book read the book do those things and you will be fine
11700,Dona  Fletcher,a lot of assignments clear guidelines fair grading answers emails quickly surprised by the bad feedback
11701,Dona  Fletcher,please avoid this professor at all costs i took this class online and every week i had written pages of research work just to pass she takes off for idiotic things and help you what so ever please avoid taking this class with her online it is almost impossible to keep your sanity
11702,Dona  Fletcher,i toke her class online most of the material i learned was from the text book be sure to underline important sentences and paragraphs you will also need to write a lot at least to or pages per each essay assignment there are two essay assighnments due each week follow my guideline and you will get an a in the class just like i did
11703,Dona  Fletcher,i think that she is a great teacher if you are haveing issues in her class all you have to do is talk to her and she will help you out she will not fail you if you try in her class
11704,Dona  Fletcher,this is by far the worst teacher i have ever taken the only advice i can give is do not take this lady she asks questions in one way and grades how she wants she asks an opinion question and wants your answers backed up with research
11705,Dona  Fletcher,what i understand is how she is the chair of the department and still be the worst professor students have been saying she is horrible for years and she still has her job i understand that i guess the college and division care how bad she is at teaching someone else should be evaluating her besides her dept
11706,Dona  Fletcher,she is the worst teacher i have ever had everything people say on here is true i wish i would have never taken her class
11707,Dona  Fletcher,took this class online and i have taken online classes many times before by far this is the least helpful professor i have ever had if you ask questions she treats it like a nuisance gives vague instructions and then takes off major points for not understanding what was being asked would not recommend her
11708,Dona  Fletcher,her usual feedback for discussions and essays are ok what kind of feedback is that takes off points but not explain why thats not helpful she is a hard teacher and a there is a lot of reading and writing plus some questions on exams are from the next chapter or not at all in the book
11709,Dona  Fletcher,online her directions are clear as mud she counts off for seemingly random things with no explanation or prior warning does not respond to questions and is very rude if she responds to anything this course was insanely writing intensive essays a week and the tests were over unimportant details or not in the book at all avoid at all costs
11710,Dona  Fletcher,this is by far the worst instructor i have ever had she takes for ever to grade assignments but yet she never takes the time to correct her typos like she leaves them on purpose her tests are really hard and most of the things she tests you over are not in the book or lectures
11711,Dona  Fletcher,dona fletcher grades unfairly she is closedminded isnt willing to accept differing views i found her docking me points undeservedly she has a discouraging teaching style allaround professing for the wrong reasons she focuses on her intelligence rather than helping students adjust to her style i strongly discourage you from taking her
11712,Dona  Fletcher,i feel bad here but all i can say about the online class i took with her is third time is a charm partly my fault for not studying as much as i should have but she all that helpful either
11713,Dona  Fletcher,dont take any of her classes
11714,Dona  Fletcher,when you write out an answer to a question on her tests please write an eassy you will get an f if you do not do that why is she the head of the department in the first place there are many other qualified professors that should have that position
11715,Dona  Fletcher,recommend not to take her it takes forever to get grades back and you can forget about emailing her sometimes she never replied back very rude and unorganized
11716,Don  Boggs,don is very much what you will find in the industry very much ego driven if you in his click know it i believe don is a good teacher but what he taught was sometimes wrong and overall cover what i needed to enter into the real world of production if you can conquer don do well in the industry
11717,Don  Boggs,this guy is so into himself and thinks hes tough stuff if you dont get involved and go on remotes you are not liked favorites are clear in his classes
11718,Don  Boggs,excellent man
11719,Don  Boggs,i enjoyed his class very clear gives a lot of examples to better understand
11720,Don  Boggs,wow this class was challenging and redirected my focus on the future and the briefs we prepared were key in learning how to communicate the essentials of a msg concisely wtg boggs
11721,Don  Boggs,comm law is probably one of the toughest nonscience classes at au it was hard but enjoyable some find dr boggs hard for classes but always thought one of the wisest and best profs at au
11722,Peter  Bloom,professor bloom is the best so helpful and wonderful the most approachable professor ever had at smith i highly recommend his courses also a fairly generous grader and adorable
11723,Peter  Bloom,almost years later i remember peter bloom for inspiring me to become a scholar peter taught me the joy of reading critically writing well and thinking logically he changed my life and i am grateful
11724,Peter  Bloom,the class curriculum is very interesting but i say he teaches in the best way he talks to his classes as if a parent lecturing to a thirteenyearold the type of professor who always thinks he is right so he is very critical of his work
11725,Peter  Bloom,peter bloom is one of the hardest graders in the music department but a fantastic professor the exams are based mostly on listening so it is much more difficult for nonmusicians it is important to ask questions challenge him and go above and beyond for his class music majors should take a class from him before graduating
11726,Peter  Bloom,he is one of the most intelligent and wellinformed and not just about his subject matter people i have ever learned from i think his class is extremely informative on the subject of music and world politics and history yes his listening exams are hard but as long as you study for them well you will do fine this class is worth it
11727,Peter  Bloom,people make peter bloom sound like the most inhumane pompous person ever to inhabit the planet but really an excellent professor i have learned more from his classes than any other classes taken here even his tangents are informative take his seminars worth it
11728,Peter  Bloom,while much more cantankerous and demanding than most professors professor bloom retains an incredible degree of integrity it took me a good seventy percent of the semester to warm up to him but venerable and somewhatscary character that he is i hold him in the highest esteem
11729,Peter  Bloom,prof bloom is a brilliant but arrogant man that will not hesitate to make fun of anyone in order to make himself look better be careful as you can learn a lot from his classes but can get a lot of grief from them as a result of his perfectionism and high handed manner as well
11730,Peter  Bloom,although you learn a lot in his course there is just way to much music to memorize for his listening exams he expects you to know a great deal about music coming into the class which not only means being able to read music but also to be able to easily explain synphonies string
11731,Peter  Bloom,the tests and papers are largely based solely on reading and outside work i could do as well on them not having ever gone to class and i got a in the class hes mean unhelpful plays favorites and spends too much time talking about france
11732,Peter  Bloom,really tough class but you will learn a lot really funny too
11733,Peter  Bloom,no comments
11734,Peter  Bloom,this class is a ton of work and the exams and papers are bad his exams are hard the papers are easy but graded harshly he really knows his stuff but a little unrealistic when it comes to his students he also plays favorites
11735,Peter  Bloom,no comments
11736,Maria Beth  Grabe,i loved dr telecom class she really knows all of her stuff and i found her lectures interesting and at times very enjoyable she uses a lot of examples and often asks for people to participate and i often felt bad because hardly anyone beyond the same few would participate really cheerful and has a great sense of humor
11737,Maria Beth  Grabe,her lectures are extremely boring and a lot of the things on the tests are from the lectures she uses the entire hour and minutes every class i recommend attending every class but after the week you will start to question why you are attending
11738,Maria Beth  Grabe,awesome professor really tries to get you to think the tests can be a bit tricky but if you show up listen to what she says skim the readings and do the assignments you should be golden the topic is interesting and she teaches it well highly recommended
11739,Maria Beth  Grabe,lectures were interesting but class was harder than it needed to be there were exam questions from the textbook about things that were never discussed in class the grading system was unfair for the papers as points were taken off for no reason making it hard to get the grades you deserved
11740,Maria Beth  Grabe,do not take her for any classes she is terrible with handling grades and getting papers back on time she is very unorganized and rude when people go against her perception of what is right urge you to take someone else
11741,Maria Beth  Grabe,lectures are interesting but she can be very closeminded you need to go to class every day no exceptions miss too much grading for papers is mostly fair but can be fairly arbitrary at times the tests are multiple choice but with short answer type questions which makes them tricky and sometimes potentially wrong
11742,Maria Beth  Grabe,i am now in the real world of journalism and i credit her for helping me build the right skills and encouraging me to see that i can be successful in a tough business i say this yrs later she is tough but worth it not sure how she is in telecom but if similar at all take the class
11743,Maria Beth  Grabe,the assignments were extremely easy but she tried to trick you for the tests which made them impossible
11744,Maria Beth  Grabe,very hard class organized posts helpful class notes tests are hard she finds a way to trick you assignments that hard but the take off points for no reason and all those missed points really add up not many people get although she uses videos as examples alot i find myself staring at the clock the whole time
11745,Maria Beth  Grabe,this class is highly recommended the tests are fair so go to class and study she is a good teacher and uses a lot of examples just hope that the ai grading your papers is fair as well
11746,Maria Beth  Grabe,although she is a very difficult teacher she is always there to help she is one of my favorite professors i have had highly recommend as long as you are prepared to attend class
11747,Maria Beth  Grabe,honest to god the best prof had very intelligent and extremely helpful you help but like her
11748,Maria Beth  Grabe,class lectures were interesting at times she seems like a nice woman her tests can be kind of difficult and she is rather strict with the grading of assignments just make sure you go to every class and take notes during the lectures and be fine for exams
11749,Maria Beth  Grabe,class is pretty interesting but can be pretty boring tests are pretty hard
11750,Maria Beth  Grabe,this professor is very knowledgeable and her tests in j210 were cake but she was very rude to me and other students she promotes class conflict and makes assignments more difficult than they need to be her personality is very abrasive
11751,Maria Beth  Grabe,this class is completely subjective and she teaches it very unfairly she let half the class have cameras for a week longer than the rest of our class and still considers it to be a fair assignment she told us to pretend it was like survivor sorry but i remember signing up for a tv show at registration
11752,Maria Beth  Grabe,hard grader and went to all lectures studyed all notes and materials given and failed the mid term ended up dropping class
11753,Maria Beth  Grabe,a superb journalist and person excellent writing skills she will force you to think of a million different methods to convey a thought it matter if you want to be in front of the camera or behind it she will support you percent
11754,Maria Beth  Grabe,no comments
11755,Maria Beth  Grabe,took of her courses in broadcast journalism track loved her challenging prepared me for the real world of journalism
11756,Radhika  Parameswaran,this is the second class taken with dr p and she never disappoints for someone who is enormously busy and hugely respected in her field dr p always comes prepared to class always has excellent feedback and knowledge to impart and always makes class engaging if you do the reading a lot learn so much highly recommend
11757,Radhika  Parameswaran,radhika is intelligent charismatic and tough push you to think about race and gender in a new way and push you to do the work this is not a class you can skate by in without doing the reading but putting in the effort is worth it a great instructor and the class is enlightening and entertaining highly recommend
11758,Radhika  Parameswaran,one of the best classes i have taken at iu and that is because professor parameswaran was so fantastic the nature of the course is interesting so that really helps when there is a lot of reading assigned prof p makes you work for your grade but she is very genuine and is one of the best personalities of the iu journalism faculty
11759,Radhika  Parameswaran,radhika is by far one of the worst teacher i have ever had you must attend class everyday to take the participation assignments that are really hard the exams are impossible because they are completely based on the readings which are pages per night do not take this class
11760,Radhika  Parameswaran,she is one of the hardest graders ever she makes fun of the journalism degree constantly and says that going to make us work twice as hard when we come to her class her assignments are ridiculous and she makes it very difficult to have a good grade in the class without staying up all night to finish her assignments
11761,Radhika  Parameswaran,her lectures are not interesting at all and the material on the exams is all based on the textbook readings which are easily multiple chapters and multiple articles per night she is useless when it comes to help and unforgiving about students specific situations the inclass assignments are like mini tests.do not take this class with her
11762,Radhika  Parameswaran,very helpful and her class is interesting you have to read a lot but a research course so you kind of have to figure that fun teacher though
11763,Radhika  Parameswaran,awesome professor intelligent lively funny enthusiastic do the readings or you will be screwed at the end of the semester be active in class ask questions if you need help a hard grader and her tests are tough if you pay attention in class and do assignments be fine one of my fave classes at iu
11764,Radhika  Parameswaran,have to do readings every time they are assigned on tests she is so specific if you dont say what shes looking for its wrong have to work veryy hard
11765,Radhika  Parameswaran,she gives extremely thoughtprovoking lectures and is great at sparking discussion however i say i learned anything new mostly we discussed current events worse she encourages creativity on papers but in grading them she just wants students to spit back the reading and way way too much reading homework
11766,Radhika  Parameswaran,help
11767,Radhika  Parameswaran,great professor she did not say we should not critique the readings just asked us to do it respectfully
11768,Radhika  Parameswaran,she is passionate about her subject and it comes through in her teaching breaking down readings in class encouraging students to voice their interpretations giving clear instructions and guidance on her expectations for each assignment are just some of her strong points fab professor approachable great sense of humor prof parameswaran rocks
11769,Radhika  Parameswaran,she is so full of herself and pathetic prof p stands for pathetic and positively ghastly take this class she has no substance and you learn a single thing in this class
11770,Radhika  Parameswaran,prof p is the best to those who said she was biased only biased against people who care about the show up i recommend the class to people who interested in advertising or people looking for an easy a but if you show up hand in decent work and participate a great prof and you will do well
11771,Radhika  Parameswaran,bad class final study guide is more than pages books are dull if you have no interest in race gender or media dont take
11772,Radhika  Parameswaran,great class radhika is fantastic she has great energy and is brilliant but not condescending
11773,Radhika  Parameswaran,oh god she is aweful and biased ever take her class unless its the last class on earth and you have no other choice even then it would be better without her class
11774,Radhika  Parameswaran,prof p is the best professor i have ever had she is so helpful and you can definitely tell that she loves her students and her job make sure you take at least one class with her
11775,Radhika  Parameswaran,radhika is awesome she is one of my favorite profs at the j school definately take race gender and the media it should be required
11776,Deborah  Farrer,good teacher

11788,Deborah  Farrer,great professor easy grader always willing to help are very easy to attain
11789,Deborah  Farrer,the best teacher i had so far at cal very involved with her students success and very easy to talk to
11790,Deborah  Farrer,dr farrer is the best professor had so far here at cal she is all about student success she will bend over backwards to help you in any way she can wonderful teacher the class can be very repetitive esp if you have the intro class too just go to class and be guarenteed an a
11791,Deborah  Farrer,dr farrer is a great teacher and really cares about her students attendance is not mandatory however if you miss three or more classes points will be lost from your final grade class is easy and the teacher is great
11792,Deborah  Farrer,one of the best professors you will every have organized and fun will listen and help you understand i recommend you take her for any class she teaches you will learn
11793,Deborah  Farrer,dr farrer is by far the greatest professor at cal she is organized and clear which are great attributes to model to future teachers she was my absolute favorite

11796,Aaron  Fogel,worst professor i have ever had lectures jump from topic to topic hard to follow his train of thought type of professor that somehow is convinced that the shape of the letter g has to do with some deep meaning in the text and the author definitely meant to do that no sitting in class right now with him ridiculously annoyed
11797,Aaron  Fogel,his lectures were very confusing he pretty much talked and occasionally wrote words on the board you can get by without doing much of the reading and it was an easy
11798,Aaron  Fogel,great professor essays and tests are straight forward good class for people who do not want to participate because it does not count
11799,Aaron  Fogel,professor fogel is a very nice and smart man but he is extremely confusing as a lecturer we constantly skipped around in every book we read which made it very difficult to understand what was going on he is available for help but his explanations or answers to questions are often confusing grading is pretty fair
11800,Aaron  Fogel,professor fogel is simply the greatest he is so incredibly knowledgeable but not intimidating at all he is superhelpful during office hours and in emails and is always willing to meet with students even if it means coming outside his office hours he is tough but so open to hearing other ideas so glad i took his class
11801,Aaron  Fogel,professor fogel is my favorite so interesting and funny also sort of an old hipster prof which is kind of funny at first i was thinking about switching out of his class because he mumbled so much and acted so nervous on the first day but glad i did it his grading too hard and the reading is pretty light take his class
11802,Aaron  Fogel,such an insightful hilarious man at first i was put off my his mumbling ways but trust me once you get to know him all his interests manners tastes asides and honest skill as a professor become entirely endearing helped me to look at poetry in a new way
11803,Aaron  Fogel,i had fogel back in the mid and he sounds like still the same guy funny encouraging remarkably insightful and sparks insights into lit that i never had from any other prof before or since run walk to be in one of his classes
11804,Aaron  Fogel,ive taken fogel twice you gotta love him get so excited about lines or words in poems and tell us his theory about them that will take up a third of the class always makes jokes about having read things over and over for years come up with an interesting new idea about a poem or book and if he gets it in any way appreciate it
11805,Aaron  Fogel,has been teaching english for years loves lit constantly talks about the beauty of a passageor how this one line is worth studying the entire semester forseriously compared to other lit courses the reading is fairly lightabout chapters per class but my first paper grade was a vague which you should expect a lot of
11806,Aaron  Fogel,staggeringly intelligent very funny and kind professor fogel is wonderful albeit very scatterbrained his grading varies from fair to hard expect an a on either of the papers he assigns sometimes hard to understand what questions you should be asking and his answers always make things any clearer but he is a great professor
11807,Aaron  Fogel,words cannot describe the love that i have for this manhe is my hobbyhorse but seriously his methods of teaching are extremely sophisticated and innovative and i recommend him to anyone who seeks alternative teaching methods especially in english
11808,Aaron  Fogel,this man is a genius plain and simple
11809,Aaron  Fogel,i wish that i could have only him as a professor for the rest of my life he is so wonderful and encouraging and he force you to speak if you want to incredibly intelligent and nice and he deserves some sort of award or at least a raise
11810,Aaron  Fogel,asks relevant questions about the text
11811,Aaron  Fogel,took him for hu221 and en536 american poetry hands down my favorite english professor at bu basically a genius and such a kind humble and funny person take his courses if you love to close read he really gives you the freedom to offer interesting offthewall readings basically say enough take his classes
11812,Aaron  Fogel,an incredible professor modern british novel was my favorite part of tuesdays and thursdays the material is difficult but prof fogel is very encouraging and helpful in addition probably the funniest professor encountered his mind seems to work at lightspeed
11813,Aaron  Fogel,no comments
11814,Aaron  Fogel,passionate funny and very clear in advice on how to improve both writing and comprehension
11815,Aaron  Fogel,loved him in hu but his modern lit class was the worst nightmare of my senior year he was unclear in giving paper topics then would complain later and make you rewrite the paper argh it was so frustrating
11816,Lauren  Perdue,dont take her she is extremely unprofessional talks about personal life in class a lot yet still expects you to somehow learn materials and take tests on them basically a huge waste of time and money tests are confusing and unclear will tell you wrong when you question her have to teach yourself basically
11817,Lauren  Perdue,dr p is an odd character but overall psych of women is very easy the class consists of or take home exams and no homework or quizzes very easy she will go off on a tangent for hours if you let her
11818,Lauren  Perdue,easy a for sure administered the wrong exam twice to us still made us take the correct exams sure she lost exam because we still received our grades the semester is about to end gets off topic definitely feel like a level course she is a nice lady and accepts late work exams mult choice one paper
11819,Lauren  Perdue,absolutely horrible does not teach at all class is a waste of time she just reads the powerpoints out loud to the class never learned anything from her just taught myself everything with the book if you read the book be fine for the exams you can avoid taking her then do bc social psychology is very interesting just not with her
11820,Lauren  Perdue,i buy the book because she here for the first week of classes ended up with a b and i normally get she does not teach she reads tests all multiple choice last tests she gave study guides because no one was passing pretty outthere and rambles a lot may have done better if i bought the book but unnecessary
11821,Lauren  Perdue,she is a great person funny and personable but she teach be happy if just a ge class but if a psych major be disappointed about how much you learn an easy a though
11822,Lauren  Perdue,dr perdue is the worst professor i have ever had she does not teach well at all the only grades you get for the class are exams including the final and the wording of the exams is difficult to understand very awkward teacher and she care about the students switch if you can
11823,Lauren  Perdue,avoid her teach at all only gives tests that are multiple choice the only way pass those is by reading the book because she doesnt make powerpoints or write notes rambles a lot class drags withdrew out of this class never taking a class with her again
11824,Lauren  Perdue,worst professor at ccsu avoid her if you can because you learn
11825,Lauren  Perdue,worst professor at ccsu avoid her if you can
11826,Lauren  Perdue,i honestly have trouble coming up with how to describe her as a professor disorganized offtopic irrelevant and even contradicted the assigned textbook material often enough for it to be an issue however i barely showed up to class never bought the book took all her tests at the end of the semester she allows makeups and got an a
11827,Lauren  Perdue,i was so hot and cold with this class there were some days where she actually taught the material and other days where she just rambled on about nothing and made me wish have stayed home in bed she can be pretty funny and sometimes her lectures were interesting
11828,Lauren  Perdue,dr perdue has her good moments but i would avoid her if you have the chance she is super opinionated and shoots down others opinions before they even try to share very intimidating does not like to answer many questions and rarely answers emails she does allow for make up exams the study guides she gives help much read the book
11829,Lauren  Perdue,this professor is not clear about her expectations at all all of her exams are take home and you will not learn anything about the material in class use the book to find the answers she clearly hates men and fights stereotypes about women using stereotypes about men avoid this professor at all costs she is petty and spiteful in her grading
11830,Lauren  Perdue,she is the least conventional professor i have ever had she is fearless in sharing her opinions and experiences an incredible person to learn from if a young woman looking to be inspired to stick it to the man take this class not a hard class if you can articulate your opinions and are a good reader
11831,Lauren  Perdue,very easy class attendance is not mandatory but if you sit in the front row and are absent she will remember your face and wonder where you are very accommodating to those with disabilities gives a make up exam session at the end if you miss the one in class get ready to hear about her own sex life
11832,Lauren  Perdue,if you have a choice do not take her people say she is honest but more like disrespectful its her opinion or nothing her tests easy and i end up teaching myself because she talks in class instead of teaching she does have makeups if you miss the test though attendance is not mandatory i never look forward to this class
11833,Lauren  Perdue,dr perdue is a real person very honest and interested in making sure you understand that life outside the classroom gum drops and lollipops i love her grit and her approachability she gives many first hand examples and her laugh may startle you but she is fabulous a very very smart professor
11834,Lauren  Perdue,i took her for social psychology she is sweet and outgoing help you a lot if you need it but get ready for a weird but awesome teacher her class is easy i barely opened my text book whatever she goes over in class is on her tests and let you know whats on it the class before take her
11835,Lauren  Perdue,great teacher that makes you actually think not only about the lecture but about going on in our society and the world can be a bit boisterous at times but i think doing so to get attention.come to class take notes read the text walk away learning alot
11836,Charles  Hadley,dr hadley is a teacher of the past students can learn a lot from him if they overlook his nastiness which occurs a lot he expects a lot from you and he wants you to expect more from yourself he is also getting older so that is why he sometimes seems forgetful overall a wonderful and funny man who has an incredible amount of knowledge to offer
11837,Charles  Hadley,hadley could be harsh but you just have to take it in stride an old man who knows by now that not everyone is going to like him so he try to be the favorite professor you have to be a drama major to make him like you you just have t
11838,Charles  Hadley,i think dr hadley is an amazing person and an amazing professor i was neither a theater major nor did i make him food and he liked me i found in my experiences that the students who disliked him really were the idiots after my undergrad and degree i have yet to know another professor with such balanced knowledge and experience
11839,Charles  Hadley,dr hadley can be an aquired taste a lot of what he says he mean all you have to do to get decent grades in his class is do do your homework and participate and right though as a generation we know a lot about technology but not a lot about world affairs
11840,Charles  Hadley,hadley is very mean and a very unclear professor needs to work on his people skills although he have them figured out by now will not like you in class unless a major be forewarned
11841,Charles  Hadley,no comments
11842,Charles  Hadley,no comments
11843,Charles  Hadley,this man is horrible she should be fired and put in a mental ward me talks about how me knows so many famous people but beyond that he is a nobody as far as i am concerned his tests make no since you have to make him food to get a good grade
11844,Charles  Hadley,dr hadley can be downright mean he once called our entire class idiots in short i did not enjoy being in his class although i did well
11845,Kevin  Kourey,dr koury used to be my advisor then he was promoted and never told me he was no longer my advisor i went a whole semester with no advisor and never even knew it because he never returned calls or emails and never had time to meet me when i did speak to him he was rude and lazy and knew nothing about anything he is a waste of space avoid him
11846,Kevin  Kourey,wow not sure that there was even a teacher in the room most of the time really off track this semester would have rather had seman and learned something
11847,Kevin  Kourey,i agree nice but constantly lost
11848,Kevin  Kourey,a really nice guy but the class is often unclear of his expectations and requirements if you love suspense and want to be left guessing the whole semester he is your guy
11849,Kevin  Kourey,very nice guy good sense of humor very helpful
11850,Kevin  Kourey,he is in my opinion one of the better professors on this campus he is also a pretty easy going and funny guy
11851,Kevin  Kourey,no comments
11852,Kevin  Kourey,very easy and nice to look at
11853,James  Garner,try having a physics professor as a father highexpectations you must go to class read the text youtube for more clarity and then ask questions and go to office hours yup my dad lol
11854,James  Garner,dr garner is so unorganized when teaching he writes all over the board with arrows everywhere and so unclear to read do not take him whatever you do and the tests are difficult
11855,James  Garner,intro physics teacher.did not like this class at all he was a nice guy and he obviously knew the material but could not teach it to students he assumed you would just get it after a practically no explanation try to avoid
11856,James  Garner,a great guy a nice teacher and his class is kinda easy if you take notes and read the book i took him for lab and it was really easy as far as for lecture really nice and will take time to help you out of class but he is a theorist and most of the answers for the homework in the book he made are wrong very unorganized
11857,James  Garner,difficult to understand and he wrote the text so the book becomes useless as well tests are hard attendance is needed to get a grade for clicker problems and homework tends to be complicated as well difficult to know your grade thus my entire class was left wondering whether or not we were passing with an a or completely failing
11858,James  Garner,good guy a lot of people like him but i think they are the teacher for the subject matter dispite other comments i would recomend him kindy nerdy as are all science people on occasion pretty funny in a physics professor kind of way go to class take good notes study keep upyou can do well but you gotta try
11859,James  Garner,good guy a lot of people like him but i think they are the teacher for the subject matter dispite other comments i would recomend him kindy nerdy as are all science people on occasion pretty funny in a physics professor kind of way go to class take good notes study keep upyou can do well but you gotta try
11860,James  Garner,class is very stressfull luckily he curves his grading scale and i somehow managed a b too often the questions on the exams were nowhere in the book or notes we took i would stray away from this professor if possible
11861,James  Garner,if you have to take intro to physics take it at fccj basically do not take garner for intro to physics he is horrible the worst professor ever had
11862,James  Garner,very inconsistent and unclear adds unnecessary things that trip you up very intelligent man horrible professor writes his own textbook for intro physics basically useless maybe not used to teaching introductory courses do not take him for intro to physics
11863,James  Garner,most definetly the worst professor ever had i am a straight a science student and failed the first test the book is impossible to follow he wrote it and is littered with mistakes he treats intro physics students as if had physics before i can usually learn from the text if the professor is horrible but he wrote the book too
11864,James  Garner,dr garner is by far the worst prof ive ever had his notes in class are pointless because all he does is prove or equations and where the equations came from then be able to work complex problems with little examples he doesnt care about his students at all we started the class with plus students and today in the final there was
11865,James  Garner,lectures are pretty well organized but he feels like he must prove every formula tests and quizzes are similar to examples and homework gives extra credit on friday classes for attendance sometimes not a bad class if you study
11866,James  Garner,a pretty good lecturer his lectures are organized and straight forward his quizzes are pretty much like the homework problem he assigns the exams are mostly multiple choice written prob and he gives you a formula sheet to use i find it to be easy if you study the hw problems he posts solutions online before the exam great prof
11867,James  Garner,wish he was a gardener and not a teacher must have trained lev cuz they both are the two worst professors i have ever had i passed calc with a b so math my problem bad teacher some reason tests are scantron it is a math class how does that make sense ah he is too lazy to grade
11868,James  Garner,nice guy really loves physics he tries hard but is not too good at explaining physics good enough for people to really understand it
11869,James  Garner,the worst teacher i have ever had he cannot explain how to do anything relevant the main points that you need to know come after minutes of nonsense proof do not take him for calculus based physics worst teaching job ever
11870,James  Garner,he makes it harder than it has to be course moves very quickly the gradding scale is the only saving grace is an a b c d and he drops your lowest test and quiz grade seems ridiculous but you will need it our class average on the last test was a good luck
11871,James  Garner,dr garner has a god complex i took him when it was still and he told us this class is too easy to be upperlevel i went to see him during office hours to discuss homework i complete his advice do the homework
11872,James  Garner,seems to have a hard time explaining physics although he tries hard i did think the tests were pretty fair though i studied little and pulled off an a
11873,Jim  Baker,great class easy but you do learn a lot both from the text and instructors experiences great guy and easy going but can put you to sleep sometimes especially after a lunch at speeds deli mm speeds
11874,Jim  Baker,no comments
11875,Jim  Baker,no comments
11876,Jim  Baker,easiest professor ever had in my life if you get an a in this class an idiot exposed to a lot of great info sometimes a little dull extremely respectful and considerate of students
11877,Jim  Baker,one of the easiest teachers ever with a goal of giving everybody an a also one of the nicest guys ever
11878,Jim  Baker,i have to agree the vidoes suck and you can go maybe time every two weeks and get an a all open book tests i didnt even read one newonce in the book and got a a anyone need a highlighted book with test letme know
11879,Jim  Baker,this is one of the most retarded classes ever taken every single class has a video and none of them are new than the most of them are terrible quality yet the tests are taken straight out of an outdated redundant textbook poor teacher
11880,Jim  Baker,what a cool teacher.this is one of the best teachers at this school.easy but you learn a lot
11881,Jim  Baker,too many videos too much reading straight from
11882,Jane  Nodine,not a handholder for sure but if nodine causes you to have a mental breakdown you probably need to reconsider your ambition to be an artist in a highly competitive and ambiguous field tough but fair and does not cater to slackers or those who think they are special snowflakes she always helps those who work hard and have the guts to ask
11883,Jane  Nodine,i had dr nodine for printmaking i and while she nearly killed me in design she was awesome in this class have to work hard outside of class in order to finish your projects on time but work actually enjoy obvious nodine adores teaching this class take this class if at all possible funnest art studio class ever had
11884,Jane  Nodine,very hard teacher makes you work like a dog for a good grade very condescending and unclear got nicer and easier halfway through the class but only because one of the students nearly had a mental breakdown last half of the semester was fun i learned a lot but still i recommend taking a class with her unless you absolutely have to
11885,Jane  Nodine,i hated the course and the way the professor interacted with the students i think she needs some people skills
11886,Jane  Nodine,i adore ms nodine you earn whatever grade you get in her class and if you are really trying you will be proud of what you create her she is always willing to help be afraid to ask i know she can seem a little intimidating at times but look past that to one of the best professors and artist in the state
11887,Jane  Nodine,i would tell you to avoid her at all costs but if your major is art thats impossible just keep your contact down because she is a person who will treat you bad and then make you start to believe you do something
11888,Jane  Nodine,the best professor in the art dept willing to help you if you ask is a difficult a but well worth the effort i learned a great deal in her class
11889,Jane  Nodine,the made me feel bad about myself times in one year but i think that just taught me to be more confident in myself so she helped me out in that manner i think she has one mind set its her way or the high way i dont let her bother me but i say i like her actaully i dislike her a lot
11890,Jane  Nodine,she likes to make you feel small and like you have no value i was thinking about seeking therapy after her course but i realized she just gets her jollies from making others feel bad i guess she is on a power trip maybe at home she beats her husband
11891,Jane  Nodine,thinks she is the queen and we should all bow to her i think she needs to retire or get a personality
11892,Jane  Nodine,at first i was afraid to take her class because of her reputation but she actually what all i had expected she has high expectations for your art work but only to improve you not criticize you and make you feel like crap she is open to
11893,Jane  Nodine,nodine is was she is if you are willing to advance yourself she is willing to help you do it she loves what she does and does what she loves keep a pocket dictionary as she prides herself on a sophisticated multifaceted vocabulary academics educati
11894,Jane  Nodine,no comments
11895,Jane  Nodine,very good at what she does
11896,Shounak  Das,dr das taught classes while waiting to get his residency to become a doctor he really new his material in human phys and made the class interesting he realized that students take more than one class at a time something most professors dont understand

11903,Lisa  Robson,victorian poetry is a great class that challenges you to think in new ways that expands your knowledge of the cent the assignments are very demanding and your are held up to a very high standard sometimes it feels as though what you write is never what robson wants which can be very
11904,Lisa  Robson,tough grader thought the class would be easy and work to improve my writing as not pursuing a degree in the humanities if serious about becoming a better i would highly recommend her nice person and seems passionate and knowledgeable take your essays seriously she is not impressed by stoned rambling
11905,Lisa  Robson,sort of a tough grader but she makes her expectations very clear and gives a lot of good feedback
11906,Lisa  Robson,lectures are always interesting and well organized likes class participation but it guarantee you a good grade tough marker but her suggestions will make you a better writer be prepared to put a lot of work into assignments if you want to do well topics come directly from class discussion so read the books and go to class
11907,Lisa  Robson,she expects a lot from students but you will learn more from her than any other english proff very helpful she loves what she does
11908,Lisa  Robson,this prof is archaic in that content and presentation need worka lot of work time to retire unless she could update her teaching style big time really big time take
11909,Lisa  Robson,hard marker that said pretty knowledgeable hard to know what she wants at times take for a first year class
11910,Lisa  Robson,her class is awful hardest marker ever had very boring lecture and disagree with her ideas when writing a paper get an f say reaching from the text avoid her class
11911,Lisa  Robson,time to retire i loove english but have been bored and sleeping due to lack of stimulating texts and content and way of getting the point across when will profs get with the program and be inventive learning will grow exponentially
11912,Lisa  Robson,pure evil gave me an f because not religious or a feminist easily the hardest marker ever encountered in university take her classes
11913,Lisa  Robson,wow amazing lecturer but horribly hard marker she seems receptive to new and different ideas but even when a student has support to back up their claims if it the same as hers you will do badly be careful when taking one of her classes be prepped for a lot of work and not so great of mark in the end
11914,Lisa  Robson,a good teacher willing to help she is crazy when it comes to marking i think she forgot it was a frist year class marked way too hard would be great for a or year class
11915,Lisa  Robson,tip write down everything she says except for those topics that she repeats over and over just put a star beside it i know its a little geeky but you probably should reread your notes and rewrite them to fully understand hard marker be sucessful if you agree wuth her
11916,Lisa  Robson,horrible annoying to listen to and picks favorites very hard to get a good mark in her tests even if u have asked her for help and she does still do bad not recommended
11917,Lisa  Robson,last class she said sure times emphasizes words to the point where you even stand to listen to her talk emphasizes soo annoying
11918,Lisa  Robson,evil woman only gives you an a if you pretend you agree with her agenda
11919,Lisa  Robson,fair marker clear lectures helpful comments profeminist theory male if a real english student like her
11920,Lisa  Robson,a horrible prof to take english with gives bad marks and dumb essay questions
11921,Lisa  Robson,she marks fairly and her classes are interesting good prof
11922,Lisa  Robson,great lectures but she marks hard not too bad

11946,Kairul  Lukman,screwed some pple with grade in end but he doesnt show up too often and a nice guy just make sure on his good side and do whatever meager work he tells youwell
11947,Blake  Sorem,this class was really easy everything that was on the exam was somewhere in his lecture notes that he has for you on canvas if you read those and do the assignments then you should be fine
11948,Blake  Sorem,not a whole lot of formal teaching there were some lecture notes but not every week but the textbook he uses is very informational and easy to understand so teaching myself that much of a problem lots of extra credit opportunities would take again would recommend to those who mind sort of teaching themselves
11949,Blake  Sorem,great lectures homework assigned helps with studying for tests practice quizzes were similar to tests he responds to emails within the same day
11950,Blake  Sorem,say goodbye to your gpa after this class did all the extra credit and assignments early yet the quizzes match up to the exams so i bombed them
11951,Blake  Sorem,best teacher had at pierce in my two years here so far i highly recommend taking his class if you get an opportunity very clear grading with very manageable work loads he always sets dates and lets you know what is due when and how to do it gives answers on all homework lots of extra credit opportunities i ended the class with over
11952,Blake  Sorem,spoken with a few other students and we have all had similar problems this past quarter the practices for exams are nothing like the actual exams and the questions on homework can be extremely confusing really post much in the class or answer messages in a timely manner no notes allowed even though you must memorize a lot
11953,Blake  Sorem,one of the easiest and best classes ever taken homework was a breeze but exams require a little more work textbook is free online lots of extra credit he raised my to a amazing
11954,Blake  Sorem,this economics class was a solid choice for the most part his online readings were very clear and had good insights into economics however he makes you do at least one exam inperson at the testing center his two online exams were all multiple choice except for a few calculations his inperson exam was all short answer and was quite harder
11955,Blake  Sorem,this professor was awesome he gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit way more than any other professor i have had really hard to fail this class he drops the lowest of exams which means if you like your grade no final homework and discussions you get full points for just for turning it in on time there are no surprises
11956,Blake  Sorem,give grade with no rules you will not understand were your lost the point and he will gives low grade to who has controverisal to him unfair and you will not get time to make up your assignment if you missed homework even you have any reaosn too much detailed things that you mighy missed be careful to choose
11957,Blake  Sorem,i enjoyed teaching style and clear cut expectations he actually reads your posts and provides you with specific feedback i would take him in a heartbeat who knew i would love econ thanks prof
11958,Blake  Sorem,lectures and examples are so clear i was able to easily get an a in this class always opportunity for extra credit and passionate when lecturing the class so much insight
11959,Blake  Sorem,easy class a good and nice professor and very very easy class can find most of the answers via internet and assignments are clear cut
11960,Blake  Sorem,amazing professor class was easy to follow took it online and he included lectures every week to go along with the reading usually his lectures helped so much i have to read the book easy to get in contact with super helpful and responds quickly
11961,Blake  Sorem,great teacher took this class to see i would like to go into business hes a great guy long lectures and easy homework once a week i missed a few but he gives out alot of extra credit options
11962,Blake  Sorem,awesome professor who made economics lectures interesting i was wellprepared for exams and all information tested on was covered during class lectures in detail
11963,Blake  Sorem,it is pretty easy to get an a out of this class as long as you finish the assignment and put effort on the test
11964,Blake  Sorem,mr sorem is by far my favorite instructor at pierce he is very helpful and clear as to what his expectations are you do have to work for your grade but he gives you all the tools needed to be successful in his class i would recommend his class to anyone who is a serious student and ready for a great educational experience
11965,Blake  Sorem,i thoroughly enjoyed my econ class with sorem very knowledgeable about his subject and goes into great detail about what he wants you to learn and take out of his lectures emphasize what he wants you to get out of his learning and the parts you need to focus on
11966,Blake  Sorem,had sorem for micro macro and have to say that macro with him was much easier than micro he goes through the process of graphs with supply demand rather quickly so you need to be paying attention or fall behind macro was much easier and a lot of fun with him he definitely knows his stuff and keeps the class fun and interesting
11967,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is a very nice guy outside of class but two or three times he singled out students during lecture seemingly for the sole purpose of assuming they had made a stupid mistake for the sake of discussion his organization was poor and i think he has somehow gained a monopoly over this course others could teach it far better
11968,Jerry  Johnson,been years since i took calc with this professor and i still avoid him on campus never has a professor made me feel so low and stupid and i even think he knew my name i used to love row student now
11969,Jerry  Johnson,i spent a year and a half getting to know math again and was just starting to learn it love it breathe it after this class i almost never want to see another math equation all love for the subject was nearly obliterated great guy but ruined my confidence in my math abilities completely
11970,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is an excellent professor i have had fairly poor experience with math instructors here at western but jerry made the class very enjoyable he is a great man and cares about each student he learns name and tries to get to know you personally take a class with jerry you regret it
11971,Jerry  Johnson,he is unlike any other math professor this class had many challenging concepts but he was always insistent on making it fun ie to learn about hyperbolic geometry he brought in pringles he learns your name quickly and is always very personable if you have to take a hard math class take it from him
11972,Jerry  Johnson,jerry as he insists on being called is an excellent teacher and a great man he really cares for his students and has a fun time getting to know them and teaching them holds plenty of review sessions for tests and will do whatever it takes to get you to pass as long as you try sometimes not crystal clear but he will explain if asked
11973,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is awesome he really cares about each on of his students his lectures are interesting and informative i found myself actually looking forward to attending i think was possible in a math class that being said his test are not easy if you are gonna skip class and not do the homework take calc with jerry
11974,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is an amazing teacher super helpful and involves everybody in the class super easy to talk to in office hours and out he takes time to learn about each one of his students his class is so much fun hilarious make you like math more than you did previously guaranteed
11975,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is an amazing teacher super helpful and involves everybody in the class super easy to talk to in office hours and out he takes time to learn about each one of his students his class is so much fun hilarious make you like math more than you did previously guaranteed
11976,Jerry  Johnson,very interactive
11977,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is the greatest math teacher ever had super enthusiastic and really cares about how you do in his class always willing to help and goes above and beyond to help students feel important the class does require a lot of time but if you pay attention do just fine just amazing
11978,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is an amazing teacher he has the passion needed to teach difficult concepts jerry is always available for extra help and is very approachable everyone should try to take at least one class from jerry while at western
11979,Jerry  Johnson,mr johnson is the best teacher i have had at wwu i had him for also and he made a class that may seem boring and difficult actually kind of fun his enthusiasm and willingness to help are contagious and he knows everything to know about math
11980,Jerry  Johnson,he was one of the smartest math teachers i had i took calc previously and the stuff i understand he would help me his tests are just like they say they are so pay attention also he is very classvolunteer oriented to make sure that everyone understands
11981,Jerry  Johnson,this is one of the best math classes i have ever taken jerry is very smart and passionate about math he makes some bad jokes but other than that he is a very good teacher i would recommend him for every math class you can take with him
11982,Jerry  Johnson,this was the worst math class i have ever taken i know some would strongly disagree but heasr me out after taking calculus in high school from a fantastic teacher i entered this class with the feeling that it be too difficult granite i am a freshman and this was my first quarter in college i did not expect it to be that bad i was
11983,Jerry  Johnson,this man is truly a nerd among nerds but also a fantastic math teacher if you like silly math riddles this class is for you he loves to put tricky questions on the tests and there is a problem of the week which is basically a mathriddle that he wants to share with you altogether not bad keep an eye out for tricks and you should be ok
11984,Jerry  Johnson,samert funny will help for sure awesome
11985,Jerry  Johnson,do not take this class from jerry unless you really really love math jerry makes the tests much harder and longer than they need to be his final took many students hours to complete is this legal his lectures and hw assignments are pretty good miss his lectures or you will be bitten i wish i had not taken this class from him
11986,Jerry  Johnson,jerry is the man definitely my favorite math teacher had at wwu
11987,Gregory Neil  Kawchuk,took this class a few years ago but still remembered the effort he put into teaching us was very organized had excellent notes gave us stories and tips to remember important information made a hard class fun

12009,Arlan  Schultz,he was awesome just come to class and you will do fine the only reason a person would give him a bad grade is because they understand english or come to class he was helpful fun and patience and very reasonable hell i wish my wife ha

12015,Roseanne  Mirabella,she is awesome read the readings participate a little and do fine she is so chill her discussions are awesome even though we always get off topic i really loved this core class with her she is a bit flakey and is late to most things but still awesome
12016,Roseanne  Mirabella,she is awesome if you do your work and come to class you will do fine she truly cares about her students seton hall needs more professors like her listen to the person who said awful because they are the type that probably didnt do the work and still expected an a
12017,Roseanne  Mirabella,awful
12018,Roseanne  Mirabella,if you do the work get an a her class discussions were pretty depressing and it was sometimes hard to know what she wanted in an assignment but overall it was an enjoyable class
12019,Roseanne  Mirabella,prof m worked with me in and i enjoyed her approach to the above noted class
12020,Roseanne  Mirabella,she is very willing to help you if you done well on your tests if she sees you doing what your supposed to she is libral and since she is a very important person on campus has a lot of info to share if your a dem you will like her.if your a repub welldiscussion will rise its a fun class

12024,Roseanne  Mirabella,whatever is written here is wrong these kids are trying to get you to take a hard class no kidding its soo hard tests are impossible and there is soo much homework dont take her
12025,Roseanne  Mirabella,very nice person helpful and funny easy grader especially during the summer session
12026,Roseanne  Mirabella,excellent professor
12027,Kathy  Moore,professor moore is the best math teacher ever had horrible at math and i struggled in this class but she helped me so much and never allowed me to give up she truly motivates you to want to do well and gives a lot of positive reenforcement tests are all cumulative which is tough but there are plenty of review sessions take her
12028,Kathy  Moore,kathy moore is the best math teacher i have ever had if you can get in her class do so she makes mathematics interesting and her passion for math makes her class fun she is very helpful and will explain how to do the problems in very clear simple ways her classes are the only time enjoyed math
12029,Kathy  Moore,professor moore was amazing makes math super easy and explains everything very well you do not need a textbook so you will save a ton of money i strongly suggest her
12030,Kathy  Moore,prof moore was the best math teacher ive ever had im not good at math at all and she actually helped me understand all of the material i recommend her shes so passionate about her job
12031,Kathy  Moore,i really enjoyed having this teacher i loved doing all the homework online the due dates are clear extra credit is literally on most paper assignments extremely nice and has many ways to help when confused herself office hours and email si leader youtube links for help a lot of work but not redundant busy work
12032,Kathy  Moore,great teacher but i felt this class was designed more for fulltime students hour lectures twice a week fairly grueling online homework and online quizzes and tests almost every friday and saturday i would not recommend if you work especially fulltime loved the online platform mom but could not handle the overall time commitment
12033,Kathy  Moore,an absolute sweetheart and very clear she will help you if you get stuck on homework actually a dog trainer which is pretty rad her homework is mostly online with some paperwork sometimes print out the book it will help believe me be afraid to ask a lot of questions
12034,Kathy  Moore,mrs moore is so helpful that at almost every opportunity there is a chance for extra credit shes helpful and like in any class do the homework thats the only way to pass she makes time available to help via office hours and through email and she has an si leader help the class definitely gave me an opportunity to be happy with math again
12035,Kathy  Moore,i will be honest i am horrible at math she teaches half lecture and the rest online you must get them right or you receive credit have a question regarding the homework she only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only because all have time for get ready for a ton of homework tough
12036,Kathy  Moore,kathy is well aware most people dislike math and as a result makes great efforts to make this class as painless as possible no textbook purchases are required too which is a huge bonus highly recommended
12037,Kathy  Moore,this teacher is very friendly but the tests are extremely hard and she gives quizzes every single day in the last minutes of class which i found very frustrating especially at the end of the day after a hour lecture
12038,Kathy  Moore,i lover professor moore prior to enrolling in math i had no idea how to do a lot of things and my precal class i took in hs made my confidence lower about my math skills very enthusiastic and not boring at all i learned soo much and she gives out a lot of extra credit i definitely recommend her if you are not lazy
12039,Kathy  Moore,moore is a pretty decent teacher she helps and gives a lot of example during class if confused her test are a bit of a struggle and the homework and quizzes are all online she does five of a ton of extra credit but make sure you wait till the last minute all in all she too bad horrible at math and she helped me pass
12040,Kathy  Moore,shes a very friendly woman but she classifies herself as an auditory learner so most of her material is online and her lectures are mostly her speaking not a lot of examples no book no actual homework to turn it all online and on very vague notes would not recommend her at all if math an easy subject for you
12041,Kathy  Moore,although she is a very friendly person and tries her hardest she makes mistakes in every lecture which only confuses the students she wants her students to do well but it felt like we were learning the course with her and not being taught the course i do not recommend this professor
12042,Kathy  Moore,professor moore is a very friendly professor however her lectures are very unclear she makes a lot of mistakes during lecture and although she corrects herself it gets confusing her tests are extremely hard and there was a quiz everyday
12043,Kathy  Moore,she is very dedicated to helping other and will meet you after class if she has time very friendly
12044,Kathy  Moore,a math expert with a positive attitude very informative and willing to stay after class to help students be in class everyday for her lectures because she makes the lessons simple to understand than reading over the textbook the class can be a challenge with number of quizzes and homework to complete but tests are the killers so study daily
12045,Kathy  Moore,super nerdy but super sweet
12046,Kathy  Moore,i was having a hard time with math but she really heped me understand she dedicates extra time to those students who are having a hard time
12047,Marilyn  Knight,took dr knight for creative writing and was very pleased the woman is absolutely hilarious she was a nurse and a police officer before she was a professor so her stories go from real quick you write original pieces in various genres and done would recommend
12048,Marilyn  Knight,she was an amazing professor lectures go by very fast and almost all of the time you are out of class minutes early she got to know all of her students would definitely recommend her
12049,Marilyn  Knight,no tests are given all you have to do is write the papers she truly cares about her students and learns each students name works with you on anything you need help with makes class go by fast
12050,Marilyn  Knight,i took her just for an arthumanities and since i like to write i thought this was perfect in this class we all sat in a circle had group discussions critiqued each other and she gave awesome feedback very open and laid back plus hilarious and sweet
12051,Marilyn  Knight,she is a pretty good professor she is very helpful and cancels class a lot when she does have class you mostly sit around and talk because she is very laid back
12052,Marilyn  Knight,i think she was genderdiscriminate but rather had favorites class was fine though she was extremely critical best advicetake her lower levels first to get some favoritism before this class otherwise its an uphill battle from the start
12053,Marilyn  Knight,like men beware
12054,Marilyn  Knight,a great teacher i loved her class she tells great life stories if you can take her for anything do
12055,Marilyn  Knight,i really know who could find her helpful or challenging at all my lit ap teacher in high school challenged me more you spend less than minutes talking about a story write like paper and then waste the rest of the time talking about nothing class for an easy a and lazy people
12056,Marilyn  Knight,she is very helpful all you have to do is just talk to her she is very understanding but try not to miss her class
12057,Marilyn  Knight,i have taken a few of her classes i also chose her as my senior seminar coach she was very nice and helpful as a teachershe is a jem she was always excited about the content and she made us feel the same way
12058,Marilyn  Knight,this woman is the reason i finish college wish they were all like her
12059,Marilyn  Knight,she is a very openminded professor this class is an easy a a few papers here and there but she is always available to help if you are unable to do something or maybe just having a diffucult time she will work with you
12060,Marilyn  Knight,she is so wonderful she helped me so much and i owe alot of my to her class
12061,Marilyn  Knight,i had her for more than or classes she changed my life thank you dr knight if you ever read this my name is donovan and everyone should know how great she and the entire english department at uscs truly is thank you so much
12062,Marilyn  Knight,she is an awesome teacher very easy you have to write a couple of essays half of the class if going to be watching movies and your final project is going to be an essay on a meaningful song she is a great teacher awesome
12063,Marilyn  Knight,a wondeful lady with a sense of humor very down to earth and her class is a breeze do take her if u have the opp she is a breath of fresh air at uscs
12064,Marilyn  Knight,one of the best teachers i have ever had one of the most fun too
12065,Marilyn  Knight,such an amazing and wonderful lady i learned so much in her class and miss a day or wish to miss a day ever teachers and classes like hers is what college is all about i want to take her as much as i can and not even an english major wonderful person makes you think a must
12066,Marilyn  Knight,please take she is wonderful very in tune with collge students and what interests them i took her twice love her
12067,Charisse  Willis,she will make you wait outside the classroom if you are late for even a minute if the assignment is pages she wants full pages no more and no less this is a vigorous course cuz you hav to work in groups its already tough for people like me who prefer solo but its whatevs getting an a dont think so gettin that a is impossible
12068,Charisse  Willis,dean willis is so inspirational and will be missed at sju i learned life lessons in her class and it helped me learn what life will be like when i am a teacher she brought guest speakers in to keep us up to date with the many changes ny has in the doe great class definitely take if you have the chance to
12069,Charisse  Willis,thee most toughest course you will ever take this is coming from someone who is an ed major this is a course where you actually learn and not be lazy this professor is obsessed with the friendships the critical issue for this course is that there is a lack of time hours per class would be perfect i love this class why must she retire
12070,Charisse  Willis,she is a great prof im a transfer i have to say my other school edu wise was much better until i took dean willis class theres a lot of group work but thats preparation for us as future teachers we are going to make a community with others so we need to start now i hope she doesnt leave shes the most helpful person in school of edu undergrad
12071,Charisse  Willis,the fact that dean willis can put up with me proves she is a worthy professor saying that helpful is an understatement yes all the work is done independently but we need the class time for stuff to prepare us future educators i dont see her class as a form of advertising but more of an informative class deanwillisfan ty for this experience
12072,Charisse  Willis,dean willis wants people to get to know each other because it is important to know your students whomever wrote the comment before should not be a teacher at all take advantage of what you learn and teach it and look to hurt someone who truly cares about her students she is an amazing person and i am so sad she is leaving sju
12073,Charisse  Willis,amazing simply simply amazing woman
12074,Charisse  Willis,by far the best professor dean and person at st johns never learned so much in a class she keeps it real with you and gives you whats expected in the real world for once in my life i would be upset when class was canceled please take her for or and easy a none the less
12075,Charisse  Willis,dean willis can get annoying act tough and get all in your face but her class is fun learn so much honestly her was the best class i have ever taken she keeps it real and tells you everything you need to know no textbook or tests mostly class presentations and papers final is bringing diner from home take the class
12076,Charisse  Willis,easy class the midterm is the hardest part and she or her assistant give you all the answers the class before i also took her for human relations amusing and a great person easy pass or a
12077,Charisse  Willis,prof willis is a true class act and the consumate professional she is an asset to sju she sheppards many young teachers through the process in a great way she has my absolute respect and regard
12078,Charisse  Willis,haters stop hating charisse is probably the most real you will ever confront in your lives she is wellrounded and does all she can to relay her knowledge to her students if you let down your guards and allow her to teach you you might actually learn something about yourselves as an individual you earn your grade
12079,Charisse  Willis,bottom line charisse is a great women her classes are fun but intense you will learn alot
12080,Charisse  Willis,absolutely love her she is so down to earth and will tell you like it is which some people need gives a few simple assignments and is there whenever you need her had her for this class and orientation to edu and i will take her any chance i get
12081,Charisse  Willis,once again the bestprofessor ever this women is an amazing professor who gets her students involved so much in class that you sometimes dont even realize ur learning something i would definitly say that you need to take her classes because its well worth it definitly ganna be keepin in touch with her because she is such a great help
12082,Charisse  Willis,just amazing
12083,Charisse  Willis,easy class we just hung out really she gives random assignments but easy make sure you do well on your group presentation though really cool and a great dean get to know her because willing to help you out with anything
12084,Charisse  Willis,amazing amazing amazing teacher and dean she goes out of her way to please all her students take her if you can
12085,Charisse  Willis,she is simply amazing
12086,Charisse  Willis,she is one of the best teachers i have ever had she is amazing
12087,Ronald  Martin,he sucks.he never lectures he takes attendance and dismisses us i get why i paid for this class if he never teaches us anything pissed this will lower my gpa for sure.i need to talk to a dean.we go to class take attendance says he forgot his lecture slides or repeats a lesson and then we go home an hour mad horrible teacher
12088,Ronald  Martin,dr martin is the best yet hardest professor i ever took in my years at sac i took him for two courses in the mid he is a great lecturer and a fair test giver his exam essay questions are but not unfairly so if you love history if you can read comprehensively and analytically and if you can write well take dr martin
12089,Ronald  Martin,this was by far the hardest class i took for my first semester of college mr martin is a great guy as a person but he expects way too much his exams are all essays and he expects you to know every little detail if ok with getting a c or lower take his class if not run
12090,Ronald  Martin,if just trying to get units for your general ed this is not for you quizzes are given almost every class session and he is a very hard grader on essays give you essay questions to study before the exam pick four of the essay questions and then you only answer you you basically waste your time studying extra essay questions
12091,Ronald  Martin,do not take this class there is a reason he has over ratings this is my first time rating a teacher because i need to vent not a teacher you take pages of notes almost every class that he reads word for word off a slides show he is very slow gpa killer test are all essay question in which he grades very hard boring
12092,Ronald  Martin,majority of grade based on essays
12093,Ronald  Martin,do not take his class his lectures are to mixed and he goes to fast to take any notes his assistant was not my favorite to say in the nicest way the final is essays and descriptions of people or places i would advise that you pick another teacher i mean look at his ratings nice guy but not a good teacher
12094,Ronald  Martin,great professor easy reading quizzes and essays you do not have to be a good writer or be smart you just need to read those who read got a bad grade those who did got a great grade if you go to sac there be an easier history teacher just read for the quizes and study for the exams and be good
12095,Ronald  Martin,he was an ok professor you have to do the reading for the quizzes and you have to be a good writer for the exams but if you pay attention and do the reading it really all that hard i got a he does like to hear himself talk though
12096,Ronald  Martin,dr martin is a great history professor if you do the work required and take responsibility for your own grade you will like him if you do those things you like him
12097,Ronald  Martin,professor is useless his t.a test r essays which in my opinion are b.s he grades on his oponion not the facts tests are all from his lectures and power points which are horrible he forgets what talking about half the time and relies on is assistant
12098,Ronald  Martin,his tests are based on his lectures not the textbook he let you record lectures his grading is harsh end up working thrice as hard as you would for another history class so unless in love with history and are a part time student take his class your gpa will suffer i got a b and i worked harder on this than math
12099,Ronald  Martin,a great professor but getting an a is rare if interested in history and do well in it i recommend taking him he lectures well and boring but if you hate history and just trying to get by your gen ed his grading will affect your gpa he grade unfairly he just grades hard a difference
12100,Ronald  Martin,horrible professor forgets what he is about to say extremely hard expects you to remember every single detail do not take history with him
12101,Ronald  Martin,gpa terminator want to find out what that means sign up for his class
12102,Ronald  Martin,he will waste your time or lower your gpa avoid this teacher do not take
12103,Ronald  Martin,yes this class is as hard as everyone is stating i recommend this class for anyone that is a history major if you love history take this class if you like history like i overall he is a really really nice guy as a professor he is not the best
12104,Ronald  Martin,took his class a while ago at scc he expects you learn everything and when you try your hardest for the bewolf essay he will give you a low grade
12105,Ronald  Martin,unfair teacher expects you to know every exact detail that happened in history do not take if you are not a history person
12106,Ronald  Martin,ok professor not all of us are willing to dedicated our life to history hard test boring lecture tend to get loud just try to avoid if you care for your gpa
12107,Terri  Searfos,she is an ok teacher but i think she is bipolar she is happy one minute and then the next thing you know she is screaming down your throat mess up whatever you do she is now teaching at columbus state though
12108,Terri  Searfos,a really hard teacher you definitely slack in her class her tests are really really hard so watch out
12109,Lisa  Shearer,i like lisa a lot she is such a wonderful person
12110,Lisa  Shearer,no comments
12111,Lisa  Shearer,has lots of experience.very approachable in this field we need a caring side for patients and not just porfessor side they both work together she has it
12112,Jim  Walker,i came to iu thinking i wanted to pursue an econ degree this class made me certain of it great at explaining theory of models indepth exams are not bad as long as you study and exams always have extra credit question that make the average at least an a friendly guy whose lectures i eventually looked forward to
12113,Jim  Walker,prof walker is the best professor had here at iu always willing to help you understand the material and is committed to student success grades tests and returns them within hours while this class requires good calculus knowledge he makes all the calculus applications super accessible i would love to take this course again
12114,Jim  Walker,everyone was telling me how hard intermediate micro is but it really too bad if you go to class prof walker only tests on the material he teaches in class and assigns in homework just go take good notes and study a tiny bit and youll be fine walker passes more students than any of the other econ professors so take with him
12115,Jim  Walker,best instructor i have had in my four years at iu very knowledgeable and clear communicator
12116,Jim  Walker,terrific teacher in every facet he has perfected the teaching of e321
12117,Jim  Walker,good professor and a cool guy super helpful to go to office hours his exams really test your understanding expected to do everything he shows in class backwards and upside down regardless of whether or not he does it in class for you
12118,Jim  Walker,probably knowledgeable about econ but really bad at teaching it his lectures are not organized at all so the main idea is usually lost on avoid him if you can
12119,Jim  Walker,he is not very good at explaining things but the workbook is very clear so all you need i pay attention hardly at all but do fine as long as you study a lot before the tests if going to take this class take the honors version with him
12120,Jim  Walker,one of the best econ profs you can get if you are able to take the honors course do it with walker easier than regular course not a lot of hw he prepares you well for his tests and go to cl helpful
12121,Jim  Walker,very good teacher professor walker is extremely knowledgeable on the subject he makes you feel free to ask questions and offers clear explanations with that said the material is fairly tough mc questions on tests can be tricky overall i got a good grade but i have never studied that hard for tests in my life still a great teacher
12122,Jim  Walker,professor walker is awesome he gives good explanations and examples and he seems enthusiastic at every class before class he played classic rock music attendance is important and this class requires work but if you put in the proper amount of time you will do well in his class
12123,Jim  Walker,if you go to every class and cl you will get a at least
12124,Jim  Walker,prof walker is a good teacher i feel like really hard to understand what he is actually trying to say most of the time though however if you read the book and actually study and try to understand vs memorize the material you will be fine if you put effort into the class get an bc the tests extremely hard conceptually
12125,Jim  Walker,walker is the way to go for econ clear explanations and his tests are much more straightforward than self or olsen who love to throw in trick questions i had econ prior to taking this class and thought he made it pretty interesting go to cl do the workbook questions and do well
12126,Jim  Walker,great teacher funny guy and his workbook helps so much everyone who takes olsen regrets it take walker not olsen great class and pretty easy to get a good grade if you put in the time doing practice problems and practice tests in his workbook
12127,Jim  Walker,everyone seems to give him good ratings but in my experience he been especially helpful or clear he obviously knows what talking about but moves too quickly and seems to be at teaching such a large class if you work hard in his class do well but expect him to be as awesome as everyone says he is
12128,Jim  Walker,i really hated econ in high school but professor walker was much better at explaining it and i actually like the subject now i found the tests a little difficult but not too hard
12129,Jim  Walker,explains everything very well and makes it interesting gives you several extra credit opportunities
12130,Jim  Walker,professor walker is good at explaining the subject matter and very helpful he really wants his students to succeed i had to end up dropping the class because it was just too much with too many credit hours but if i were to try econ again i would definitely try to get walker he makes economics interesting and also friendly and funny
12131,Jim  Walker,do not buy the parkin book you will never use it do do the homework on a regular basis and do go to cl it all really helps
12132,Martin  Frey,great for new law students not for the faint of heart as the issues are esoteric in volume and really no time to fool around prof frey really cares about his students and those who study law he is what he is a nononsense professor who there for fun and games but one who is there to bash kx into your mind
12133,Martin  Frey,the best teaching professor at tu law take secured transactions with prof frey
12134,Martin  Frey,been awhile since law school but i thought professor frey was great he was my all time favorite law professor he was always available and willing to answer questions he really cares about his students and wants them to succeed marty rocks
12135,Martin  Frey,strong knowledge and approach although grades hard good professor to introduce new law students into the study of law not to mention contracts
12136,Martin  Frey,a lot of bashing here bet not from anyone who has practiced prof frey does a terrific job of preparing his students to practice law which is what the majority of his class is there for his contract theory served me well on the bar exam and in the eight years since tough yes but excellent
12137,Martin  Frey,i am now stupider for having taken this class i imagine why schools keep hiring him learn everything yourself but make sure to learn it his way impossible exam hours closed book essay questions about a million issues i would fake an allergy to oklahomans and transfer out asap
12138,Martin  Frey,paradigm paradigm paradigm paradigm google me and you get returns for no breach excuse and all linked to me paradigm paradigm paradigm rhetorical question issues in a hour test
12139,Martin  Frey,i am still painfully lost after this class i feel like i learned nothing compared to my other classes even civpro was better avoid at all costs if the school has went and renewed his kx know his paradigm useless as it is
12140,Martin  Frey,the most painful experience in law school offer acceptance go through your paradigm
12141,Martin  Frey,there is no offer or preliminary negotiation here marty stinks straight up and is rather arrogant to boot
12142,Martin  Frey,probably the worst class i had all year completely unclear the paradigm was totally unhelpful yikes hopefully our school will never have him visit again
12143,Martin  Frey,this guy is a joke he was a visiting professor at my school in the spring of he had the opportunity to teach at a major law school and really messed it up unfortunately i learned nothing from him tulsa you deserve him lol
12144,Deborah  Miller,best professor ever had i want to be her when i grow up
12145,Deborah  Miller,an unforgiving grader take anything late it could be seconds late but it might as well have been days late she take it she may be good at english but she really know how to teach it always spend class time wisely may act like she care about the students but she really
12146,Deborah  Miller,she was rude and arrogant and cared way too much about the lart program she scoffed at anyone who had a differing opinion about that class the information was pointless yet we did so much work
12147,Deborah  Miller,she was brilliantly insightful and went out of her way to make her students feel valuable a difficult class yes but untimely useful for future classes
12148,Deborah  Miller,this professor is very helpful and teaches about very relevant material she expects a lot from students but all worth it i learned a lot and would definitely take her class again
12149,Deborah  Miller,as a person i like her a lot i also like her as a teacher i think she teaches very well personally however she is very unforgiving she accepts nothing late and is a very harsh grader be wary when you join her class if you good at getting things in on time but if you are she is a very good teacher and person
12150,Deborah  Miller,alright
12151,Deborah  Miller,difficult but she cares about her students if they care incredibly clear and wellspoken and been to her house for dinner and an excellent cook
12152,Deborah  Miller,hated this class
12153,Deborah  Miller,she is very smart but definately arrogant she expected a lot but we are college students the one problem i had with her is after she read our papers her comments were very harsh and she made me feel so judged no matter what i was writing about
12154,Deborah  Miller,i hated going to that class she expected way too much had no mercy and her comments were harsh she seemed to be intelligent but to the point of arrogance and i hardly ever understand what she was talking about in class glad that class is over
12155,Deborah  Miller,i thought that her poetry class was really fantasticshe really pushed us to do our best work and taught me a lot about understanding and writing poetry
12156,Deborah  Miller,an informative and invested teacher
12157,Deborah  Miller,this class includes a lot of writing
12158,Deborah  Miller,terrible professor out of students only actually liked her tough to get all your points on her assignments she requires students to write on the level that she does if signed up for her get out immediately first semester i had a b in english and then i took her class second semester and got a d now i have to redo the class
12159,Deborah  Miller,she knows writing but not how to teach it i think her new personal life is getting in the way of her job and she is not able to successfully teach her class everyone talked to about it her class because her grading is ridiculous and she is sometimes unorganized and unprepared she loses some of your assignments as wellno mercy
12160,Deborah  Miller,she exudes grace even in the midst of difficulty she will stretch and challenge us but the outcome will be worth it hse is a class act who knows her stuff
12161,Deborah  Miller,prof miller is a very intelligent professor she really knows and has a passion for what she does she also hopes that her students will become engaged and at least somewhat enjoy what they do very helpful and although she expects a lot from her students we are afterall in college we you learn a lot from her
12162,Deborah  Miller,has basically a mail order mfa from spaulding university you go there a few times and do correspondence work and they hand you your diploma her teaching reflects how little she actually knows about poetry and her lack of a decent publication record reinforces it one day maybe au will hire a real poet but i doubt it sincerely
12163,Deborah  Miller,no way jack avoid at all costs
12164,Pat  Cyrgalis,gives as little information as possible and if you ask for clarification shame on you i get the impression she thinks being a secretary is a high level position makes me wonder if she has an education if not she may want to consider taking a communication class
12165,Pat  Cyrgalis,very unwilling to help and when she did answer a question it was never the correct answer she sets you up to fail
12166,Pat  Cyrgalis,what a waste of skin talk to anyone but her cannot give answers to the simplest direct questions.does not want to help
12167,Pat  Cyrgalis,just a very rude person why mrs greig fire her and find a better representation of the nursing program is beyond me sure good at what she does but there are many people out there that could do just as well with a better attitude
12168,Pat  Cyrgalis,could not have been less helpful if her job description read completely ignore students or make them wish you had
12169,Pat  Cyrgalis,secretary
12170,Pat  Cyrgalis,i have an idea shake up a magic eight ball because it will give you more accurtate responses to your questions than she will and i agree with the rest the antichrist was more polite than her did i mention she lied to every question i would of chosen a different nearby nursing program if i knew this one was so messed up
12171,Pat  Cyrgalis,the most unfreiendly unhelpful person i have encountered why this women still maintains her employment is beyond me
12172,Pat  Cyrgalis,the most unhelpful secretary i have ever encountered
12173,Pat  Cyrgalis,get better answers talking to a wall
12174,Pat  Cyrgalis,not helpful and usually rude acts like she hates her job never gives you the time of day and always acts to busy to help you which i thought was her job she needs to find something where you dont deal with people
12175,Pat  Cyrgalis,she is the secretary for the nursing dept very hard to get along with very rude and short with you when asking questions does not call or email you back not helpful at all acts like she hates her job you get better answers calling director
12176,Tyra  Seldon,not exactly a gift to the english department those who know her best refer to her as tyra the tyrant
12177,Tyra  Seldon,very defensive personality she wants her students to have her opinion not their own
12178,Tyra  Seldon,mastered basice grammar and spelling herself unbelievable that she was hired unfair grading and very defensive personality avoid this professor
12179,Tyra  Seldon,if you write the same way she would expect a good grade just because you say something differently make what i said wrong she needs to realize she make the rules of english and their are other ways than her way
12180,Tyra  Seldon,i got all in english until i had her and got a c she and i just didnt mesh wise and she let that effect my gradeeven though i did everything i could to please her she was so rude
12181,Tyra  Seldon,think good at english is that what your last prof led you to believe dr seldon exists to prove you wrong that only path to an a is to mimmick her own writing as well as possible drop the class if you like yourself
12182,Tyra  Seldon,she use class time very well many canceled classes
12183,Tyra  Seldon,if you want help you have to go and ask for it if you are interested in improving your writing she is an excellent teacher if you just want an easy grade choose a different professor she also uses class time very effectively i have really enjoyed her
12184,Tyra  Seldon,not helpful to students really care about student concerns for the class dictator
12185,Tyra  Seldon,she is patronizing and blameshifting she does not respond well to criticism and did not seem entirely willing to work with students on problems
12186,Tyra  Seldon,no comments
12187,Tyra  Seldon,always available for help and has a real passion for what she is teaching
12188,Richard  Sambrook,the tests are really hard but it matter because he gives so many opportunities for extra credit his class is extremely boring take as itv class he rambles about stuff that is never on the test he talks like zoolander
12189,Richard  Sambrook,great teacher helps students achieve a good grade like teachers that like to fail you hes a good guy with a good heart good communicater also if you email him one day email you back with in the day all test except map test are online
12190,Richard  Sambrook,great teacher helps students achieve a good grade like teachers that like to fail you hes a good guy with a good heart good communicater also if you email him one day email you back with in the day all test except map test are online
12191,Richard  Sambrook,horrible a very nice person but he tends to ramble and lecture about things that on the test then the tests are about things that never even heard of half of the class failed every single one the labs are ridiculous and half the time he even know how to do them

12249,Owen  Mertens,owen is fantastic i hate math and he made me understand it he is so helpful and he is a really cool guy funny and shares great stories
12250,Owen  Mertens,absolutely do not take unless you know everything about trig before entering this class goes over the most basic examples and expects you to automatically know how to do the more advanced problems when i said i remember anything from college algebra his answer was not my problem avoid
12251,Owen  Mertens,owen is fantastic he is a really nice guy and a great teacher if you have any trouble he is always available to his students i would love to take another one of his classes
12252,Owen  Mertens,he is laid back and makes the math very easy to understand
12253,Owen  Mertens,great teacher with a lot of passions and concern for students
12254,Owen  Mertens,he is really lax about getting grades into the computer
12255,Owen  Mertens,he was an absolute godsend i took this class with different professors and he explained better taught better and kept the pressure off better than i thought was possible a good reason his classes fill up fast
12256,Owen  Mertens,a cool guy and pretty laid back he explains the notes very clearly he will do anything he can to help miss class or you will get behind he gives can bring you up up a letter grade he gives somes extra credit the tests are somewhat hard if you go over the notes and his study guides they are fine
12257,Owen  Mertens,he is a little confusing i think he does things ont he board that even matter i would recommend going to class but he is really nice and helpful if you are having problems
12258,Owen  Mertens,not a good teacher for people who struggle with math
12259,Owen  Mertens,owen is a really fun guy just make sure you keep up with your homework and study for the tests and you will be in good shape
12260,Owen  Mertens,he made me understand and like math
12261,Owen  Mertens,do not take him if you are bad at math he is super nice and willing to help but he will do a problem on the board and then say dont do it that way he is a little confusing sometimes
12262,Owen  Mertens,great teacher the best math teacher i have ever had very laid back and willing to help you has a great sense of humor as well so he tries to make class enjoyable
12263,Owen  Mertens,take any class you can with him i got my first b in math since grade tests bad and his strict
12264,David  Lank,where you guys attending the same class as me he is one of the best teachers i have ever seen at mcgill his classes are interesting and he values what every student has to say in his classes they should clone this guy and replace many of the duds mcgill currently has in the management faculty
12265,David  Lank,a little surprised at the comments on here lank is a passionate dedicated thoroughly engaging prof i was impressed by the dedication he exhibited to his students he regularly spent minutes after class with me discussing issues that were only tangentially related to the course as ebert and roeper would say two thumbs way up
12266,David  Lank,avoid
12267,David  Lank,a business thoughts built in my mind i doubt it
12268,David  Lank,emotional scars might fade away that big fat f in my transcript
12269,David  Lank,not very impressive frankly speaking
12270,David  Lank,the blah blah style course should you want to learn something stay away
12271,David  Lank,the tuition should have had a better use i only remember his pageslong list of titles now
12272,David  Lank,want to take this course think again professor lank does not hesitate to give out or out of grades in exams and assignments even in group assignments do not think you cannot fail because it is business course
12273,David  Lank,absolutely find no worthiness this old gentleman try to tell you what is patent and shareholder agreement which better google cheaper better and faster do not expect any practical thing from his class he is apparently enjoys hisself in class
12274,David  Lank,great guy great class a little phony though
12275,David  Lank,this guy is amazing the best he is nearly yrs old but has twice the energy and euthasism than professors half his age his respect for students and love of teaching make all the other teachers in mcgill management look mediocre at best this guy should give a class to the mcgill professors on how to teach and motivate students
12276,David  Lank,the best prof ever
12277,David  Lank,amazing teacher a philosopher more than a business teacher
12278,David  Lank,great teacher good speakers but class objectives a little too vague
12279,David  Lank,if you have to take a class in mgmt this is it everything else is honestly hell david way to go if life was a cupcakes the frosting
12280,David  Lank,lank was the most amazing inspiring teacher ever had in my life i thought this class would be boring but it was so interesting lank really believes in his students and has this tangible excitment that makes you want to better the world yourself amazing prof
12281,David  Lank,consider yourself lucky if you have the priviledge of being in prof class it is rare to encounter a teacher who so genuinely cares for and believes in his students certainly more than just an entrepreneurship course prof eloquent lectures inspire you to do better
12282,David  Lank,there are few teachers that trully make a difference in lives prof lank is one of them he cares about his students has confidence in us he sees us as the future and believes we can all make a difference in the world his course is interesting provides great notes and great guest sp

12284,Andrea  Woody,very helpful in ta sections but not so much in lectures because difficult to be specific in philosophy with people in a room
12285,Andrea  Woody,professor woody explains concepts in more than one way so everyone can understand she is enthusiastic about the subject which makes lectures engaging the tas do most of the grading but she is there at her office hours for extra help or clarification this was by far my favorite class of the quarter
12286,Andrea  Woody,shes really awesome her lectures are very interesting the class overall was very interesting especially because shes into what she does
12287,Andrea  Woody,about this class turned out to be really interesting although readings are long interesting to read not a hard class reasonable amount of work do consider if in need of w credit about woody easy to see how passionate she is although she is slow at explaining concepts she is indeed knowledgeable her are amazing
12288,Andrea  Woody,dr woody genuinely cares if students are learning or not this class was so interesting and really broadened my interest not only in philosophy but also in the performing arts she also gives great essay feedback i feel lucky to have been able to learn with her and would highly recommend her to anyone who wants a teacher who genuinely cares
12289,Andrea  Woody,professor woody seemed very passionate about the subject and i had no doubts about her knowledge level she was enthusiastic and answered questions well during lecture she posted the slides online which was very helpful if you ever missed a class only thing i like was that lectures were very long and not much interaction with audience
12290,Andrea  Woody,woody is overall a great professor she always came well prepared her lectures were pretty interesting and she was eager to hear input she is definitely one of the few professors that really want her students to learn something and is very helpful i would highly recommend her
12291,Andrea  Woody,my favorite prof at uw wellprepared and enthusiastic for lectures and foster own thoughts a lot easygoing on hw deadlines and very helpful at office hours sets up online discussion boards and attend conversation frequently she would be perfect if it is easier to get a good grade on her courses
12292,Andrea  Woody,andrea woody is one of the best professors had super knowledgeable and teaches effectively even if intimidated by the sciences this class will give you interesting insights best of all she really cares about her students and philosophy of science go to office hours she is also a great mentor
12293,Andrea  Woody,excellent lecturer but i did sometimes fell a little lost the readings are only moderately hard but i recommend doing them if you want to get anything out of the class plus there is not too much grading was fair and she is incredible at office hours
12294,Andrea  Woody,intensive but very interesting i able to put as much effort into it as i wish i could have and a sign to me that a good class she certainly knows what she is talking about
12295,Andrea  Woody,interesting class but not one that a student with a nonscience background should take too much reading to complete in one quarter and nowhere near enough time for assignments
12296,Andrea  Woody,no comments
12297,Andrea  Woody,excellent lecturer she uses a lot of overheads making her lectures easy to follow she values student input and is very open to answering questions
12298,Andrea  Woody,great teacher but is tough

12304,Ching-Tsuan  Pan,c.t pan is a horrible teacher he does not care whether or not the students do well in the class he is impossible to understand not only in his speaking but also in his writing you might as well wear a blindfold to class and plug your ears
12305,Ching-Tsuan  Pan,good teacher makes u learn and think has an accent uses great vsual help
12306,Ching-Tsuan  Pan,he is the worst teacher at niu he doesnt speak english he doesnt even write in english you cant understand a word he says and when he write on the board its just scribbles if you get him your doomed to fail everyone in my class did

12315,James  Worley,he is an awesome professor
12316,James  Worley,i took intro to drama for what i thought would be an easy elective it was not i attended every class and would strongly recommend a different art credit i made an a in every class including biology and chemistry and i promise this class took more studying to pull off an a the history of rock in roll is the best way to go for an art credit

12385,Louvincy  Brown,she grades very hard test one was a slap in the face very tricky she expects you to read the chapters on your own and be ready for the test i advice you to not take her class
12386,Louvincy  Brown,dr brown as she says is a okay professor she is not all that hard read your book because she lectures from it like a pastor gives a sermon from the bible i care for her cockiness and she only gives you an a if she likes you all in all if you are up for her conceitedness she is alright but i tell you the attitude is a challenge
12387,Louvincy  Brown,i love speaking in front of people and crowds but once i got into her class she really tried to discourage me from being who i am i dont like the way she talks to people she is very sarcastic and cocky she likes to talk about herself alot and what she has done she doesnt care about other feelings or what she says to people very bias
12388,Louvincy  Brown,an easy a attend class do your work on time and participate
12389,Louvincy  Brown,no comment
12390,Louvincy  Brown,i have never received anything less than a c since kindergarden i love school and i love learning.i am currently taking a full hours worth of classes plus more and i still received anything less than a b she is a teacher that rates you on how much she likes you rather than your work and she needs to retire he time has came and went
12391,Louvincy  Brown,professor brown taught me during summer she is a wonderful instructor very enthusiastic and very fair in her grading a lot more understanding that people give her credit for
12392,Louvincy  Brown,be ready to give group ind presentations use correct english u should get an a
12393,Louvincy  Brown,all i can say is she is the best i will recommend everyone to take her class
12394,Louvincy  Brown,the best of the best very enthusiastic professor well spoken and knowledgeable on the subject a true inspiration to me she demands punctuality and participation is a must because she is active in her lectures
12395,Louvincy  Brown,mrs brown is very happy with life and her family and it shows through her personality she can be tough on grading but i found her to be fair showing interest in what you are doing and class participation will get you a passing grade who wants to pass a class without deserving it oh you have to study ask questions for clarification
12396,Louvincy  Brown,this teacher base her grading not on what u do in class but how much u kiss her but and since i kiss her but she gave me a f i did pass my test and speeches and still understand how i got a f stay away from this teacher if u have to take comm at another campus worth it
12397,Louvincy  Brown,she is full of energy and the class is quite easy but she is picky when it comes to speeches if you are not an kisser than you need to be sure that your paper is a plus material because if you suck up and you know that you did at least a b she will give you a b or a c
12398,Louvincy  Brown,no comments
12399,Louvincy  Brown,a very happy and thoughful teacher if you take her class she will make learning about communications interesting work with you to help you pass her class and a great person to talk to inside and out her class i will still keep in touch with her after her class
12400,Louvincy  Brown,mrs.brown is full of energy every always has a smile and she will help you as much as she can all you have to do is ask i like her and i enjoyed her class
12401,Louvincy  Brown,be stiff during the speeches bang on the table and get your point accross as if you are having a conversation with your friends but be proper the only way you will get an a in her class be stiff and boring and have some flavor and creativing writing in your speeches
12402,Tiny  Niiro,the best professor i have had in gettysburg so inspiring so clear so helpful
12403,Tiny  Niiro,worst teacher ever you cannot understand him unless you speak japanese and he is very mean
12404,Tiny  Niiro,i agree with the car accident guy
12405,Tiny  Niiro,this man is a sadist he will make you feel very very small.do not bother volunteering in class he will shoot you down real hard to the people above who said he has high clarity they must speak japanese because i undestand this guy
12406,Tiny  Niiro,probably the best prof i have had at gburg he is always willing to help and teaches the students in the most concrete way if you are an econ major definitely take one of his classes
12407,Tiny  Niiro,this man is a genius i have the utmost respect for him there are many very smart professors at gburg but this man blows them away its a very hard class but a fair grader he also takes the time to answer any of your questions anytime.niiro rocks
12408,Tiny  Niiro,he is a very intellectual man but also a tremendous nerd he really tries to humiliate his students in class which is definitely wrong
12409,Fernando  Coronil,i might have something to say about his teaching abilities if ever show up on time to anything prepare for class or teach the classes scheduled to teach
12410,Fernando  Coronil,brilliant and charismatic his passion is contagious and he really cares about the subject his students and the world great teacher
12411,Fernando  Coronil,liked to discus off the reading information showed lots of videos easy assignments all papers for the grade no blue books and very interesting
12412,Fernando  Coronil,very challenging professor he pushes students to think in creative ways unbelievably sexy too
12413,Fernando  Coronil,very difficult but very dedicated teacher
12414,Fernando  Coronil,no comments
12415,Glenna  Vanderhoof,she was very passionate about her teaching she always tell you what would be on her tests attendance sometimes is required in order to know what is going on in the class surrounding she is very kind and helpful not a lot of homework in her class though easy a
12416,Glenna  Vanderhoof,dr vanderhoof was a great person and was very fair on grading almost too easy both me and another person received in the class without even putting that much effort into it i do believe some of my class mates and i could have passed the test to be waived out of a computer class but it kept my gpa up and was a nice experience
12417,Glenna  Vanderhoof,great teacher very understanding
12418,Glenna  Vanderhoof,a really easy teacher she make it harder than it has to be and she is very helpful when you ask for her help
12419,Glenna  Vanderhoof,dr vanderhoof was such a joy to take do not take anyone else but her for this class she assigns sort of a lot of homework from the book but so simple that not a big deal she is the sweetest lady who teaches like back in grade again
12420,Glenna  Vanderhoof,take her class you will not regret it
12421,Glenna  Vanderhoof,probably one of the nicest professors ever have so helpful really organized and her classes are almost never the full time her study guide is almost the exact same thing as the test overall a really good teacher and nice lady
12422,Glenna  Vanderhoof,all professors should be so good as a nontraditional student returning after years i can honestly say that she is the real deal i would have quit again had she not inspired me to excell thank you dr vanderhoof
12423,Glenna  Vanderhoof,sweetest lady ever hardly ever makes you stay the whole class period most friday classes last ten minutes
12424,Glenna  Vanderhoof,perfect
12425,Glenna  Vanderhoof,dr vanderhoof is amazing she understands that most students are taking her class it is a required gen ed so she makes it as simple as possible she almost never makes you stay for the whole class period very kind woman and great professor
12426,Glenna  Vanderhoof,she is so sweet and easy
12427,Glenna  Vanderhoof,she is a great teacher very organized and she definately makes her expectations clear lectures are well organized and she gives study guides so you know exactly what you need to study for tests you often get out of class early especially on fridays she has a good sense of humor and is very willing to help you if you need it
12428,Glenna  Vanderhoof,extremely easy my friends told me it was easy but i was not prepared for the simplicity of this teacher and class she explains things very clearly almost to the point of condescension lets you out early a lot and if you read aloud in class when she asks you usually have to go to class on friday highly recommended
12429,Glenna  Vanderhoof,she is the best professor i have had so far in college she is very helpful she keeps this very dull class interesting
12430,Glenna  Vanderhoof,i thought she was fantastic organized thorough and fascinating she was very punctual always let you out early and was very clear on expectations if you are one of those idiots who follow concise directions or leave your phone alone for minutes do us all a favor and take her if you can you will love her
12431,Glenna  Vanderhoof,if you have to take this class do so with dr vanderhoof if you be sorry very nice and very helpful both in and outside of the class oh and ask her about her too
12432,Glenna  Vanderhoof,very respectful awesome teacher but she is painful to listen to she teaches this class as if never seen a computer in your life she is always organized you will never stay in class for the full minutes and hardly ever need to stay moer than minutes of fridays do whatever you can to take her class great teacher and good humor
12433,Glenna  Vanderhoof,she was the most polite and helpful professor i have ever had definitely take her
12434,Glenna  Vanderhoof,very nice lady very helpful almost annoyingly organized but you can always know your grade if you send her an email the way she talks is sometimes annoying but the class is so easy worth putting up with that
12435,Matthew  Reimer,this guy has the easiest job i have ever seen but he is a cool guy though so i would take this course with him all you have to do is walk laps the whole time and you will get an a he sweats alot and ive never seen him work out i find it funny
12436,Matthew  Reimer,matthew is a good professor the quizzes though are very hard unless you spend a lot of time studying
12437,Matthew  Reimer,such an easy class just do the online quizes and labs bs them if you want i got them done in about hours with the free day trial saved me about dollars i would definitely recommend him just show up and at least walk around the gym easiest a i have ever gotten
12438,Matthew  Reimer,he was a very kind and understanding he judgmental and was reasonable recommend him
12439,Matthew  Reimer,easy professor just show up do the easy questions quizzes and free answer labs and pass easy a
12440,Matthew  Reimer,such an easy class if you just show up and do the work if you miss more then classes you automatically fail do the online quizzes and labs right away to get them over with takes like hours to do everything and then done for the semester basically
12441,Matthew  Reimer,reimer is awesome his class is extremely easy he has no tests and all you have to do to pass the class is show up total work for this class is question quizes and labs easiest college class you will take i lifted weights every single class period a nice guy and care what you do at all strongly recommend him
12442,Matthew  Reimer,real immature professor i mean gym so an easy class but it feels like high school and a about attendance take someone else if possible
12443,Matthew  Reimer,i think i did really poor on the online stuff so i got a b but pretty easy class he sits on the bikes upstairs the whole time
12444,Matthew  Reimer,very easy class as long as you show up reimer is a nice guy and explains everything well easy a
12445,Matthew  Reimer,if lazy like me take reimer for your pess requirement if you want you can just walk around the track for minutes easy you really have to exert yourself too much plus almost never in the fieldhouse during class time so you can take breaks and he even notice some students even sat around for the entire period
12446,Matthew  Reimer,show up do the activity of your choosing and fill out the sheet sit down and do the coursework online in two hours easy a
12447,Matthew  Reimer,basketball all you need to do is just show up and show off your point skills and make it rain
12448,Matthew  Reimer,ha ha the class is easy he even talk to you every day it matter who you take but your heart rate does go by show up and fill your log sheet
12449,Matthew  Reimer,he was easy you have to do anything but show up make sure to do all the online quizzes and thats about it
12450,Matthew  Reimer,this an ass
12451,Matthew  Reimer,i got deducted so many points for doing math wrong in his class make sure you divide your hr correctly the class is unstructured but make sure you do the damn online quizzes bucks to pass the class waste of time and money oh well
12452,Matthew  Reimer,waste of time and money make sure your heart rates are divisible by or get docked points what a crock
12453,Matthew  Reimer,the guy is kind of a jerk but the class is easy maybe try a different proffesor
12454,Matthew  Reimer,waste of time but added points to my gpa for an easy a take it show up hang out work out done waste of but whatever
12455,Tracy  Bryson,nice personality bad teacher she said military has a problem with authority and insults her students she brings her political views in the classrooms
12456,Tracy  Bryson,she challenges you to write better which should be the goal of any college level course one of the best professors i have ever had
12457,Tracy  Bryson,i did not like her so much as a teacher first day of class she told us that some of is will not be passing very hard grader and critical if you do not participate in class you will not get a good grade also hates disney movies i tried to talk discuss that and got shot down especially lion king
12458,Tracy  Bryson,she is beyond awful she teaches the class in such a way that no matter what you say she will try to say wrong and when you ask her a question she will not reply with a straight answer she always replies with another question not very helpful unless you meet one on one and still not much more helpful
12459,Tracy  Bryson,it is super hard to understand what she wants from you she is a nice woman though very tough
12460,Tracy  Bryson,grades very unfairly
12461,Tracy  Bryson,she is a good teacher but gets a little crazy and can be confusing at times is much harder than the profs my friends have had in eng
12462,Tracy  Bryson,i thought she was very helpful and a great teacher compared to other english professors that i have come across
12463,Tracy  Bryson,the worst teacher ever
12464,Tracy  Bryson,crazy tracy that sums it all up
12465,Tracy  Bryson,this class sucks
12466,Tracy  Bryson,no comments
12467,Tracy  Bryson,i thought this was a great class as someone who was not very fond of english i really enjoyed this class it helped me think differently
12468,Tracy  Bryson,this woman is evil
12469,Valerie  Rohy,rohy is quirky for sure but she is able to break down the most complicated material to anyone also she encourages adventurous essay topics the more outlandish the better the readings can be boring at times but her lectures never have an agenda in other words the students lead the discussion and she is there to help out when needed
12470,Valerie  Rohy,wonderful professor smart as a whip and funny too material may seem impossible but she makes it easy to digest attendance is mandatory you can miss a few days grades are split between class participation blog posts and papers no tests
12471,Valerie  Rohy,very dry took her class because of the good ratings if you are going to be taking english do it with her
12472,Valerie  Rohy,interesting subject matter good grasp of subject but during discussions she does squint at you as though she thinks the the earth not sure whether i buy that her thinking face grading seems random people who read do well people who do read fail laughs at her own jokes also wipes spit a lot kind of annoying
12473,Valerie  Rohy,i love this woman she is extremely smart and knows what she is talking about the workload is managable although she is a tough grader she is witty and funny and will take the time to explain whatever it is that you do not understand i encourage anybody to take a class with her i left her class feeling smarter because of her
12474,Valerie  Rohy,very dedicated professor great at explaining complicated theoretical texts and connecting them to the larger picture a tough grader but a tip if she allows you to turn in a rough draft of any essay for her comments and suggestions beforehand do it you will have a much better understanding of what looking for
12475,Valerie  Rohy,unbelievably smart and has a wonderful way of boiling down ridiculously complicated critical essays into terms the average person can understand also is very funny in an intellectual sort of way had her for english and am taking another class with her next semester solely because she is teaching it a favorite
12476,Valerie  Rohy,tough class but she did a tremendous job explaining intense theoretical issues with the texts and she is incredibly helpful
12477,Valerie  Rohy,awesome very interesting dedicated strange but in a really cool way
12478,Valerie  Rohy,she is very smart and extremely dedicated but not very good at class discussion
12479,Valerie  Rohy,some students are totally lazy but if you are motivated you will learn a bunch
12480,Valerie  Rohy,if you actually read the material and make the connections between the theoretical and the primary texts golden prof rohy makes every effort to help in this process she answers emails always and is more than not in her office very very dedicated also very smart perhaps the most misunderstood professor at uvm
12481,Valerie  Rohy,one of my fav all time classes
12482,Valerie  Rohy,she spent time on books she have her grading system is very questionable and her class is not very interesting
12483,Valerie  Rohy,ugh this class was so boring she good at stimulating interesting discussions and practically has to pry reactions out of students the book choices are not great either she is nice and helpful but the class is unbearably boring
12484,Valerie  Rohy,unclear subject matter plays favorites
12485,Valerie  Rohy,the class discussions in general are dull uninspired and hard to follow the professor tries to be helpful decoding what we are learning and is a fair grader but the class is just unbeareable and completely unenjoyable
12486,Valerie  Rohy,the discussions we had in this class were not guided and vague i felt it needed more direction the books we read were close to unbearable class sucked but she is a helpful professor

12489,David  Huddle,great class do the work and put the time effort into the workshop and all he can ask of you besides this class he has been super helpful in getting my portfolio together and academic advising great teacher great guy
12490,David  Huddle,no comments
12491,David  Huddle,his books were definetly not mediocre story of a million years is breathtaking and the wolf girl is really bizzare and fascinating and plenty of literary critics agreed i love uvm and transferred out but just talking to him made school more palatable for me while i was there take another class with him if i was still there
12492,David  Huddle,seems to be a very fair person i like listening to him read aloud but not everyone does his written comments are sometimes odd
12493,David  Huddle,no comments
12494,David  Huddle,huddle is laid back good sense of humor but beware in this class at least of your grade is popquizzes on the readings easy but you have to do the readings also class can get a bit dull you read out loud a lot but is mostly easy and a good excuse to just read the books
12495,David  Huddle,goodnatured and fun one of my favorite classes the readings were enjoyable too
12496,David  Huddle,he is really anal about reading aloud in class but his intentions are all good and the workload is pretty easy i thought when he handed out signed copies of his book it was a nice gesture though he does have kind of a bad taste in literature
12497,David  Huddle,no comments
12498,David  Huddle,david huddle is the best teacher at uvm he is indeed the greatest
12499,David  Huddle,no comments
12500,David  Huddle,best class ever best professor ever david classes are always great he creates a wonderful and supportive atmosphere for workshopping he is always respectful and constructive with criticism he also has a great sense of humor if you have an opportunity to take a class with him do it
12501,David  Huddle,lots of workshopping in a really mature and supportive atmosphere always makes himself available for extra help encouraging
12502,David  Huddle,inspiring helpful understanding talented etc his writing classes were amazingly helpful to me
12503,David  Huddle,great class great teacher hilarious but of your grade is based on in class quizzes but if you do the reading you will be fine
12504,David  Huddle,no comments
12505,Peter B.  Harris,such a wonderful professor he really know how to teach you and how to calm you down he has a very special way of helping you understand the world and yourself through writing you would be missing out if you take his class
12506,Peter B.  Harris,harris actually made me like en115 great teacher recommend to anyone
12507,Peter B.  Harris,amazing teacher he really helped me get better at writing and was cool when i asked for an extension everyone should take at least one of his classes
12508,Peter B.  Harris,extends due dates as long as you talk to him he is super chill awesome professor would totally recommend
12509,Peter B.  Harris,immensely helpful the essays are actually fun to write because he gives broad topics super chill extends due dates as long as you talk to him awesome professor would totally recommend
12510,Peter B.  Harris,i had a fantastic experience with prof harris extremely nice and i learned a lot about writing from him also had a fair bit of interesting life that always remember and helped his students maintain perspective overall an excellent prof and i highly recommend for en115
12511,Peter B.  Harris,extremely helpful he expects a lot and digresses a lot but i learned so much from him take his classes if you can
12512,Peter B.  Harris,for a guy who get his own poetry published this guy was pretty tough on other peoples art what we learned were his prejudices about poetry and how to write representational poetry he needs to realize that anyone who does the work is really trying to be creative and be sensitive to how hard it is to put personal stuff out there like that
12513,Peter B.  Harris,words cannot describe how wonderful harris is if dreading the eng req just take any harris is teaching he spends most of class teaching you about life but he knows how to incorporate the important english basics participate in his class he will never be a jerk and allow you to formulate your ideas i love harris
12514,Peter B.  Harris,harris is an interesting man with fantastic insights that eager to share the class is interesting but often lacks direction harris really wants his students to improve their writing and available for extra help however really unclear about what he wants on assignments which creates a lot of confusion he also cusses in class
12515,Peter B.  Harris,great professor though very demanding as well i learned a lot in his class
12516,Peter B.  Harris,a good guy and a fair grader overall a different but very solid professor
12517,Peter B.  Harris,best professor at this school this man is brilliant
12518,Peter B.  Harris,no comments
12519,Peter B.  Harris,i love this man one of the kindest people ever met

12521,Peter B.  Harris,no comments
12522,Peter B.  Harris,prof harris is such a chilled out teacher and very fun but is often unclear about assignments
12523,Peter B.  Harris,best professor i have ever had this guy is amazing
12524,Wilma  Saffran,she is very simple the class is clear to follow she can be a bit of a picky grader as she will not really give perfect scores for simple assignments she does let you resubmit to gain back any lost points and lets you turn in late assignments easy to approach easy to get a good grade if you just go to class and do all the assignments
12525,Wilma  Saffran,dr saffran is an excellent choice for biochem2 the class is either filled with seniors or graduate students so not competing with freshmen anymore her tests are tough but like kumar and expect the occasional trick question she adjusts the grade by a few points based on how well the class is doing straightforward
12526,Wilma  Saffran,this professor makes basic biochem pretty easy if you pay attention and go to lecture her lecture notes are clear and is willing to answer questions as long as you put in the work on your end and do the practice exams you will do well
12527,Wilma  Saffran,i took the class because i am going into a research based career it is very informative and helpful toward that goal but the professor respond to emails it sort of frustrating as you start to do the page paper at the end of the class
12528,Wilma  Saffran,biochem very difficult the material hard to grasp and understand at least to me if it is for you go to lecture explanations will make this play what makes this course challenging is memorizing reactions put the time in and youll also have an a and still be able to recall almost all the reactions a year later
12529,Wilma  Saffran,what a pointless class you learn absolutely nothing and she comes off as cold she is so picky when it comes to grading honestly it seems pointless to even go to this class i thought introduction to research would be more informative but this class is useless and thats it
12530,Wilma  Saffran,simply the best allows resubmission of assignments for a better grade good class for those interested in a researchbased career
12531,Wilma  Saffran,easy professor very clear and helpful as long as you understand the materials in class which is impossible not will do fine on the exams i didnt need to read the textbook at all all i did was go over my notes which was what she wrote on the board
12532,Wilma  Saffran,the class was interesting learned a lot about different qc faculty research interests which helped me discover my own research pursuits she is extremely accessible by email or by meeting before or after class a research topic that interests you is chosen and a pg paper and presentation is based on that a great intro to the world of research
12533,Wilma  Saffran,she seems nice and sweet but shde is really not very unclear about research useless class at all just need it because it looks good on transcript total waste of time
12534,Wilma  Saffran,she is really sweet made it clear what she expected from students brought in department heads to talk to us about their research so that we could see what we would potentially be interested in i learned alot about how to conduct research i how to find a research mentor and start working in a lab final presentation term paper are reasonable
12535,Wilma  Saffran,makes terms more easy she takes her time explaining the subject slow paced yet she tends to repeat herself a bit go to class and just listen to her she is great slides are clear textbook not so much but does help in dire needs she will make u understand chemistry like never before
12536,Wilma  Saffran,she makes chemistry sound easy she teaches slowly straight from her slides the tests come straight from that but be careful with math mistakes if you have the choice of professors for this class take her
12537,Wilma  Saffran,she is excruciatingly thorough she explains everything in minute detail but overall a good teacher tests are fair harsh grading on easy questions and more lenient on the harder ones
12538,Wilma  Saffran,alright better than other chem professors are fair
12539,Wilma  Saffran,great understandable approachable slides are clear come straight from book but i would suggest getting it anyway bc its helpful requires work but saffran is the way to go for sure
12540,Wilma  Saffran,easy class go to class participate all u need is to write a ten page paper and give a presentation its hard to read her to kno if she is happy or not with u but still eary
12541,Wilma  Saffran,helpful goto class and get her notes every exam is straight from her notes puts chemistry into an easy perspective and does not demand too much except to do well in her class you will enjoy this professor alot
12542,Wilma  Saffran,no comments
12543,Wilma  Saffran,makes biochem manageable
12544,Christine  Jackson,dr jackson is so awesome one of the smartest people when it comes to literature she gives a ton of mini reading quizzes so read and do fine a fun professor take her if you can
12545,Christine  Jackson,science fiction and fantasy lit is a great class both because of the subject matter and because of prof jackson she assigns stories for nearly every class but all things you can knock out in an hour or two at most do the reading and ace the quizzes plus more than willing to review papers and offer useful suggestions
12546,Christine  Jackson,take science fiction and fantasy lit jackson is soo incredibly helpful she gives so much feedback and will reply to any and all emails in a very timely manner there are quizzes almost every class but you just need to read to pass its very easy the essays and thesis proofs are not bad as well you watch movies too very interesting class
12547,Christine  Jackson,overall dr jackson is a good professor friendly and easy to reach jackson is very picky and i also believes she grades students based on her history with them as this was an week course the work was fairly easy but increased toward the end make sure to have the materials and read the class discussions were great you must participate
12548,Christine  Jackson,dr jackson is a very good professor i had to take her class because it was required her quizzes are fairly easy if you read before each class she is a tough grader when it comes to essays
12549,Christine  Jackson,great professor very clear about her expectations fair grader and extremely helpful read the material before class daily quizzes easy stuff if you read have opinions and be prepared to share them major essays overall her class is worth taking never a dull class and you will learn a great deal one of the best at nova
12550,Christine  Jackson,this was one of the most interesting classes i ever took she is very relevant and knows how to relate to students well if you attend class and turn in everything on time you should get at least a b easily
12551,Christine  Jackson,she was unorganized when it came to keeping up with my grades she had errors in her grade book luckily i kepttrack of everything she was careless when it came to making the corrections but she finally did she criticized my paper topics after i turned them in even though i consulted with her prior ti the due date
12552,Christine  Jackson,not an easy class she has very high expectations but you will learn a lot she gives a lot of feedback on your papers which really does help you write better ones she also bring in a lot of relevant material from art music film etc great discussions greeat
12553,Christine  Jackson,great professor you will have a lot of work and you really do have to read the book but willing to help you essays were difficult though
12554,Christine  Jackson,good teacher do your work try your best she is fair in her grading this class will be hard if you are not good at writing papers but if you are good enough to impress her do great
12555,Christine  Jackson,she really is great very clear helpful and work with you until however long you need it she grades kind of tough and has a lot of comments on your work but after you get to know her style cake
12556,Christine  Jackson,simply one of the greatest drops all her work to attend to her students awesome
12557,Christine  Jackson,excellent teacher
12558,Christine  Jackson,i like her a lot very helpful
12559,Christine  Jackson,no comments
12560,Christine  Jackson,she is an awesome teacher took time away from her busy schedule to read over my essay and help me make some changes to it she is a fair grader and an overall nice professor if you have to take any type of writing or lit class take her
12561,Christine  Jackson,strick but fair
12562,Christine  Jackson,personal favorite
12563,Christine  Jackson,very helpful a terrific instructor
12564,Skip  Pomeroy,superior teaching style much of the way i teach now is allotted to him
12565,Skip  Pomeroy,the man is a total flake and boot granted he knows what talking about but watch you backs ladies
12566,Skip  Pomeroy,excellent professor.i learned a great deal in his class.i took him for one class but i still go to him all the time to ask questions.he has a passion for teaching and will go out of his way to help students who really try.good professor to take if ur taking mcat.doesnt spoonfeed students.his class was rather challenging because he made me think
12567,Skip  Pomeroy,good professor no doubt that he really knows chemistry he is however fast paced and loves to hear himself talk participation in his class is not very encouraged and he enjoys humiliating students he refers to himself as which is a little disturbing to say the least yet he remains the best chemistry professor at nsu in my opinion
12568,Skip  Pomeroy,online class contact with him sort of fizzeled throughout the semester basically he never answered his emails easy class only asked for quizzes essays and discussion postings no final
12569,Skip  Pomeroy,great teacher explains as much as he can and helps a lot he knows his stuff and doesnt refer to his notes every two sec like giarikos great sense of humor always there to help you make chem worth siting through for chem i revolved my schedule aorund this mans class i been with him semesters and have great chem grades till now
12570,Skip  Pomeroy,not as bad as everyone makes him sound yes his class is hard but he challenges you available for extra help when you need him and offers a different teaching method which i found very effective
12571,Skip  Pomeroy,great guy makes chem classes fun
12572,Skip  Pomeroy,he needs to learn how to watch his mouth and teach so students understand
12573,Skip  Pomeroy,i did not like him at all i rather have a hard shenbagh than an easy poemro i did not learn anything in class
12574,Skip  Pomeroy,tried hard was geniunely nice guy material was taught via think about it obvious all you have to do is visualize it which work too well for me but at least he cut us some slack and recognized that we tried and passed us
12575,Skip  Pomeroy,he is an awesome professor who is willing to help his students he is very passionate in teaching and understandable
12576,Skip  Pomeroy,incredibly mean and heartless constantly swears in class gdammit this fin thing here and more just rude crude and crass
12577,Sudeb  Mitra,he does tell you what questions are exactly going to be on the exams thats why i did well in his class unclear in his teaching so i just memorize what he writes i honestly learned much from him he says easy a third grader can understand this been teaching this course for many years so of course easy to him
12578,Sudeb  Mitra,mitra is very knowledgable in math one of the smartest professors around he does get little annoyed when students ask him questions from previous courses he expects you to know everything however his reviews are similar to exams so do ll the class problems and review you should be fine not a real tough grader gives lot of partial credit
12579,Sudeb  Mitra,as always he do much to mislead his students he tests you on what he says test you on save for about points of stuff that on the review to see if you really learned anything and just memorize the review it is very easy to do well in his class and the graduate students love him
12580,Sudeb  Mitra,his lectures are awful take for an easy a not if you want to learn anything
12581,Sudeb  Mitra,gives partial credits you have to work very hard to get an a and f easily passable
12582,Sudeb  Mitra,he is a bit rude and gets annoyed when you ask for help however his class is ridiculously easy show up for the reviews get the test questions and study that he will teach you what you need to know but only tests a narrow spectrum of the material if you want a great grade take him
12583,Sudeb  Mitra,should avoid no help at help never get a chance to ask question
12584,Sudeb  Mitra,good professor took him in the summer class exams are based on his reviews
12585,Sudeb  Mitra,mitra is very smart with that said however not very good at teaching expect to furiously write the examples he solves on the board leaving the class confused and teaching yourself no hw and there are exams plus a final he does drop the lowest grade of one of the regular exams if not very good at math say stay away
12586,Sudeb  Mitra,i said with a and above in my exams my lowest grade was a and a in the final i received an a the departmental brought down my avg
12587,Sudeb  Mitra,hard to understand when you first start the class but then it gets easier his tests are exactly the same questions he did in class and on the review day you need the textbook
12588,Sudeb  Mitra,i dont know how that buddy get an a with average grade on exams are but he still gave me wht is that
12589,Sudeb  Mitra,great professor received an a w and above on all exam drops the lowest grade not sure wht my departmental grade was but very linear show that you care attend all classes makes a key difference on if getting a b or a exams even the departmental comes from his miss them go over h.w class probs should b ok
12590,Sudeb  Mitra,the worst and least helpful math prof i have ever meet drop it now5408
12591,Sudeb  Mitra,go to his clss equal to learn by yourself
12592,Sudeb  Mitra,why not let people rate him he is the worest prof ever
12593,Sudeb  Mitra,worst prof u taking it better drop it
12594,Sudeb  Mitra,he is goofy mistakes are goofy and his class is usually enjoyable go to class take notes go to review and you can ace his class very nice when it comes to grading and his exams are like the review one of the best at queens so far
12595,Sudeb  Mitra,it was very difficult to keep up but as long as you take good notes you will be prepared for the exams
12596,Sudeb  Mitra,a good professor some people just misunderstand his intention because he does get annoyed easily but he mean any harm also know who audience is every graduate student loves center but undergrad students who are bad at math like him
12597,Tracey  Johnston,a hottie
12598,Tracey  Johnston,no comments
12599,Tracey  Johnston,fairly cool teacher but really into ecology be warned the ecology is mindless busywork today we counted how many mealworms were being bred in a mound by hand2300 but she is by far the best and easiest of all the lab teachers
12600,Tracey  Johnston,no comments
12601,Tracey  Johnston,no comments
12602,Henry  Schreiber,doc shreiber was my favorite prof took every class he taught played chess with him a few times taught me as much out of class as he did in class
12603,Henry  Schreiber,i took him for ss1.all we did was watch movies the whole time and then go home the only test we had all ss1 was the final that was put together with by the students he passed out a sguide the answers highlighted and that is exactly how the test was spelling errors and all i went to call about made take him evertime you can
12604,Henry  Schreiber,please take anyone but him have had him for classes and he talks about the same things in all which have nothing to do with psychology his lectures are pointless his tests are ridiculously hard because he wants you to know everything like a professional but teaches none of it grades are random very unprofessional
12605,Henry  Schreiber,he is a very easy professor i do not think i ever made below an a he did have some health complications recently he was always helpful to me
12606,Henry  Schreiber,dr s is getting a bad wrap i must admit i graduated a few years ago now fact is the reason he gave up making class managed is because he got so many complaints about his class being to hard it really broke his spirit i am currently a ph.d student in neuroscience and he prepared me well you have to get on his level and listen
12607,Henry  Schreiber,physioyou need the book for any of his classes he posts study questions online and if you memorize them you will know at least half or more of the test he curves every test you have to attend class but every time you do and he passes a roll sheet around you get a of a bonus point added to your final grade and he is hilarious
12608,Henry  Schreiber,took him for physio animal bhvr worst teacher ever it is seriously a poverty to this school that they keep a man like this on their payroll example he showed a video one class next class he says he was sorry he showed the wrong one he was there watching the whole video also his review questions might as well be used on mad gab avoid
12609,Henry  Schreiber,he is the worst college professor i have ever come into contact with he does an awful job of preparing you for your major you will suffer in lack of knowledge if you take him he does not teach he tries to make jokes that are funny but is unsuccessful he should retire now do not take his class if you want feedback or knowledge of the topic
12610,Henry  Schreiber,if a psyc major at utt you will have to take dr schrieber for several classes he is a very knowledgable professor but has no pedagogic ability whatsoever granted you will make an a guaranteed but you learn anything at all dr schriber may be a cool guy but his classes are a total waste of time and money
12611,Henry  Schreiber,dr schreiber is a very intelligent funny man but he has no teaching skills he spends the whole semester talking about completely irrelevant topics you will be required to learn the material on your own his exams are extremely difficult but it really matter since he curves them anyway total waste of time and money
12612,Henry  Schreiber,great
12613,Henry  Schreiber,worst professor ever had his class was a waste of my time and my money he never actually taught anything he just went over possible test questions and gave you the answers every day i will never take him again and you either if you actually want to learn
12614,Henry  Schreiber,all he does in class is go over what will be on the test we get really long reviews which end up being only half the test just confusing but if you study the reviews you will do fine because he gives curves
12615,Henry  Schreiber,i took dr shreiber for l c he is a pretty good professor but he does kind of ramble i thought i would dread the lab but it was actually kind of fun the tests that bad and the quizzes in lab are a joke you do have to read the book and he does expect you to talk about the chapters in class he was fun and kept it interesting
12616,Henry  Schreiber,schreiber is awful u never know whats going to be on his tests and he lectures about evolution and everything that is not on the test its up to u to read all the chapters and figure out what the test will be i do not recommend him at all steer clear
12617,Henry  Schreiber,this guy is great great sense of humor in a class that should have an intro to l c class the reading is very very difficult but there are certain fundamentals that the good doctor wants you to pick up if you can grasp that concept and make sure he gets the study guide to you then you will have a good time will take again
12618,Henry  Schreiber,i think schreiber rocks great funny and interesting if you keep up with the subject read each chapter that is assigned and show up for lab he gives test study guides that are multiple choice and gives the answers to them passed all his test just by reading and going over the study guide my favorite teacher so far
12619,Henry  Schreiber,the i teach i profess bullcorn has been played out on me before i took this class it is an utter waste of time and space i pay his dang salary so i expect to be taught something i learned more psychology from watching evangelion URL than from his class
12620,Henry  Schreiber,awful teacher do not take him nice guy but a bad teacher his lecture has nothing to do with the tests and neither do the readings on most tests the highest grade is a c his tests come from random topics that students have never heard of my favorite is when he said he was a professor so he is not hear to teach
12621,Henry  Schreiber,no comments
12622,Meijuan  Dong,her class is awesome attend class do the work try your best and you will do fine akk her classes are easy once you put in a lot of effort
12623,Meijuan  Dong,i love this teacher she encourages everyone to know chinese at basic level she really cares about her students especially those who struggle attendance matters so miss out the fun
12624,Meijuan  Dong,she teaches simplified chinese.so if a transfer student and your previous classes used traditional char then got two to simplified and relearn the words starting from ch no way jose or continue with your traditional char but keep in mind that questions on exams and all class activities will be in simplied only
12625,Meijuan  Dong,if you know any of chinese then it would be very hard for you the majority of this class are chinese or at least abc so why they can get good grade from her
12626,Meijuan  Dong,took her for the summer a great class and i learned a lot
12627,Meijuan  Dong,i loved her she was the easiest and greatest teacher to but for her class attendence does matter so
12628,Brian  Storey,the course is easy he is not great he nit picks at little thing get on his bad side other then that he is fine nothing special notes are all over the pace just read the text do his assignments
12629,Brian  Storey,no comments
12630,Brian  Storey,great teacher very clear on what he wants and will help you anytime on any of your assignments and answer any questions even if its not related to the course very passionate about what he teaches and concise and considerate about everyone in the class
12631,Brian  Storey,really nice guy very willing to help you if you have any questions about the assignments and creates interesting class discussions just be late for class and say thank you p.s kinda cute too
12632,Brian  Storey,not a good teacher this guy picks on you as well if he thinks you lack self esteem he will pick on you on purpose just to impress the rest of the class he thinks he is pretty hot too which makes me laugh
12633,Brian  Storey,good teacher
12634,Brian  Storey,damn good teacher practices what he preaches whoever says he teach probably listen in class and likes to slack off dude thats me and i still learnt so much he made me want to learn a lot of assignments but easy whoever says it clear because youre dumb and dont listen take him but dont slack
12635,Brian  Storey,brian is a great teacher who loves what he does and it shows his notes were great and i found the lectures interesting and informative overall i found his classes very easy
12636,Brian  Storey,an ok instructor assignments are a bit confusing as if not even sure what he really wants from us the assignments all that useful and he gave us way too much time in class to work on them
12637,Brian  Storey,brian is a total joke his notes were and teach before we knew it we had a midterm and no one in the class knew an easy class though you really need him to teach you very much if you look at your manual and book you will do fine the flp is easy
12638,Brian  Storey,brian is a very bad teacher i would not recommend anyone talke his classes if they have to he is very unclear and all over the map with his teaching
12639,Brian  Storey,looks like lance armstrong lives like lance armstrong good role model good class
12640,Brian  Storey,inspirational teacher very fair marker makes class fun and interesting
12641,Brian  Storey,he tells you one thing asks you to do it and then totally changes his mind he isnt helpful in the least im not a fan of him
12642,Brian  Storey,i believe he does not have a hot pepper cuz this instructor is hot stuff he can teach too fun class and funny guy
12643,Brian  Storey,excellent teacher very fun and knowledgeable about course material and give extremely fair tests for the midterm and final i really cant say anything bad about him as a professor if you get a chance to take classes with him you wont regret it
12644,Brian  Storey,great teacher one of my favorites he is super funny and entertaining plus you learn a lot
12645,Brian  Storey,the best sports science teacher
12646,Brian  Storey,fun teacher but i found that he isnt always clear in what he was teaching and doesnt always give a straight answer but the class was fun
12647,Brian  Storey,good teacher his classes were alot of fun and the text was interesting and useful i enjoyed his class and he was always upbeat and excited like to take anohter class with him in the future highly reccomended

12650,Evalee  Lasater,horrible
12651,Evalee  Lasater,awful
12652,Evalee  Lasater,not good at all
12653,Evalee  Lasater,absolutely aweful uncooperative and unwilling to help students set in her ways and overdue for retirement
12654,Evalee  Lasater,she seems nice but some of these posts make me wonder heard a terrible story about how the teacher i was observing let another kid who was observing him off for a day to take care of his sick girlfriend or something lasater found out even though this teacher insisted the kid stay home and he was booted out of the program ouch
12655,Evalee  Lasater,past time to retire
12656,Evalee  Lasater,get serious
12657,Evalee  Lasater,she is more concerned about appearances she pretends to be nice and helpful but if you want to do anything besides teach in the rolla area she will immediately turn her back on you in all the students used to talk about what we could do to get her fired i know anyone who liked her but we all pretended to so she would pass us
12658,Evalee  Lasater,a little outdated for an education teacher someone who was in the school system while dinosaurs were still on the earth should not still be teaching classes on education in my humble opinion that and she tends to be more concerned with appearances than with quality so as long as you and your papers look cute be fine
12659,Evalee  Lasater,very sweet lady genuinely concerned about her students highly recommed
12660,Evalee  Lasater,great teacher sweet lady
12661,Evalee  Lasater,what a wonderful teacher she goes out of her way to be helpful to every student all the time i am very impressed with the quality of her instruction and the depth of her involvement with her students
12662,Susan  Cullen,i had her back in in night school definetely a people person emphasized humanitarian qualities and interpersonal skills she is a professional counsellor and it shows strong feedback does not simply mark right or wrong carefully reads answer and your understanding of concepts but a few students did not take to her approach
12663,Susan  Cullen,very thorough impressive knowledge of the subject matter hr administration reading load and difficulty of quizzes were higher than other hr courses still a good learning experience took the time to read and make comments on written work
12664,Terry  Adams,easy class tries to make the subject interesting but have much success its just a boring subject to work with cares about his students a lot and is always willing to help if needed
12665,Terry  Adams,he is the definition of an effective teacher very willing to help and is understanding the material is a little boring and his powerpoints get kind of old but if you study what he tells you to it will be on the test do fine excellent class discussions
12666,Terry  Adams,tuff couse and kinda dry he did the best he could with the subject
12667,Terry  Adams,the professor is very knowledgeable he is making a dry subject somewhat interesting
12668,Terry  Adams,soo knowledgeable very personable too his classes are fun because you learn but also feel comfortable in expressing disagreement with him wish he taught all my education classes
12669,Jerry  Giger,he kind of trails off when he talks not that a lot of what he says is important to take down gave us his powerpoints and the tests were open but you had to voice your opinion on those as well just go on about how important children are to you
12670,Jerry  Giger,this class was horrible i would not recommend it to anyone
12671,Jerry  Giger,i enjoyed going to class his teaching environment was conducive to learning and he made you feel welcome and important not just a student to pour information into
12672,Tangan  Gao,such a good professor i loved going to class because his reactions are hilarious class was very fun and he really does want everyone to pass just make sure to understand all the examples he gives in class and do well
12673,Tangan  Gao,i took gao for calculus i over summer he was very helpful and cared to explain my mistakes without asking him he seems to choose material purely out of care to prepare us for harder classes i had some trouble listening to his lecture but overall his communication was excellent i definitely recommend taking him for a semester
12674,Tangan  Gao,gao is a tough cookie he has an accent and tends to be very lazy when executing problems for the class but i enjoyed his class he assigns weekly homework weekly quizzes three midterms and one comprehensive twice of a midterm he will try to trick you on some of his quizzes but the midterms and final are chosen from hw questions
12675,Tangan  Gao,professor gao can be lazy at times but overall his class is somewhat easy he has a heavy accent so it is difficult to understand him at times a lenient grader there are four included and like quizzes overall if you can avoid him avoid him else you wont regret it
12676,Tangan  Gao,he is a really helpful professor he wants students to succeed he does have a strong accent but once you are in class and listening to him easy to ignore definitely one of the most caring and considerate professors at csulb
12677,Tangan  Gao,pros really cares and tries to helpful very funny jokes makes calculus a little more interesting cons thick chinese accent easy to understand if used to asian accents
12678,Tangan  Gao,great teacher this is exactly what you need to do to pass his class do all the homework write down all the examples all three exams come from the hw and example test are easy if you study the hw and examples quizes every week lets you use notes take him hes great im not the smartest person and i got an a
12679,Tangan  Gao,gao is nice enough but the class seemed a bit disorganized no schedule or class assignments listed ahead of time the book sucks and is chock full of errors despite this i did well in the class ignore laugh or statements of how easy everything is he will help you during office hours and is usually pretty good in clarifying concepts
12680,Tangan  Gao,his lectures are a bit confusing easier to just study on your own but he is a very lenient grader quizes are open book and tests are pretty straight forward not too bad
12681,Tangan  Gao,on easy plug this guy this guy in
12682,Tangan  Gao,excellent professor i think his thick accent might be discouraging on the first day but pick up on it tests are easy and a nice grader the class was very interesting and he clearly cares about his students in the end a pleasant experience overall would definitely take him again
12683,Tangan  Gao,he has an accent most will understand what he is saying but there will be a lot of times where he says something that sounds like gibberish helpful not so much guaranteed a no a math class either good at it or not if in between it all depends on how well you can understand book highschool like class
12684,Tangan  Gao,very sweet professor he knows math analysis like the back of his hand his tests are not difficult at all he includes proof on his tests which i think is unfair because a lot of non math majors are required to take the class smart professor with an accent but it doesnt effect lectures he cuts slack for the programming quizzes every week
12685,Tangan  Gao,dr gao was without a doubt one of the worst professors ever had he is extremely difficult to understand and doesnt seem to care he also has great difficuly properly answering questions
12686,Tangan  Gao,hard to understand because of his accent goes over material really fast i didnt feel like i was prepared for the tests he is a really nice guy tho and he sometimes just gives everyone on the quizzes when we dont understand it sometimes doesnt collect homework and gives everyone points for doing it
12687,Tangan  Gao,this teacher is cool has an accent while speaking but in time easy to catch on a real nice guy that helps all his students cares about them laid back and goofy i enjoyed his class it made finite math not so boring his tests too bad either if you understand the homework do fine
12688,Tangan  Gao,hard class for the graduate students even more torturous for the undergraduates horrible book both book and gao expected a lot of prior knowledge but very helpful as long as you ask go to his office or ask him quetsions in class good luck
12689,Tangan  Gao,good class he goes through material quickly but if you go to class everyday and pay attention so fine computer labs are not that big of a deal since all the programs are already written
12690,Tangan  Gao,very very hard to understand due to his accent so if you arent a math wiz it will be very hard for you to learn and pass the class
12691,Tangan  Gao,hard to understand but math and he writes it on the baord so ok teaches the subject well and kinda goofy so it makes class interesting good teacher overall
12692,Tom  Streeter,doc is a fantastic professor obvious how much he loves jazz he plays favorites for sure but if you prove yourself to him as a musician have more faith in you
12693,Tom  Streeter,what a ass if you can avoid this guy only interested in himself and give a crap about the student tenure is a horrible thing
12694,Tom  Streeter,ensemble rocked he gave us music that was a challenge and really pushed us musically jazz history is a cake walk if you only hold a minor interest amazing musician for a stiff morman doc is awesome
12695,Tom  Streeter,no comments
12696,Tom  Streeter,doc is awesome the man seems so bland on the surface but every once in a while say something just shock you i.e eat the elephant in small bites
12697,Tom  Streeter,nice guy yeah understanding not so much lost an assignment i spent hours on too bad technology has an interest but not enough to keep me awake at
12698,Tom  Streeter,i hate him he is vague and boring all of his assignments were complete jokes and he had no idea how to explain even the simplist concepts never take a class with him he is so unclear that i even begin to describe
12699,Tom  Streeter,great guy i mean it funny too
12700,Tom  Streeter,doc is awesome who would say otherwise helpful and very nice he cares about student progress and gets excited when students make improvements just a cool jazz man
12701,Sebastian  Bartos,first be late second remember to take notes questions on the exams are based on his notes short term paper and easy map test however the midterm and the final exam are so difficult and tricky nice and gentle with a little bit accent of polish pass his class but be able to get a high grade like a
12702,Sebastian  Bartos,excellent professor always willing to help his tests are a little tough but he is very easy with grading everything else and gives a lot of credit for in class participation
12703,Sebastian  Bartos,i know what kind of student wrote the previous comment but what he said is not true this professor has a wonderful personality very helpful just ask his lectures are very clear yes the midterm was harder than i thought however i definately learned a lot in his class
12704,Sebastian  Bartos,a very nice guy but so boring too much reading per night dreadful pages and more tries to trick us midterm was hard intentionally so people will drop his class final review was given but final was too tricky easy paper to write sarcastic rude and does help students i felt that i shouldnt gotten a high grade
12705,Sebastian  Bartos,i so interested in history until i took this professor there is no reason not to pull off an a as long as you take good notes his lecture notes are basically all from the book the map test is really easy if you study same goes for the midterm and final plus he has a great personality do yourself a favor and take him if you can
12706,Sebastian  Bartos,this guy is something he will make you either laugh or cry the map exam is easy the other i guess too cause if you read book and notes be fine just know the stuff he assigned for the particular day
12707,Sebastian  Bartos,a really great teacher actually very interesting for such a potentially boring topic but his tests are murderous and a tough marker highest grade was a b on the midterm and in the end the curve was not so great also very understanding with proofread papers before grading and give a chance to do better only problem is tests
12708,Sebastian  Bartos,great just get notice and your on your way to an easy a
12709,Sebastian  Bartos,great professor three tests all easy one paper real simple always willing to help you out great in every aspect
12710,Sebastian  Bartos,just finished his class it was difficult but very interesting his personality is fantastic he seems to love what he is doing
12711,Sebastian  Bartos,if you pay attention and take notes anyone can pass it if you have hard time paying attention and need to be guided every step of the way then take somebody of the work is on your own but he will help out
12712,Sebastian  Bartos,just took the map test and got one more test and one final they are not cummutive
12713,Sebastian  Bartos,it all depends if you want to take minutes to read from the book as well as the class notes there is nothing new that you have not seen before try to get notice with questions and stuff like that
12714,Sebastian  Bartos,i had a very good time in his class the discussions were great he has a fantastic and sharp sense of humor the tests and the final easy if you pay attention
12715,Sebastian  Bartos,hes a nice guy but boring as all hell he put me to sleep each day the semester dragged.he lectures which is boring doesnt have a good method of teaching.i recommend him to anyone unless you can read comprehend the info on your own pass
12716,Sebastian  Bartos,he seems a little unfriendly during class but when you speak to him after class a great guy and very understanding if you work hard and participate in class it is easy to do well his tests are straightfoward and he gives you a review sheet i wish all prof were like him
12717,Sebastian  Bartos,he is a very good professor look if you got problems like i did just speak to him after class explain the issue participate in class discussions do your job and you will have a good great but work hard
12718,Sebastian  Bartos,easy prof agree with previous posts that he tends to ramblre and is a bit unorganized but overall pretty easy and gives good grades and he gives a review sheet for final and test also lets you hand in paper early to discuss with him nice and laid back easy to do well and get an a
12719,Sebastian  Bartos,pretty nice guy very opinionated but he hears out everyone and is pretty reasonable knows his stuff and the class discussions are pretty good if you know the material do fine
12720,Sebastian  Bartos,he knows the material very well and adds many interesting details you will enjoy his class
12721,Andrew  Glennon,weird weird guy the class was presented so dryly the class was nothing more than okay optional homework no quizzes just the exams that come with study guides that contain i would say about of the material that will be on exam he explains things well but has weird rules like no use of laptops in class
12722,Andrew  Glennon,he doesnt seem to care about the students
12723,Andrew  Glennon,i had mr glennon last year this teacher cannot teach i studied the book for hours and when i understand something he would refer me to the book if he said anything at all if you care about your gpa avoid this teacher this is the only class ever recieved a i studied alot pretty mean and care about the class
12724,Andrew  Glennon,hands down worst math teacher i have ever had argued with students condescending and bizarre there were four huge which more resembled a midterms no review of material hwk assignments and class examples do not match questions v rude man stay away at all costs drop it repeat avoid glennon
12725,Andrew  Glennon,terrible just god awful i have always understood math but this man just ruined it for me quizzes are huge and even go along with the homework no matter what avoid this teacher extremely rude and talks down to his students overall just a mean guy
12726,Andrew  Glennon,this guy walks around with his hairdu doesnt know right from wrong gives no chance to those who fight for their grade avoid him at all costs rather go hooked on phonics then to be taught by this teacher
12727,Andrew  Glennon,i tried so hard to adhere to this ridiculous teaching style but ended up getting screwed on his his page quizes he does not even assign that much homework if enrolled in his class read the entire book multiple times and do every homework assignment expecially the ones he does not assign
12728,Andrew  Glennon,this is a difficult class with a very difficult professor he tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question he grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing you really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a c or better
12729,Andrew  Glennon,if your quiz grade hits rock bottom and ask him for help only tell you to do better next time and do your homework without giving any constructive opinions or actual assistance aviod him as a suicidal bomber for your grade the only good thing is attendance is not mandatory since attending his lecture or not makes no difference
12730,Andrew  Glennon,do not take this professor all his notes are word by word from the book not helpful at all assigns a lot of homework and then know how to answer questions about it
12731,Andrew  Glennon,well i got an a in and i recommend this teacher i recommend someone else.graded on exams he drops the final if you need to take and there is no else to take just wait a quarter and take someone else he goes over the material well but the tests are harder not recommended
12732,Andrew  Glennon,wow all this guy did was read the standard powerpoints all the material was online kept you till then took attendance was confused about some of the powerpoints stating that they were wrong abused the software on the school machines showed a girls email to everyone everyone in class ended up teaching themselves
12733,Andrew  Glennon,look im gonna be honest hes kind of weird yes but hes a pretty good prof his ability to teach is not what makes this class suck its his ability to grade he is an extremely hard grader and requires every decimal point to be correct as other users stated his tests are harder then material.if your not bad at math take.otherwise avoid
12734,Andrew  Glennon,exams throughout the quarter the lowest score dropped then a final exam weight was between the exams and final if the average of the was higher than the final if the final exam grade was higher than the then its for the exams and for the final i walked into the final with a average got an a in the class
12735,Andrew  Glennon,i agree his tests are totally harder than what he teaches in class and the homework he gives us
12736,Andrew  Glennon,he can teach the material alright teacher over all attendance is optional is not graded nor collected and grade comes from best grade of out of tests for and final for
12737,Andrew  Glennon,good teacher clear and and if you work hard get the material ture that kid of weird but lets face it no perfect gives quiz that counts for of over all grade and drops the lowest of the so the top three best would be counted
12738,Andrew  Glennon,very straightforward easy class no homework required stay up on homework to get a good grad though tests throughout the class tests include the midterm and final
12739,Andrew  Glennon,he is insane who cares if he has issues with himself he should not take it out on us bet money the one who posted those last two comments about himself please seek help glennon and get the hell out of depaul
12740,Andrew  Glennon,mr glennon does not help his students i know what these two posts below me are talking about they are trying to trick you to join the class because their is always so many open seats in his class glennon uses his students and constantly uses against students he does not like glennon is a predator stay away
12741,Carole  Myscofski,gives out lots of homework but makes the subject matter super interesting has flexible office hours and is willing to answer any questions you have nice to see someone so passionate about what they teach textbooks too expensive for her may term class
12742,Carole  Myscofski,one of the most genuinely nice and caring ladies ever met cares about the wellbeing of her students and how they are doing in the class yes she is a difficult grader but she makes you a much better writer go to her office hours show up to class and turn things in on time and you should have no problem getting a high b or a
12743,Carole  Myscofski,took her voodoo class that was an experience she assigns several page essays throughout the course an a research paper for a final she is nice but a little crazy she gets very excited about slavery without taking into account the ethnicity of her students lectures make an interesting subject incredibly boring not my major but got an a
12744,Carole  Myscofski,women religion and spirituality was one of the best classes i took my freshman year she is very sweet and insanely intelligent the classes include almost exclussively women but she really cultivated an interest in the subject for those not expecting to like it this is a great gen ed to take to fulfill your csi and global diversity flagsl
12745,Carole  Myscofski,intro to myths and rituals is one of my favorite classes prof myscofski is fair engaging and knows what she is talking about we watched star trek in class whether interested in the topic or not she presents the material well and the assignments are manageable
12746,Carole  Myscofski,professor myscofski is great very scholarly and professional but also fun to talk to very understanding and flexible if a problem with one of your assignments and more than willing to work with you to help you succeed in her class
12747,Carole  Myscofski,a sweet lady knows her stuff but boy is she tough spend hours and hours writing an essay go in and ask her about it have friends read it and get a b crap many people dont like her class and find it boring only a passion for the subject area can get you through the readings
12748,Carole  Myscofski,she has a great knowledge of the subject and is a very kind professor it was an amazingly interesting course paper assignments were difficult though and she is a tough grader but if you enjoy the material it is definitely worth taking a course from her
12749,Carole  Myscofski,tough on papers avoided difficult discussions sex etc all the interesting stuff she was afraid of the awesome exciting stuff we oculd have said awful for studies other subjects i hear better
12750,Carole  Myscofski,i love carol she made me laugh she tells you exactly what she wants from yuo in papers and really all she wants very straight forward about grading
12751,Carole  Myscofski,excellent teacher tries to scare you in the let her do itstick it out and it is not as tough as you think just do the workwhich is not that tough and you will get an a
12752,Carole  Myscofski,wonderful an easy grader if you give her what she wants as long as you follow the assignment be fine obvious to see that she knows what talking about and her enthusiasm comes through her lectures i would definatly take her class over again
12753,Carole  Myscofski,alright although i like some of the biases she showed in class it was always religion says women are bad and men are dominant blah blah blah it got old after a while but the course is easy she also offers extra credit opport
12754,Carole  Myscofski,all i have to say is eh take a class with her if you like the topic or need the credit not too bad not too good
12755,Carole  Myscofski,cm is great she loves her studies and it shows class is always lively she is tough on grading though so make the effort in your writings
12756,Carole  Myscofski,this class is a must for everyone it is wonderful and eye opening she is a hard grader on papers so make sure you work on them ahead of time and have her check them for you however she is very passionate about the topic and teaches well
12757,Carole  Myscofski,every person should take her studies course easy fun and informative she is really passionate about it be surprised how much you learn take it
12758,Carole  Myscofski,no comments
12759,Hammad  Siddiqi,not a bad teacher he pissed everyone off when he said he was giving us all extra credit i had totalled up quite a bit then one day came in to class and said he was giving us none and laughed about it
12760,Hammad  Siddiqi,very innovative and smart teacher good kooking too
12761,Nancy  Carnal,had nancy for plant physiology around and still remember her class what a great teacher the reviews that say she plays favorites are absolute garbage warm enthusiastic friendly supportive clear understandable lectures hard exams excellent
12762,Nancy  Carnal,lectures were horrible prefer reading the text than to keep up with her she keeps us in class way over lecture time we have other classes to attend not very good
12763,Nancy  Carnal,agree with others she favors some students over others her lectures are clear but not exactly like the book she goes into details with her experiences and knowledge it is good sometimes but bad when not relevant to exactly what to study for the exams overall an average professor
12764,Nancy  Carnal,very clear lectures you can tell professor enjoys teaching her subject and wants students to do well
12765,Nancy  Carnal,condescending willing to help at a certain point her lectures are very clear and straight forward that is about the only redeeming charactersisitcs favors certain students over others
12766,Nancy  Carnal,no comments
12767,Nancy  Carnal,no comments
12768,Nancy  Carnal,has her favorites her lectures are excellent she can be a bit condescending
12769,Nancy  Carnal,going in for office hours is very helpful she is a very friendly professor and enthusiastic about biology in depth analysis of the chemistry involved in biology occassional extra credit pop quizzes highly recommended
12770,Nancy  Carnal,nothing you cant handle
12771,Nancy  Carnal,nan is a great lecturer she really tries to get you to understand the material before she moves on near the end of the semester though it was a little rushed enthusiastic her exam questions are pretty easy if you understand and review the material she really cares about her students
12772,Nancy  Carnal,one of the best professors i have ever had.i wish more professors can be like her.her enthusiasm for the material and her desire to see her students succeed is evident to anyone who talks to her in sum a great professor you are lucky if you take bio with her
12773,Nancy  Carnal,obvious she has a passion for the materialeven if her students do not she is a good lecturer and really takes an interest in seeing that her students do welljust as long as you make the effort to take advantage of her helpfulness
12774,Nancy  Carnal,nan was one of the most helpful teachers i have ever had she went out of her way to make sure i passed the class
12775,Nancy  Carnal,i had her as an undergrad and a grad student she is very knowledgeable and very helpful seen her for a few years but she was sure nice on the eyes too
12776,Nancy  Carnal,no comments
12777,Brewster  Fitz,great professor he is nice and really knows his stuff he also has had so much experience in traveling the world and loves to tell stories all relevant to the work being done in class
12778,Brewster  Fitz,he looks kind of like a young einstein he was a good guy really nice and very passionate about his material but i know what was going on half the time he talked about a lot of stuff that had nothing to do with lecture i was ready to be out of that class
12779,Brewster  Fitz,he is weird and very animated he say much and sticks to his own opinion no one matters the tas were more educational
12780,Brewster  Fitz,the most incredible man he is an inspiration
12781,Brewster  Fitz,he is probably one of the worst teachers i have ever had his lectures were boring he rambled about irrelevant issues and if you went to see him in his office he acted like you were wasting his time i did okay in his class but he was almost hateful towards me and made the class unpleasant
12782,Brewster  Fitz,no comments
12783,Brewster  Fitz,i was never open to nonwestern lit but his enthusiasm and knowledge of the subject made me want to learn more and i enjoyed it
12784,Brewster  Fitz,if you think that he is egotistical or hard you should drop out now you have no hope of coming up with an original concept on your own and saying that he doesnt let you have your own opinions is catagorically incorrect that is exactly what he tries
12785,Brewster  Fitz,would almost go back to school to take a class of his again best there is
12786,Brewster  Fitz,fitz is a cool guy we called him wolfman jack because of that hoary mane of his those who think he is egotistical or has some crazy agenda are morons his only interest is in furthering the abilities of his students he was one of the most memorable knowledgable and interesting professors i have ever had the priviledge of studying under
12787,Brewster  Fitz,it was hard to understand what fitz was talking about but it was a fun class if you enjoy reading alot of books it is pretty much your ta who grades you not fitz
12788,Brewster  Fitz,an automaton that spits out postmodern buzzwords with enthusiasm he will relate to you his experience chatting with derrida whom along with foucault seem to be his intellectual idols nice guy but the intellectual atmosphere trapped in will make any class a terrible experience
12789,Brewster  Fitz,i was pretty interested in this class before i took it but this one spoiled it all for me he is very egotistical has his own agenda and will stick to it and will not let you explore your own ideas avoid him if you can you will regret taking this class it is helpful in no way at all a waste
12790,Brewster  Fitz,horrible horrible horrible egotistical knowitall
12791,Brewster  Fitz,overall he was energetic and interesting to listen to even though many of his theories are farfetched pertaining to the course his lectures dont really do much for you because the tests are essays over your opinions over themes in books
12792,Brewster  Fitz,the most interesting class ever taken and definitely the most interesting prof cares about the subject and students deeply also really fun in class sometimes acts out the stories
12793,Brewster  Fitz,two classes with fitz great teacher and fun lectures he really pulls the class into the lecture and discussion great guy and works with you
12794,Brewster  Fitz,took years of classes with fitz he is wonderful exciting and has a sexy head of hair
12795,Brewster  Fitz,very funny enthusiastic a bit excitable always interesting and has a passion for readings big fan as am i now that taken the course
12796,Brewster  Fitz,the reading assignments are sometimes boring but professor fitz always explains and is extremely nice and helpful he is very cute when reading to us because he gets very excited and into the story
12797,Constanza  Morales-Mair,boring books boring class not enough student involvement she talks for majority of class difficult quizes and expects a bit much avoid
12798,Constanza  Morales-Mair,the class is really boring she talks to fast and never explains what she wants from you a lot of reading and writing in this class be prepared for her to tear your paper apart she over analyzes everything she is definitely not a fair grader
12799,Constanza  Morales-Mair,the class really that hard though the books she chooses are boring kind of ditzy though and can be boring at times but she is a fair grader
12800,Constanza  Morales-Mair,she requires a lot from the students a lot of reading and writing even for a regular comp lit class however she is very nice and is a fair grader
12801,Constanza  Morales-Mair,reaquires too much writing for a class that is not even a writing intensive class
12802,Constanza  Morales-Mair,extremely boring give a lot of tests and reading has the ability to talk to herself in a class where everyone else is sleeping
12803,Margie  Brown,no comments
12804,Margie  Brown,if you agree with this professor you are guaranteed to fail the teaching of this course is not based on reality i agree dreadful course
12805,Margie  Brown,i graduated years ago i respect her determination yet be honest you disagree with her if you want to do well she simply give contract credit unless your opinions match her own i know of wrote lies f
12806,Margie  Brown,no comments
12807,Margie  Brown,this prof has tremendous personal experience and willingness to share it while we do not always agree she has my respect for believing and doing what she feels is right those who would criticize should walk just one measly little mile in her shoes
12808,Margie  Brown,go out and work in the field before telling other show to teach
12809,Margie  Brown,dreadful absolutely dreadful course
12810,Qiang  Cui,very hard but a good teacher accent but not too bad says right too much sometimes absent during his office hours but otherwise these were useful
12811,Qiang  Cui,he was an okay professor i agree there was really no point to go to lectures and most of the teaching was done in section if you can learn from the book then not that bad otherwise having a good ta helps i had jeanine batterton she was really helpful and i highly recommend her
12812,Qiang  Cui,i quit going to class and thats when i actually started learning what does that say
12813,Qiang  Cui,do not take this professor lectures were completely useless and make you feel so lost you are better off skipping them and using the time for learning the material on your own completely useless professor
12814,Qiang  Cui,qc is a terrible lecturer so boring and all i did was go on my ipod touch the whole time really nice outside of class though tests are so annoying but i ended up getting and a in the class because i did really well on the final avoid him compared to other profs much harder
12815,Qiang  Cui,qc can be difficult to follow in lecture occasionally quantum is definitely his specialty but he is a nice intelligent guy is organized and helpful when you ask his tests and expectations are very fair all mc average if you can use the book well or have a good basic knowledge of chem worry about it do fine
12816,Qiang  Cui,q.c is a nice guy who explain concepts the best however he does try to answer questions and he is approachable the exams can be somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be fine since the class average on exams is around i would recommend him if you are able to understand just by reading the textbook
12817,Qiang  Cui,switch professors now qc is an intelligent person but he cannot teach this material at all lectures are absolutely useless read the book and pray
12818,Qiang  Cui,bad professor for chem do not take this course from qc he is brilliant but can not teach the fundamentals of chemistry he wants to be teaching quantum stuff not what an element atom or molecule is
12819,Qiang  Cui,lectures are often confusing reading the book is basically essential to getting a good grade exams are ok but you get partial credit as they are multiple choice good and bad
12820,Qiang  Cui,he is horrible
12821,Qiang  Cui,cui a bad guy at all he clearly has knowledge but dumb him self down to teach exams are not that bad i got an ab on the first two and an a on the third exam unfortuneately no curve but he does make a reasonable scale as an and up will be an a depending on class average which he wants to be a b
12822,Qiang  Cui,unable to teach chem a lot of people in my section stopped attending lecture all together because it is just so completely useless he seems to mention the key concepts in lecture but forgets to explain and teach the main concepts better hope for a great ta
12823,Qiang  Cui,professor cui q.c is very unclear in lecture and is incapable of completely answering questioins i would reccommend not taking his class exams are not curved if you are unfortunate enough to have him pray you have a good t.a i reccommend brian parker
12824,Qiang  Cui,horrible as said early he is unable to dumb himself down to teach he may be better to teach higher level chem classes quantum chem is obviously his passion but he is a terrible teacher for he never explains things thoroughly and his tests are extremely difficult and then confused when many students fail
12825,Qiang  Cui,absolutely useless seriously he should stick to research i am barely staying afloat in a subject i have no interest in because i have a decent ta but if not so lucky be prepared to teach yourself chemistry btw i counted rights in one of his most recent lectures keeps you awake in lecture
12826,Qiang  Cui,good guy explain concepts well
12827,Qiang  Cui,good guy but a horrible chem professor he does not tie concepts together i recommend him to future students brilliant man but unable to dumb things down
12828,Qiang  Cui,probably the worst teacher ever had
12829,Qiang  Cui,he was not very helpful and is not recommended as a teacher for chem
12830,Eugenia  Malitsky,professor malitsky is an excellent teacher for trigonometry the way she teaches is easy to follow and is and i am able to follow up with the lecture easily in the textbook she does not take short cuts in demonstrating problems which i like because the little math errors are easy to miss with shortcuts
12831,Eugenia  Malitsky,a very empathetic instructor she pays attention to questions and feedback she wants you to succeed do your best and be fine
12832,Eugenia  Malitsky,this professor was amazing at explaining how to derive the equations she was teaching us she not only explained why we needed to learn the material but applied it to real life if ever had officer hours with her find she truly wants you to learn the material and will help you in any way she can
12833,Eugenia  Malitsky,mrs malitsky does not explain anything in class just teaches out of the textbook word for word the exams are ridiculously hard and the examples in the class lecture and homework do not help you prepare for them unless a math genius and know what doing i recommend taking this class
12834,Eugenia  Malitsky,professor malitsky was helpful with homework classes during lectures but her lectures were verbatim from the textbook so when i attended lectures i did not need to read from the textbook i did the minimum work for the class and scored the highest score on the final the material hard but the teacher is a little boring but she is nice
12835,Eugenia  Malitsky,professor lectures are read straight out of the textbook but she cover everything in the required textbook so if you go to class you need to read the textbook i would suggest going to class because she does help with the online homework assignments not a bad professor but her polish accent takes a while to get used to
12836,Eugenia  Malitsky,professor malitsky is not a very effective teacher there is no discussion section for this class and all her lectures are problems straight out of the book she is also not friendly at all all of the exams that go along with this class are a lot harder than any examples she does in lecture and are very hard to be well prepared for
12837,Eugenia  Malitsky,incredible teacher has a great sense of humor and a true sense to ensure her students are learning material curves and other grades are very fair but you have to work for your grade
12838,Eugenia  Malitsky,long boring lectures and exams that accurately represent what was taught in the homework as well as in lecture however the exams are heavily curved
12839,Eugenia  Malitsky,this class is unnecessarily hard because i knew that some of the ways we were taught could be much easier just by explain a different way to solve it i felt like she chose the hardest most challenging way to solve every single problem and that was the way we had to learn how to solve it this class could have been much easier
12840,Eugenia  Malitsky,teacher does not realize when students do not understand and just ends up moving on to another problem or example i feel like there is no such thing as time to sit rest and think about what we just learnedthere is no break time it is just go go go and if you listening intently for even seconds you will miss a great deal of information
12841,Eugenia  Malitsky,lectures are not interesting and she goes through the textbook word for word and does all of the textbook example problems she takes homework questions and works out all of the problems you ask her to the exams are much more difficult than the content she actually teaches
12842,Eugenia  Malitsky,at times difficult to understand with her accent but after a while you get used to it and her not too big of a problem all she does is read the book word for word she rushes through the problems as if we should understand them already she does help with homework once a week which is helpful
12843,Eugenia  Malitsky,i did not like this class way too hard for a basic math class lectures were so boring and confusing she just did problems the whole time which help me definitely the worst class and probably worst professor had at uw so far seems like a nice lady but tests were so hard and were nothing like her practice tests
12844,Eugenia  Malitsky,i was left sitting in lectures looking around and wondering if i was on a different planet a pointless waste of time tests were completely different than homework quizzes and pass exams i feel i did not lean anything and it therefore set me up for failure in math for the rest of my life
12845,Eugenia  Malitsky,super boring super dull you really need to go to class except when an exam everything else is literally straight from the book pretty much reading it aloud to us word for word
12846,Eugenia  Malitsky,to do well on exams you have to know the concepts well she does a good job of explaining in lecture and provides good examples a very straightforward professor and the exams are fair
12847,Eugenia  Malitsky,nearly everything she does in class appears to be taken right from the textbook she teaches by simply doing example after example and really explain the concept by talking but rather does lots of examples in order for you to understand which bad if you study the tests and quizzes can be quite easy
12848,Eugenia  Malitsky,i struggled at first with math but quickly learned what she wanted do the homework twice once a few days before the quiz and the night before trust me worth it the midterm final questions are kind of odd you get to use a sheet of notes on the finals overall not a bad professor but not a great one
12849,Eugenia  Malitsky,not even worth it to go to lecture she simply does the exercises and problems from the book and does extensive pointless proofs i found it easier to just read the textbook and teach myself pray for a good ta
12850,Ricki  Heller,totally unhelpful and difficult to reason with overall very poor quality professor very disappointing considering the high quality of seneca other professors
12851,Ricki  Heller,she was a very good and a kind teacher she used to communicate with the students very well and is a good teacher to take for any psychology courses
12852,Ricki  Heller,good teacher but hard marker if you take an online course with her do not slack off cause you will get a d or fail do the assignments on time and you will be fine
12853,Ricki  Heller,oops i meant an excellent teacher not an excellent course lol
12854,Ricki  Heller,what are you people talking about an excellent course and an easy marker i learned many cool new things in her class do well if you do your research and always check structure grammar and spelling before handing something in
12855,Ricki  Heller,i took the online course so i know what like in person but as far as i got to know her i can say that she was willing to help and made the course requirements quite clear she was really tough on marks overall say ok
12856,Ricki  Heller,dr heller is one of the best professors i had during my study at seneca college she is an icon seneca should be proud of ramin keshani
12857,Ricki  Heller,if you have her on your timetable better be dropping the course or change b4 too late
12858,Ricki  Heller,if you white she help you and what college prof marx attendance
12859,Ricki  Heller,she has an obsession with being awkward but i guess she is ok
12860,Ricki  Heller,courses taught are very boring and structured poorly learn more alone
12861,Ricki  Heller,too hard of a marker
12862,Ricki  Heller,your lessons were outdated by atleast a decade please do some real research
12863,Ricki  Heller,marks for attendance weak
12864,Ricki  Heller,no comments
12865,Ricki  Heller,very hard marker but you will learn alot excellent teacher
12866,Ricki  Heller,no comments
12867,Ricki  Heller,complete idot and should be out of here
12868,Younghe  Kim Park,went through lectures too fast funny teacher tough grader half the class is gone midway into the semester need to do hw and attend tutoring
12869,Younghe  Kim Park,prof goes though lectures extremely quick and easily left behind if test were extremely hard and hard to understand
12870,Younghe  Kim Park,she teaches very fast but if you attend all of her lectures you will be fine for her stat class there are quizzes tests and then a final be sure to review your to make sure they were graded correctly because her ta this year marked several things wrong that were not overall she is very funny and tries to make it fun
12871,Younghe  Kim Park,a funny professor and will make you laugh but her teaching skills good she moves really fast and cover all the material you see in the textbook her grading is really strict if you take this class consider going to tutoring for extra help
12872,Younghe  Kim Park,the worst math teacher ever had her tests are insanely hard and your grades are solely based on that picky when it comes to grading tries to be funny and relatable skip class or you know anything
12873,Younghe  Kim Park,really bad at explaining things rude when you ask for help even during office hours
12874,Younghe  Kim Park,love dr kim park she is very straight to the point there are absolutely no surprises in her class very nice grader too surprisingly a funny professor too you just have to catch her in the right moment use text homework is online very prompt grader i was worried about this class but she made it very basic and easy to understand
12875,Younghe  Kim Park,dr kim park teaches extremely fast she is willing to go over problems multiple times with a little sass till you get it she is available during office hours and is helpful there too exams are straight forward and mostly from the no surprises also really relatable exams final homework pts provides formulas
12876,Younghe  Kim Park,tests quizzes she teaches very fast but as long as you go over your notes again you should be fine i got an a on every quiz and test you do not need the textbook the example problems she gives during class are very similar to the ones on the tests and quizzes you need her notes to do well so go to class class is points total
12877,Younghe  Kim Park,her tests are tough but luckily she curves grade is based off quizzes and tests i would recommend you take her she truly cares about her students passing and understanding the content
12878,Younghe  Kim Park,i would not recommend park for people who struggle with math she speeds through problems assuming everyone is following along tests are whatever still failed the class because your grade is solely based on and final this prof is great people who are good at math or have taken stats before
12879,Younghe  Kim Park,dr kim park is my absolute favorite professor funny makes the class super interesting very helpful and she makes sure that be able to understand the materials and pass the class having her as my professor was such an honor lectures are fun make sure you show up on time and miss class do great no textbook use
12880,Younghe  Kim Park,lectures are essential to passing she goes a bit fast but if you do the homework that she assigns optional but useful then the tests will go smoothly always available to help during office hours she gives extra credit by adding to of the tests that the class as a whole did bad on she do make ups so miss a test day
12881,Younghe  Kim Park,like a normal college professor your grade depends solely on quizzes and tests but worry probably curve of them the book is helpful if new to stats especially if you want an a but she collect hw calculator is also very helpful since you can just calculate the answers on it for tests and she lets you saved me tbh
12882,Younghe  Kim Park,only three quizzes and three tests homework is not collected she goes over material fast but teaches clearly go to class gives a lot of extra credit take her if you are prenursing one of the better stats professors hard work but an a is definitely attainable
12883,Younghe  Kim Park,a great professor pay attention if you taken stats but if you did then pretty much review i suggest going to tutoring and do the homework it really helps with practice go to lectures important tests are easy if you know what doing i suggest her as a stats professor no midterm cheatsheet for final easy
12884,Younghe  Kim Park,she is so funny easy class if you show up and pay attention the homework really necessary the quizzes and exams are more similar to the format of her in class examples and same quizzes
12885,Younghe  Kim Park,this class was really challenging for me she is a good professor but moves really quickly so i recommend going to tutoring if you want to pass the class three quizzes three tests and a cumulative final most people would get csfs on the exams she curves the class at the end knowing that most people either drop or will fail
12886,Younghe  Kim Park,i warn you you will pass as long as you take notes her are pretty much the examples that she uses on her lectures i also had her in a lh so be sure to sit up front stats is hard overall but she tries her best to organize everything and sometimes curves the tests she gives homework to do but collect calculator must
12887,Younghe  Kim Park,applied math major here def one of the best math profs taken at csulb i would jump at any opportunity to take her again great professor and person
12888,Yen Lu  Wong,creative leadership seminar absolutely aweful class was tense and stressfull as she was always yelling at peoplein front of the class making people cry and over all being very offensive take anything the wrong way and start yelling at the class didnt learn anything especially not about creativity or leadership
12889,Yen Lu  Wong,she needs a new career some psych help or both she bases grades on whether or not she personally likes you her classes do really stupid things and have structure she yelled at me in front of everyone for things like bringing a newspaper to class wearing heels and mispronouncing some random word f up your college career with this one
12890,Yen Lu  Wong,while she seems to have a genuine interest in the success of her students she seem to know how to help her students her expressing concerns felt more like nagging and less about trying to help me in the class the class is dangerously unstructured and it is often difficult to gauge what she expects from the students
12891,Yen Lu  Wong,yen lu is wise and keeps on track praise comes at unexpected times analysis of subject is very insightfull she seems a bit sad or at least she is wearing a mask the core person is a caring wonderful teacher stirs the pot gets the most out of students who respond and show up
12892,Yen Lu  Wong,really nice professor and the class was a blast watched a lot of flicks some were really boring and some were really good a la to live class favorite class was fun and the teaching style was different this class was actually advance topics in asian cinema fall
12893,Yen Lu  Wong,really nice and pretty approachable her husband passed away during the semester so she took a month leave so the class slowed down and we really learn anything however i felt that i bonded the students in the class which is what muse wants you to do very helpful
12894,Yen Lu  Wong,worst teacher i have ever had do not take a chance in taking her course after the last day to add she is a different person
12895,Yen Lu  Wong,during the course she will pick favorites she isnot openminded and do not i repeat do not miss any papers she will dislike you and if she puts see me on her paper see her or she will dislike u even more and will give you a bad grade towards the end
12896,Yen Lu  Wong,the most horrible teacher ever.you never know when she will lose her temper and start screaming at you for any dumb reason.is rarely available for appointments if she is then she is either late or wants you to get the hell out of her office asap
12897,Yen Lu  Wong,if she likes you got it made if not in for it get too close or make you do something for her never known someone to delegate all of their resposibilities as much as her she do anything learn how to say
12898,Yen Lu  Wong,this artist should not be teaching or advising students she should be doing art
12899,Yen Lu  Wong,she sucks drop her class now
12900,Yen Lu  Wong,very difficult to follow inconssistent and unclear she is not very openminded wich contradicts what she represents
12901,Yen Lu  Wong,great teacher if you just listen and do the work you are almost guaranteed an a very good teacher
12902,Yen Lu  Wong,move foward and never look back you will be making one of the biggest mistakes of you life if you even consider her as a candidate you will never get a green sheet she is highly inconsistant and unfair you will struggle dont do it
12903,Yen Lu  Wong,lacks in teaching codeing
12904,Yen Lu  Wong,creative process seminar somewhat easy a few papers i think there was a final
12905,Joe  Murdico,a great teacher i had lots of fun in his class he drops your lowest quiz and test only one essay is required his lectures basically cover everything test you on i barely looked at the textbook all semester i would most definitely take a psych class with him again
12906,Joe  Murdico,attendance is mandatory i missed a couple of his classes which resulted in my missing his pop quizzes let you retake them assigns essay readings are important makes tricky quizzes a nice guy but i take a class from him again
12907,Joe  Murdico,class was good and if i studied more would have done better very nice teacher who really cares kinda hot too with a great personality show up each class and you will do well yeah the book is boring but thats prob why he lectures like he does he makes it interesting
12908,Joe  Murdico,nice guy but old school wastes time transferring lecture notes on the blackboard when he could simply use the overhead one easy paper but petty points deducted for grammar etc very rigid with grading no extra credit offered if borderline a he will not give you credit so b it is most other would give you the a for participating
12909,Joe  Murdico,took this class in spring of usually i hate night classes and anything with a three hour lecture but he was good about making the class interesting and ended class if he finished early almost everything is gone over in lecture with just a few book readings to reinforce the topic there is one paper but no big deal
12910,Joe  Murdico,great professor straightforward class and easy to achieve an a complaint he uses a very dry textbook as a psy prof who no doubt took a course on learning should know better than almost anyone to use a book at least somewhat interesting
12911,Joe  Murdico,if you have the opportunity to take him do it his class is more than interesting and his tests are made to be passed take good notes read the book and you will get the a he explains everything prior to tests and final the pop are to make sure you are always studying great guy and great course
12912,Joe  Murdico,love this class and teacher is so nice puts everything into perspective he is very clear and very fair quizzes drops tests drops one paper and a final class is lecture based so showing up is important but he leaves it up to you would take another class with him any day favorite teacher at moorpark so far
12913,Joe  Murdico,love him so nice and helpful and after having classes all day he made this hour long class as fun as possible he was so nice to everyone and really cared about his students and making sure everyone understood very easy to get an a without much work i actually feel like i learned stuff in this class that remember take him
12914,Joe  Murdico,he is not only a wonderful professor but a great man his class is super fair and almost easy if you take good notes and attend class he is very friendly and loves to engage with the class he will do whatever he can to help would definitely recommend him take good notes get an a easily
12915,Joe  Murdico,class is very fair tests are meant to be passed drops a test and quizzes take good notes and you will get an a
12916,Joe  Murdico,nice teacher with a very positive attitude his expectations are very clear grades on a fair point system simple to understand makes the class a breeze i do recommend
12917,Joe  Murdico,was always scared to take a hour class but joe makes the time fly he has interesting to engage with his students and encourage their intellect random quizzes help to refresh material but he is very helpful that he gives you wonderful study outlines only bummer is that he was too nice rude students cell phones always going off
12918,Joe  Murdico,great class very thorough teaching if you attend class you will do well not too bad on the eyes as well his personality is great and very helpful take him
12919,Joe  Murdico,great teacher hes talks alot but is very funny explains things very well have a problem repeating himself or answering questions.very nice and helpful not to mention his tests are super easy i never studied because he always reviews the material hes going to test you on just make sure you undestand it highly reccomend him
12920,Joe  Murdico,great teacher very easy tests and quizzes barely even studied lectures and notes are clear very straightfoward pretty funny guy too
12921,Joe  Murdico,although i got a c in the class i must say he was a remarkable teacher nice helpful intuitive and efficient more professors should be like murdico
12922,Joe  Murdico,great teacher i had him once a week for like hour periods but he managed to make the class really interesting tests were pretty simple plus he drops your lowest score along with a few quizzes
12923,Joe  Murdico,i had classes with him intro abnormal awesome really friendly encourages questions always happy to explain questions even during tests funny and makes class interesting he totally made me want to major in psychology i suggest attending every class because he sometimes has pop super easy take murdico
12924,Joe  Murdico,very nice and very understanding class is all lecture but i never got bored he takes the time to explain everything you need to know for the tests six quizzes drops two three tests drops one and a final there is a short paper but it is fairly simple i taking him again next semester he is great
12925,Paul  Kjellberg,his class is pretty simple but if you want to get an a in the class you really have to try you have to read the assignments assigned because he gives daily online quizes visit him during office hours and help you with writing your papers
12926,Paul  Kjellberg,read read read philosophy wether you agree or not its up to you to make the most out of this class in philosophy nothing is considered wrong except you need to explain great class lots of fun
12927,Paul  Kjellberg,great teacher easy and wants you to succeed he makes the course very interesting and will like you if he sees that you are putting in the effort necessary
12928,Paul  Kjellberg,he is a very talented and committed teacher lots of fun too
12929,Paul  Kjellberg,paul rocks i cannot believe that none of the other raters have commented on the hotness factor if reading translations from the ancient chinese it makes a big difference also very nice elucidation of the implicit tension between confucianist ritualism and hegelian dialectics thank you paul
12930,Paul  Kjellberg,no comments
12931,Paul  Kjellberg,he illuminated modern philosophy taught me how to teach myself makes school fun and challenging for all levels of intelligence and aptitude simultaneously and soes all of this with a kind of stoner demeanor that makes him all the more approachable everyone can and should take from paul
12932,Paul  Kjellberg,not easy but not the point you learn so much if you put in the effort
12933,Paul  Kjellberg,he is a great teacher and probably the only good philosophy professor we have another surprising thing is that he makes the final paper fun anyone at all interested in philosophy should take a course with him
12934,Paul  Kjellberg,best professor at wc some of these reviews have been written by morons clouded by ideology exactly what pk avoids best and his calm collected manner opens your mind to a world of thought beyond what you can prepare for so brilliant that he illuminated hegel one of the worst writers of all time with absolute clarity reading is intense but not overly demanding very good about assigning only sections that were essential take paul k especially cent phil even if your only ph class
12935,Paul  Kjellberg,unclear unstructured horrible professor very intelligent but unable to express ideas to students
12936,Paul  Kjellberg,no comments
12937,Paul  Kjellberg,he is one of the most amazing people ever
12938,Paul  Kjellberg,extremely intelligent with valuable insight understanding lisitens to students and actually takes their opinions ect into accout very thought provoking basically the antithesis of switzer
12939,Paul  Kjellberg,no comments
12940,Paul  Kjellberg,thought provoking helpful grading includes incite shows interest in students respects reasoned arguments whether or not he agrees he is not at all radical this coming from a republican answering the charges of another rater
12941,Paul  Kjellberg,no comments
12942,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,lets you know exactly what will be on the upcoming tests as long as you stay until the end of class extra credit is easy things like go on a hike or draw and label a cell a great instructor
12943,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,dilek sanverwang is one of the dopest teachers in the game some would argue she is the goat in biology i suck at bio an english major but i got on the first midterms cuz her lectures are thorough if you look her up on the coc website a pic of her with an owl on her hand lookin like a straight g post again at the end
12944,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,honestly it all depends on the student not good at biology at all but reading the book actually helped a lot because i grasp anything while i was in lecture there are midterms which are way better than just the one because be chapters at a time rather than chapters for only big accumulative midterm take her
12945,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,professor dilek is a great professor she is very caring and always ready to help she provides study guides and review sessions when possible he has mid term tests she does offer extra credit that involves going on a field trip i would definitely recommend her she is great you regret taking her
12946,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,the professor explains and lectures on material in a way that can be easily understood she is more than fair with questions grading and extra credit gives great handouts for note taking
12947,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,awesome teacher this is not an easy class where you show up and get a grade you will have to work for it she offers ec and study guides for the test which are essential show up pay attention take notes work hard complete the work and study for the exams did not need the textbook her notes and power points were detailed enough
12948,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,she is such a great teacher she literally helps you out with anything you get and makes it easier to understand she gives you all the reviews before exams and finals they can be hard though if you study very nice and helpful teacher would definitely recommend her
12949,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,i loved this class and this professor it was a hybrid class which meant we only came in once a week for labs and learned the lecture material ourselves i was pretty worried about the labs and dissections but they were actually pretty easy the lecture material too hard to grasp if you read the book great class she offers extra credit
12950,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,i thought bio was going to be very boring but she managed to make it so much fun to the point that i was looking forward to her class lab she gives easy hw she will tell you everything on the tests will have little reviews willing to stay after class to help out super sweet her lectures are awesome would take again
12951,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,very nice teacher liked her a lot would definitely recommend taking the class
12952,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,professor was awesome i took the hybrid class lecture online monday lab only the test can be difficult but if you do the homework and the study guides online you will pass make sure to show up and do the extra credit one of the best teachers ever had and one of the easiest going and understanding professors i know thanks professor
12953,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,i have never been able to understand this subject until i took her class she offers extra credit questions on exams making it much easier to get a higher score very clear and straight forward and is always willing to help if you go to her for it overall you could not ask for a better professor highly recommended
12954,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,super great teacher and knows what talking about and super nice when it comes to asking for help she is always is there to help when i had questions and was the nicest person to help you understand i did take the hybrid class and yes the class went super fast and its a lot of work and studying but she goes over the whole test most it helps
12955,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,an amazing professor as long as you study her notes do fine on the tests
12956,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,amazing professor i failed tests my fault for not studying and i still passed the class with an a she gives extra credit and makes biology easy to understand definitely would recommend anyone to take her
12957,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,prof dilek was awesome she teaches botany in a way that is easy to learn supplementing her lectures with videos and relevant hw assignments she offers extra credit and puts some into each test too just study her study guides and you will be fine labs were fun and creative would take her for any class she offers
12958,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,our class was a at first those lectures were rough but dilek is really passionate she makes jokes shows us videos keeps class interesting dilek accommodates to her students i was really struggling but she took the extra time to additionally help me adjust to my learning style dilek is an amazing professor
12959,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,best professor ever had makes the class extremely easy to to do extra credit throughout the semester you have to go to class because it is a lab class obvious her lectures are super easy to comprehend and remember she does review before every exam so its impossible to fail she posts the textbook outlines on bb
12960,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,she is an amazing professor who goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material take her over any other professor i ended up with a b but only because i study nor did i take the small quizzes important the quizzes really add up
12961,Dilek  Sanver-Wang,i loved her class i was very engaged throughout the entire semester the class format is very straight forward and she gives some extra credit the gives review sessions before each test which are very helpful i highly recommend her for any class
12962,Cindy  Williams,this professor is in her year and treats her students as graders but she helps with your test grades no need to take notes because the test info is not from her notes just the book she will be a good teacher one day
12963,Cindy  Williams,this professor is extremely difficult the material is not covered well all i can say to anyone who takes her is good luck to you
12964,Cindy  Williams,whatever you do take her class there are no tests to even see if your understanding the material just homework and the occasional quiz which are just like the of grade and final exam of grade going to have to drop her class and never gotten below a b in a class
12965,Cindy  Williams,yes please never take this professor for econ unless you want to fail or enjoy challenges she is soo hard to understand with that really thick accent and she makes econ harder than it is do not take her
12966,Cindy  Williams,horrible teacher she answer questions very well and takes forever to reply to emails
12967,Cindy  Williams,no comments
12968,Cindy  Williams,she is very hard to understand just take notes and ask her to repeat things if you understand i took her for a summer semester and she flew through the information however she did give a really good midterm and final review study it made a b
12969,Cindy  Williams,very difficult to understand teaches as if we should all be experts in economics midterm and final exam awful
12970,Cindy  Williams,this professor should not be teaching at a community college she is extremely rude and favors past students you only have a midterm and a final which are so complex that it would take a rocketscientist to figure them out whatever you do dont take her
12971,Cindy  Williams,nor easy to understand writting on the board answer questions if she thinks you should know.treats students as subordinates first quiz equivelent to a final exam before it is taught she thinks teaching is telling you something.no method
12972,Cindy  Williams,hard as a diamond i hope atleast someone passes her final exam
12973,Cindy  Williams,she is not helpful at all she is not easy to understand either
12974,Cindy  Williams,bad teacher midterm is after the drop date hard to understand she is always minutes late to class and then takes smoke breaks right in the middle of her lecture hard to follow funny lady just not good at explaining economics
12975,Phyllis  Hirsch,great prof who took the time to speak to students available in office or by phone or email
12976,Phyllis  Hirsch,dr hirsch your so cool i loved your class it was easy to understand and the tests were not only mind boggling they were fun because they were soo hard i love you for making me learn
12977,Phyllis  Hirsch,teacher from hell everyday in her class is like torture to your brain this teacher gives so much work end up going nuts cmon not all of us are geniuses and scientists were just taking anatomy as a prereq if ur a nerd take this class ut if ur an average b student avoid her
12978,Phyllis  Hirsch,tuff teacher but she wants u to learn if ur lazy and are not willing to study and learn the material do not take this class it is hard so do not blame teacher for ur lazyness
12979,Phyllis  Hirsch,very hard professor to get an a make work hard to pass her class students at the beginning of the semester downt to sudents if you care about your grade dont take her class
12980,Phyllis  Hirsch,this professor is the worst experience of my life she sucks for any of you majoring in science do not take her class its a wate of time she does not care and is not willing to help to top it off she is not a morning person so beware she will confuse the brains out of you and make your life a living hell in the process
12981,Phyllis  Hirsch,the first thing is that she talk fast in lecture trying rush no help must write almost endless cycle of lab report do not say anything and expect u no u can try to kiss her butt but i wouldnt when u look confused during lecture dont ask she gonna does it look like to u if i had known better i would drop the class week
12982,Phyllis  Hirsch,suppose to learn and not to be more confused this teacher blows
12983,Phyllis  Hirsch,dr hirsch is a nice professor despite hideous remarks students have made they have not taken time to communicate with her thus they r lost in the material topics you really have work hard in her class succeed especially when most students r planning apply professional school cv personal statement r required for a reason
12984,Phyllis  Hirsch,dr hirsch is a busy professor she gives lots of homework but read study its possible get an a in her class do all the hmwk keep track of all your grades do not miss class she comes off as mean or snippy but a nice lady if u want an a in her class work for it pay attn study guides read all chapters extra credit oppty
12985,Phyllis  Hirsch,this teacher seems easy at first but you should take it from all the students that had before run the other way when you hear or see her name for a class she will leave you confused and wanting to fall asleep in the first min of class this teacher even run the experiments right and her supplementary hour is just crap
12986,Phyllis  Hirsch,if you want to save stress in your life do not take dr hirsch shes the worst teacher ive ever had she should retired already shes a pain in the ass who doesnt care about her students just her check she gives ou too much hw and her test are just pathetic so hard and you will have and her semester no kidding avoid stress
12987,Phyllis  Hirsch,she is the worst teacher in elac that i ever had she is not clear at all you will never know what is she doing do not take her with any class
12988,Phyllis  Hirsch,not a good teacher she gives out a lot of reading assignments and they take at least hours to do and at the end they are only worth pts and she is always deducting pts for stupid reasons she was also absent a lot and her and personal statements are a waste of time she is not a patient person and she is just not worth the time of day
12989,Phyllis  Hirsch,this is a bad teacher she is so bitter and cranky you even ask her a question her getting mad dose not try to explain anything and is absent during the fall semester alot she needs to retire and not make this subject such a nightmare for students anatomy is very interesting and is the core for nursing students look4anotherschool or tech
12990,Phyllis  Hirsch,not a good teacher for the subject the material is hard enough and strenous as it is now add monotony to the lectures and outdated handounts i know a hard subject but if she so unbearably boring maybe more people could stay and pass her class
12991,Phyllis  Hirsch,dr hirsch is a busy professor she gives lots of homework but read study its possible get an a in her class do all the hmwk keep track of all your grades do not miss class she comes off as mean or snippy but a nice lady if u want an a in her class work for it pay attn study guides read all chapters extra credit oppty
12992,Phyllis  Hirsch,never take her class that is too much work not much she absents a lot you will not learn much.people skips her class a lot the class start as people now there are only around left it is a waste of time trust me
12993,Phyllis  Hirsch,the materials is hard no matter what but the way she teaches and the material she gave out during class is horrible not much help during lab avoid
12994,Phyllis  Hirsch,this was the worst teacher i ever had people would sleep during her lecture i recommend to not take this teacher cause a lot of people would fail
12995,James  Chambers,go ahead and ignore any review before as changed his style tests matter grade wise study the powerpoints supplement with the book if needed do the hw go to class ask questions so he knows who you are and the a is yours if you understand the pathways then the final is easy his tests were easier than
12996,James  Chambers,dr chambers is an awesome professor dr chambers just made it easier to learn biochem but you still have to study alot anyone who complains about him was just being lazy and wanted an easy a i just took a practice mcat and scored with no studying or practice because he makes you learn and understand not just memorize
12997,James  Chambers,horrible class
12998,James  Chambers,dr chambers is very knowledgeable passionate and funny i took this course in fall because the other easy professors were taken and i am glad i did i been studing for the mcat and this class made the biochemical section a breeze it was hard for sure but worth it make sure you show up to every class
12999,James  Chambers,content is the grading system that will leave you confusedyour tests during the semester mean nothing but you should still aim to do well hw is about effort not score finish it all attendance is extremely important and the final will make or break you i learned a ton and mcat prep is easier having taken this course
13000,James  Chambers,exams were extremely difficult questions free response no curve i would not recommend this professor very fast course
13001,James  Chambers,tough class but as long as you go to class and do all the homework questions you should be fine he was the most available professor to offer help with any questions i had at utsa study sessions every sunday afternoon and every day after class
13002,James  Chambers,i learned a lot in this class honestly if a premed you need this class he teaches on the med school level he is hard but if you put in work you will make an a he had sunday sessions and after class coffee sessions no professor puts in this much effort to help his students go to everything make you get to know him and live
13003,James  Chambers,this was one of the most confusing classes his handwriting is impossible to read and his lectures were all over the place basically memorize all the amino acid structures and know all of the pathways and cycles backward and forward
13004,James  Chambers,avoid at all costs this guys grading system is the most messed up thing ive ever seen the first two tests are nothing compared to the final during class he went to europe for some reason and gave us lectures to learn on our own whenever you try to ask a question in class he ignores you unless you yell at him
13005,James  Chambers,grade is made up of quizzes midterm and quizzes usually questions and you only have seconds to answer before he moves on i read and understood all chapters and sections and worked problems at the end of the book never failed a class if not doing well place false hope in the final i failed bad
13006,James  Chambers,dr chambers is a good professor but you have to work really hard in his class you must go to class to understand the topics he wants you to know then take his information and spend a lot of time researching and learning it yourself the final is extremely difficult but if you kept up during the class and studied really hard you can do well
13007,James  Chambers,well i make chambers sound as easy as the previous person but doing good in his class is completely possible made an a on both tests and final i read all the the probs at the end of the chapters going to class is a must i never missed a single class and had great notes to constantly review it
13008,James  Chambers,honestly a great professor not bad at all all you have to do is show up to his class and listen what he teaches in class is whats gonna be on the test study his notes and read the sections he assigns in the book i got an on the first test and a on the second havent taken the final yet to get an a just understand the material
13009,James  Chambers,be ready to work but not impossible class is mandatory if you want to do good he skips around and picks and chooses stuff in the later chapters and if your not there you will be studying the entire book i got an a on the first test b on the second if you get an a on the final thats what you get for the class even if you got
13010,James  Chambers,i would make dr chambers a required professor to take if you plan on going to medical school his approach will teach you what to expect when you get there dr chambers is very demanding but can teach you a lot if you put in the work an a student that made a c in his class but i received a lot of knowledge and suggest him often
13011,James  Chambers,stay away from this prof i am an a student and made a c in his class u dont know what ur grade is in the class the entire time u can make on both his midterms and make a c he pulls the grades out of his bum do not take
13012,James  Chambers,he teaches the framework but tests over everything this class required more out of class time than any other class i have had hours so yielded a c would not recommend i asked where conference hours were held and got yelled at in on the syllabus it and he apologize just called me irresponsible
13013,James  Chambers,trust him he said kept saying not to worry about the first two tests cause if you get an a on the final then you get an a in class only problem where did that final come from study everything and for every test
13014,James  Chambers,well they dont call him chainsaw chambers for nothing not very clear on what he wants you to study he emphasizes not using the book and only listening to him but his notes can be kind of confusing got a on the first test a on the test and a on final walked away with a c class averages were similar to those grades
13015,Yousif  Shamoo,in terms of research he is very cutthroat he will do anything for grant money to beat out his competitors even if it means playing unfairly not personal just business great professor in biochem though
13016,Yousif  Shamoo,very nice guy pretty funny as well great to talk to about grad schools and the like if what you need yes he makes you memorize the amino acids but get over it the class is interesting and still say more conceptually based than memorization based especially compared to evil bios tests are challenging but it was nice to actually be challenged on a test and get a chance to show what i learned
13017,Yousif  Shamoo,a nice guy and pretty good at lecturing tests are too hard for the material he presents visit him in the office take his class
13018,Yousif  Shamoo,incredibly hard material and too much memorization for my comfort but not the fault
13019,Yousif  Shamoo,good guy i got screwed on the curve and he help me out but i still think he is a good guy and a good teacher sure if you went to him for help be helpful i just know for sure
13020,Yousif  Shamoo,great professor who forces certain things to be memorized all of which are actually useful he also tests over the material in a clear and straightforward manner his review sessions are not a waste of timehe actually cares that you learn the material
13021,Joan  McAfee,she was an absolutely amazing professor i really loved her she just had so much positive energy and such a great attitude she made me appreciate theatre if you have any chance to have her do it you regret it very easy and fun too i miss her as a professor
13022,Joan  McAfee,everyone has to fulfill their fine arts requirement so take this class for an easy a once a week class really boring but halrious because the teacher is a joke you ca hand every assignment except for one a week late without points off
13023,Joan  McAfee,no need to buy the book tests and quizzes are mostly matching and she gives you extra credit for drawing pictures on the sides of your exams she automatically gave all of us on our first essay assignment as long as we handed it ineven the people who handed it in after the one week grace period which applies to all of her assignments
13024,Joan  McAfee,very easy take this class allows one week grace period for all assignments except the play review lets you out a few minutes early for every class take this class to fill your fine arts requirement this class is a joke
13025,Joan  McAfee,very easy teacher gives you a one week grace period for all assignments except this one play review quizzes are matching take this class to fill your fine arts requirement rarely use the book
13026,Joan  McAfee,professor mcafee was a very kind woman who reminded me of my kindergarten teacher she made the assignments easy and clear recommend her again for sure
13027,Joan  McAfee,it was an absolute joy which is certainly helpful when the class is on saturday morning at we used the book a few times but we mostly watched videos and made fun of theater midterm prod project was fun you will have to see plays school prods and a prof production lots of fun though
13028,Joan  McAfee,it was an absolute joy which is certainly helpful when the class is on saturday morning at we used the book a few times but we mostly watched videos and talked about lovemaking and lust midterm prod project was fun you will have to see plays school prods and a prof production lots of fun though
13029,Joan  McAfee,best teacher at southern hands down prof mcafee is very excited to teach other students what she knows about theater you do not need the book listen to other reviews i open it once study hours for each test and the tests will be absolute cake the terms on the test are extremely easy to memorize g.p.a boostt
13030,Joan  McAfee,what a great professor joan is vibrant personality humorous and makes you feel very comfortable relaxing class and all material is split up perfectly for lecture mcafee is not a pushover you need the book the grade you get in this class is exactly what you put into it i am going to miss this class it was my favorite one this semester
13031,Joan  McAfee,such a kind hearted woman cares about students very easy
13032,Joan  McAfee,if you dont take this class with her you are missing out on so much class participation is a must so be prepared to do whatever wacky thing she tells you do all the assignments not a push over but not mean either tough but so sweet at the same time take this class with mcafee you will not regret it
13033,Joan  McAfee,amazingg teacher made class so much fun and it was worth going to so early in the morning
13034,Joan  McAfee,she is great she has the best personality and is always busting out into characters i learned so much more than i thought i would from this class
13035,Joan  McAfee,my favorite class last semester i even sure i was going to like theatre but she deffinately changed my mind as long as you go to class you should be golden and ofcourse watch the plays that she assigns and you should be set like she really is an amazing teacher take her
13036,Joan  McAfee,i loved this class
13037,Joan  McAfee,i adore ms mcafee i imagine anyone not loving her class pretty easy as long as you show up and pay attention
13038,Joan  McAfee,very nice and extra helpful did fun stuff like improv and lots of movies best professor ive had
13039,Joan  McAfee,theatre and joanie is amazing since it is a class where we perform a play to an audience she can get strict at times but only because a production so class is mandatory like play rehearsal she is so much fun and makes theatre fun if never acted this class is perfect for you joanie is vibrant and loving and extremely cool
13040,Joan  McAfee,awsome professor so much fun and hillarious personality
13041,Radha  Narumanchi,took this auditing class this was the only class in the entire program i c received a grade below b because he teach anything and tested you on everything i personally complained to the dean multiple times and was told he was tenured and nothing could be done to him waste of tuition seek another professor if you can
13042,Radha  Narumanchi,please do yourself a favor and do not take this class over half the class has complained to the university they do nothing because the man is on tenure by far the worst professor in ct perhaps the us i am passing along with a few others only because taken acc classes before he spends of class telling stories avoid at all costs
13043,Radha  Narumanchi,the whole semester i was struggling basically teaching myself with the book he calls the book dumb but uses it for everything if you go to every class and take good notes he will look at the end of semester and note your good note taking i was surprised to get a b thought i failed
13044,Radha  Narumanchi,please save yourself
13045,Radha  Narumanchi,he is a smart guy there is no doubt about that but sometimes you have to just call it a day and realize it is tome to move on the take home exams bad but he relies way too much on the text and explain concepts well and be ready to hear some stories
13046,Radha  Narumanchi,come on guys give him a break he is definitely hard and if you have questions about the material then you are in the wrong class go to all his classes copy his formats that he puts on the board and do all the homework be fine all his exams are take home exams take the class for his stories alone hes really not all that bad
13047,Radha  Narumanchi,wow i recomend everyone take a class with him for the experiance alone its amazing that they let this guy teach at a university scsu is a joke for keeping this guy i asked a question in class and he reponded did you read the book times
13048,Radha  Narumanchi,this class was unbarable i cannot discribe in words how horrible of a person this man is he is by far the worst teacher in the world i did not learn one thing and if you ask him questions in class he tells you that your dumb and a baby i lost my mind in this class litteraly verge of tears entering his class room please save your selve
13049,Radha  Narumanchi,extremely bad teacher know how to teach and makes fun of you in front of the whole class doesnt speak english very well either spends more than half the period talking about his life and yells at u if u waste class time on talking to a class mate for help do not take him very badd
13050,Radha  Narumanchi,congrats officially the worst prof at scsu if at all possible avoid his classes the worst class ever
13051,Radha  Narumanchi,worst prof ever talked about snow tires and his children for hours twice a week i would not recommend taking any of his classes
13052,Radha  Narumanchi,omg avoid him he is horrible you understand him everything he teaches you is pointless and help one bit for the entire course he gives these crazy long exams and their so hard because he teach anything if your an accouting major at southern you should do something else because he teaches alot of the courses its horrible
13053,Radha  Narumanchi,very hard to understand you teach yourself basically the first day of class he picks on students he rambles for hours about nothing however if you survive the semster he becomes bearable and if you ask for an extention he might allow it other wise try to avoid
13054,Radha  Narumanchi,worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life if you want to learn anything about accounting do not take this professor during class he rambles on about pointless stories and tries to cram in the material the last mins of class and expects u to stay after the class is over you basically have to teach yourself the material he is useless
13055,Radha  Narumanchi,he is extremely bad teacher i thinks that he knows everything and we the students are ignorant i would not recommend this teacher evne if he was the last one that i need for graduate with my bachelor degree
13056,Radha  Narumanchi,he is the worse professor i have ever had he does not explain the material clearly in fact he will confuse you instead of making the subject easier seriously donot take this professor he will make your life misrable
13057,Radha  Narumanchi,very difficult to understand very unhelpful
13058,Radha  Narumanchi,currently enrolled in his class which i already took at another college do not take him he is a complete waste of time assumes you already know the material and is just giving you a refresher you will have to read study and learn on your own be prepared to spend many hours rereading chapters and figuring out the material on your own
13059,Radha  Narumanchi,now hes teaching the next accounting level that i need and i dont know if i should take it because i didnt learn anything in the class
13060,Radha  Narumanchi,i hate this class im an accounting major and i havent learned anything from this class when i walk out of class i dont even remember what was talked about in class the only good thing about this professor was his stories but other than that i dont like him as a teacher
13061,Raquel  Gaytan,the class was almost entirely based on class discussion we did outside work but it was rarely discussed in class looking back my spanish conversation and listening skills improved but my writing skills stayed pretty much constant good teacher and not too demanding
13062,Raquel  Gaytan,no comments
13063,Raquel  Gaytan,no comments
13064,Raquel  Gaytan,raquel makes learning spanish very fun be warned that you will have to learn the grammar on your own as she spends each class basically talking with the class in spanish
13065,Hilary  MacKie,professor mackie is a wonderful professor and incredibly intelligent and helpful
13066,Hilary  MacKie,dr mackie is very helpful and she has a great understanding of ancient greek she also makes sure that all questions no matter how hairsplitting are resolved this can become tedious but is very necessary in a language like greek
13067,Gerald  Ludwig,if you can understand conceptual math by reading then i suggest this course otherwise you should take a lecture course as long as you read and do the assignments you can pass they provide hints and explain how to solve several of the problems however if an accounting major this probably help you memorize well
13068,Gerald  Ludwig,easy a took a week summer course about problems due every week through the learnsmart program in a system called connect plus homework questions at first i understand why everyone said this class is easy then i realized if you use all your resources find that the answers are right in front of your face
13069,Gerald  Ludwig,solid choice for accounting wonderful professor highly recommend
13070,Gerald  Ludwig,whoah i just finished a unit class in under weeks give yourself enough time to finish all the assignments score high on those as well as the tests i had some interaction with the professor but really this is a class that you can do on your own took this class with connect and had to buy an online code the only downside
13071,Gerald  Ludwig,i took the class online fall i used to study from chapter interactive mostly sometimes from the huge book or power points i took notes when watching each chapter interactive there is some extra credit learnsmart of points for each chapter also extra points for taking laccd survey weekly homework and bimonthly exams
13072,Gerald  Ludwig,loved taking this class online with this professor easy but you have to read to understand the basic concepts
13073,Gerald  Ludwig,this review is for an online summer class you have to put the time into reading and understating the content it is not a difficult class but you must put an effort into it i highly recommend his online class account is like learning a different language it takes putting into practice what you learn to ensure that you understand it
13074,Gerald  Ludwig,took him for accounting and got a b it was a breeze despite having another class during that period you just have to contain yourself and you can end up with an a or a b
13075,Gerald  Ludwig,took the week winter class and it was fairly easy very available to help with questions and concerns great class
13076,Gerald  Ludwig,i took his week accounting class and got an a homework assignments are as clear as ever he uses connect from mcgraw hill for the entire class the homework assignments have video examples that teach you how to solve the problems use all ur connect resources and you will pass make sure to do extra credit it really matters
13077,Gerald  Ludwig,professor ludwig gives extra credit so if you mess up on test the few extra points will help you and that was very much appreciated he also responds to your emails in a timely fashion i took course online and was a little confused but once i got the hang of it i was good you can repeat assignments for better grade and just fantastic
13078,Gerald  Ludwig,i took this class online and really enjoyed it assignments are laid out from the beginning so you know exactly what you are expected to do and by when you also are given the opportunity to work ahead to complete assignments before they are due if you read the material the work is easy as well as the tests i definitely recommend this course
13079,Gerald  Ludwig,i took this class online over the winter session after reading his reviews i figured the course would be a walk in the park however i was extremely misinformed the tests are extremely difficulttricky and the work load is intense do not expect this class to be a breeze passed but not sure i would take again it was pretty frustrating
13080,Gerald  Ludwig,this class was easy there really is no interaction with the professor so all up to you online resources are helpful if you need to take this class because a requirement take it because easy but if you want to learn and use it later take another teacher he is not the most friendly so expect much
13081,Gerald  Ludwig,this was a week class that i was able to complete in less than two weeks all of the homework assignments exams and extra credit problems are out of the textbook so getting an a should not be a problem since the class was online there was little interaction with the instructor aside from the occasional chat session email or announcement
13082,Gerald  Ludwig,this was a fiveweek class that i completed in three weeks with barely an effort exam questions are out of the textbook and the homework assignments give you instant feedback as to whether your answers are right or wrong the instructor responded to questions through chat and was very generous with the extra credit that was available as an option
13083,Gerald  Ludwig,time taking him easy a and if you want to learn then you will take him tons of extra credit and not a whole lot of work
13084,Gerald  Ludwig,gerald ludwig is my favorite accounting professor he is very nice and very fair with grades and he makes tests not too difficult he assigns extra credit and homework assignments that are hard not to get on i prefer his online class since a bit easier for me but he is an excellent teacher inperson as well take him for accounting
13085,Gerald  Ludwig,took accounting one class online and was very easy and learned a ton has about percent total extra credit in class and the homework has unlimited tries so impossible not to get a on that and about exams that are all multiple choice questions each on two each taking again for accounting got an a
13086,Gerald  Ludwig,if you read you will pass then tests are a piece of cake and if you need help is always open to your questions he has alot of patience great professor

13096,David  Ford,buddy likes his flow charts those working for you at the lc there dave
13097,David  Ford,no comments
13098,David  Ford,just stand up to him guys the reasons why he makes us do everything very thoroughly is because when you get into the real world how its gotta be thank him later
13099,David  Ford,he helps out when you ask for it in the first semester you just need to stand up to him when he criticizes you and respect you make sure to put units on everything
13100,David  Ford,great teacher just different teaching tactics
13101,David  Ford,he can be a bit intimidating but i find once you take the time and show him that you are actually making his time worth the effort he will treat you fine he want to waste his time with students who do anything in the class chem easy he knows it and proves it everyday
13102,David  Ford,really knows his stuff seems like just putting in time though
13103,David  Ford,its because of him i dropped out and i have become pencilphobic
13104,David  Ford,do not let this man get to you he loves taking students down i did not do well in his labs but now i am a chemistry teacher i aim to be the opposite of mr ford and have students actually like chemistry rather than run from it
13105,David  Ford,dropped chem cause of him
13106,David  Ford,just be a smartass right back to him and get along fine
13107,David  Ford,i quit school because of him
13108,David  Ford,seriously who does this guy think he is doesnt have his phd but still thinks hes god if you want to get through the class tell him off the first lab or he will lip you all year stand up to him and you will be good to go
13109,David  Ford,no comments
13110,David  Ford,sure he knows his stuff but comments need to be addressed a certain way we are adults
13111,David  Ford,very tough lab but if you check the lab answers before you hand in your lab get though it tests are brutal labs are well written make sure you listen to every little comment he makes or make you feel like an idiot

13116,Margret  Eifler,incredible woman with such a large heart and lots of stories i loved talking to her and miss presence here a lot she really helps you understand the texts with all of her background information and makes lectures interesting hopefully be back in spring
13117,Margret  Eifler,teaches german noble laureate european filmmaker and modern german literature classes she is an amazing professor who helps contextualize each work making every class period extremely engaging she give bad grades
13118,Mary  Galvin,i took the online course and it that bad i suppose if you have to see her in person better to talk to however she did freak out on us when one person posted a message in the wrong topic other than that she was chill
13119,Mary  Galvin,everyone has pretty much said it all but here it is again she is very unclear runs about four weeks behind in her grading throughout the whole semester so it is hard to tell how you are doing she gets mad very easy and does not have a sense of humor at all terrible teacher do not take her class
13120,Mary  Galvin,i was very intrested in the class but because of very poor communication became fastly frustrated online classes need to have a strong backbone for the support of the students which she doesnt have
13121,Mary  Galvin,i took this class online she never told you how you are doing or if you were doing anything correctly she is very unorganized and always has an excuse for everything take her class
13122,Mary  Galvin,do not take this teacher unclear test are awkward she puts half the class to sleep with her lectures.she makes hist even more boaring she is unorganized she will lose your work and blame you know what fun is
13123,Mary  Galvin,took online class that difficult i think a better teacher if you have to see her
13124,Mary  Galvin,this teacher is very difficult she confused me with the assignments i like history a lot and she made me dislike it a lot in her class
13125,Mary  Galvin,no comments
13126,Mary  Galvin,no comments
13127,Mary  Galvin,take from her
13128,Mary  Galvin,hmm seems nice outside of class i agree with the controlling comment and very suspicious of students
13129,Mary  Galvin,controlling woman who is in dire need of some fun
13130,James  Hannon,homework tutorial sessions are very helpful as are his office hours his voice can be kind of monotonous but he really knows what talking about
13131,James  Hannon,a pretty cool teacher sometimes the math is confusing especially if it something covered indepth before however extremely nice and helpful help sessions are a definite must for homework though
13132,James  Hannon,hannon is a nice guy hw help sessions are a must attend if u want to do decently class is just hs physics using calculus so u dont really learn much class is boring just him proving eqtns on chalkboard labs are hell wouldnt take class unless u really like physics yuck
13133,James  Hannon,i know what all these people were saying about too much math just simple calculus based physics in fact if you took ap physics in highschool and payed attention this class should be mostly review
13134,James  Hannon,no comments
13135,James  Hannon,very helpful and nice especially at hw help sessions and office hours if into physics and you have a solid background definately take it from him and not in the big lecture class it is hard material but he makes it interesting
13136,James  Hannon,the other reviewers are mistaken we only solved one kind of ode a u b basic results from odes and vector calc dotproducts and integrals are used to study physics
13137,James  Hannon,hannon is a great guy he really cares about his students the class however is a wreck i took baby physics in hs and thought i could handle it wrong this class covers all sorts of math it like vector and diffe yikes
13138,James  Hannon,this prof basically teaches a differential equations class with applications that happen to nominally relate to physics if you taken diff eqns get ready for a ride great once you get past the math barrierbut not well presented
13139,John  Reed,professor reed is a great professor but if you are a conservative he may offend you in many ways he speaks greatly about bernieites but as soon as he brings up president trump nothing but garbage besides his harsh opinion in lecture the material he gives you helps you with the exams si sessions are a must if you want a good grade
13140,John  Reed,if you enjoy history professor reed is probably the best you can get i found his lectures on point and enjoyable and he clearly has a vast knowledge of american history he provides many real world and personal examples that are useful and make the class more enjoyable he finds modern day things to compare history to to help you understand
13141,John  Reed,class was an easy a for me i went times test days and got an a tests are written essays and i always crammed days before it worked for me how you get an a go to si and ta sessions email about outline and thesis study with flashcards write pages for essay it sounds scary but easy to do would recommend
13142,John  Reed,john is an amazing lecturer his tangents are hilarious and usually relate back to the point this class was actually super interesting if you care about business in the slightest learning about its history in america is pretty tight ta was trash but the class was awesome it was graded on two essays but the prompts are given months ahead
13143,John  Reed,not going to lie how i passed this class is literally going to class a week before a midterm to get the questions and then i googled the stuff before class on my drive to the university when i did attend class the lectures were long and never on topic the tas were no help either as they were too busy with their own studies to help
13144,John  Reed,a smart and funny guy he goes off topic here and there but he covers all the information he needs you will actually learn in his class if you like history like him the class is pretty much just lecture with midterms not the easiest class that ever take but also a class made for freshmen
13145,John  Reed,professor reed is a good guy but his lectures tend to drag on and he goes off topic a lot the grading system for this course was wack your grade is made up of midterms and if you mess one up you may as well drop the course definitely go to the ta sessions before the midterms
13146,John  Reed,even understand what his lectures were about follow them it sink in
13147,John  Reed,mr reed is not very good at teaching his lectures drag on and on to the point where it made me decide to just not go to class he loves to go off topic during lectures too your grade is based on essay exams one that is points then the other two are advice go to the ta and si study sessions you learn more there and get to the point
13148,John  Reed,the only thing for your grade is in class essays and the lectures sometimes dont nessisarily relate to the midterms however you can get all of the information by either reading the book or going to the led sessions
13149,John  Reed,while he may know what he is talking about he talks for so long and brings in so many random references to the lectures such as star trek or his daughter that the important parts become unclear there are only exams for the semester and these are your only grades so be sure to attend the si and ta sessions before each exam
13150,John  Reed,take this class whatever you do professor reed is very intelligent but he rambles about the most random things he brings up glocks and tommy lee jones at least once every lecture you only have three or four grades which are all in class essays the ta si sessions are where you learn and get to the point take econ instead
13151,John  Reed,you have exams two worth points and one worth points and this is the only thing on your grade the exams are easy to pass as long as you go to the study sessions by the only been to this class on exam days most of the information you need is given to you during the study sessions just study and do fine
13152,John  Reed,professor reed and his lectures are very monotone dry and boring i only went to class twice outside of the tests which are essays and still received an a going to class and buying the book are not necessary at all but going to the ta sessions the days before the tests are crucial to passing they go over exactly what you should write
13153,John  Reed,professor reed is a really cool dude he really as intimidating as you think the class is based off of tests that are essays that may seem hard but it really that bad especially if you attend the ta sessions i was an hour and a half late to our final and reed let me take it with the full time in the testing center blessed
13154,John  Reed,he is not clear and his lectures make class go on forever he puts his lectures online so you have to go to class but class helped a lot i really learn anyhting from him it was mostly just the tas
13155,John  Reed,professor reed has clear well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams this is not a memorize and pass class you need to be able to digest the information and explain diverse factors to support a thesis statement for the exams the assigned reading is essential take notes his lectures are very helpful
13156,John  Reed,i really liked this teacher and his lectures were really interesting the tests are easy if you take notes you really need the book if you take good notes in class and if you need help the are the ones you need to talk to he gave us the question beforehand so we could write an outline for the exams
13157,John  Reed,his lectures are long the way he talks makes you want to sleep and the tests are not a good time three blue book essays it not very understanding old geezer type who care about your grades class not overly challenging but would not recommend taking it from him
13158,John  Reed,the tests on his class is in class had writing a paper about one question that he randomly choose from two questions he gave us earlier i just understand why would anybody test student like that why him just let us write the paper and turn in like a regular professor
13159,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,this was my first history class in years but professor borgwardt made it really accessible she was available readily outside of class to answer questions and her lectures were engaging and helpful she expects a lot from you in terms of readings but very clear about her expectations and helps you meet them
13160,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,professor borgwardt is a very good professor who gives engaged meaningful and insightful lectures personally i can find her to be a bit verbose and can spend too much time explaining the philosophical concept behind an assignment however the quality of her lectures and openness during office hours more than makes up for this
13161,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,professor borgwardt is one of those professors that gives hope to the world of academia by ensuring future academics are mentored well her lectures and discussions are fascinating and she is attentive to and their interests outside of class her office hours are frequent her insight is incredibly valuable and she is genuinely kind
13162,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,excellent professor
13163,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,best professor had at washu great teacher engaging and incredibly fair
13164,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,the best professor i have ever had recommend that anybody take a class with her if possible
13165,Elizabeth  Borgwardt,best professor i have ever had

13168,Robert  Vandergrift,as an a student this class ranks as the most difficult class i have ever taken due to this professor.he wants to fail you.tests are multiple choice but very tricky.students were lucky because he injured his foot so dr sanchez took over sanchez was the exact opposite of vandergrift.class is still hard but sanchez wants you to pass.take sanchez
13169,Robert  Vandergrift,he has a terrible attitude to students especially to those who come late to class his tests are very tricky but he appears to be knowledgeable he requires a lot and those who are willing to learn will be thankful they took his class
13170,Robert  Vandergrift,i would highly advise not taking this professor he is rude to students he will go out of his way and disrupt class to call a student out on being late he thinks students should know most material already the way he pronounces words such as tissue are ridiculous he is not there for the student students are afraid to ask a question
13171,Robert  Vandergrift,are you joking never ever have i had a professor who i hated going to class with the way he explains things are ridicules you dont even want to ask a question because he will make you look bad dont take him
13172,Robert  Vandergrift,very knowlegeable professor you can tell he loves teaching anatomy be late to class or he will make fun of you his tests are straight forward make sure to study the study guides he gives for each exam you will get an idea of how he words his tests
13173,Robert  Vandergrift,vandergrift what an interesting fellow he is hard but lets face it a complicated subject often difficult to tell the difference between him being serious and joking dont be late unless you want the entire class to know your business if he tells you things be on the exam dont believe him cramming is not an option
13174,Robert  Vandergrift,great professor some students say everywhere in his lecture but the truth is he is very precise and he tells you exactly what he wants you to know the class is difficult but he makes it light by injecting jokes here and there if ur serious about learning anatomy take him coz he knows what talking about
13175,Robert  Vandergrift,i think bob vandergrift is good guy his lectures went off track quite a bit he is unclear at times and is extremely mean if you are late to class even on minute you might as well not even come if your min late he enjoys what he teaches but i recommend going to another instructor
13176,Robert  Vandergrift,you have no choice coz he teaches all sections and its a basic requirement to enter the nursing program pay attention to his lectures coz what he says will be on the test it is a little difficult though to filter the important information from the lousy jokes he injects in his lectures he has a tendency to embarass you infront of the class
13177,Robert  Vandergrift,took him for only lecture he is intimidating but that is just how he is he is a smart ass too seems like he is not approachable but he is if youre willing to learn hes willing to teach when he says certain things are not going to be on the test study them believe found out the hard way but got a b
13178,Robert  Vandergrift,greatt teacher very hard but great and very nice if your serious about your class then you will pass if your not serious he will fail you hes a great bio teacher
13179,Robert  Vandergrift,i think mr vandergrift is a great teacher you absolutely must be on time and pay attention and that is really all he is picky about it is a hard subject but he tries to make it fun the tests are hard but fair and i would take him again if given the chance if you really care to learn he is the man to take he knows his subject well
13180,Robert  Vandergrift,he is intimdating his whole point is to get people who are not serious about the class out of it he will have pop quizzes when students start leaving during half time so i encourage you to stay he gives a study guide for all his test and allows notecards for test eventually which help greatly do the study giudes and you will do fine
13181,Robert  Vandergrift,he seems intimidating but throughout the sememster you will learn a lot of things this man knows what doing and trust me read the book before each class you will know what he is talking about in lecture and can make things fun for u for a subject like anatomy you will be fascinated because he is fascinated about anatomy study for an a
13182,Robert  Vandergrift,you will pass the class if you really want to for the ones who are not serious miss class alot you will fail trust me take sato for lab be glad you did lectures are confusing seem to not make sense just read the book study guides given be fine most of all try not to take his attidude too seriously
13183,Robert  Vandergrift,i know he uses the scare tactics to weed out the bad students but give me a break he red flags me as a trouble maker just coz i actually came to lab on time lab starts as stated on the schedule at i come in at says wait outside bull lectures are useless stay home and read the book also for your own sake take sato or gober for lab
13184,Robert  Vandergrift,prof vandergrift is an excellent professor.by that i dont mean easy its not him its the students it would always depend on you and only you its a hard class now but doing his share and its gonna be ok if you do your share too people who are saying worst are those that wants to get away with this class easily
13185,Robert  Vandergrift,i rated the easiness a for the avg person who knows nothing about anat rude and uptight just a grumpy guy who is bored quite humerous take him if you think you have what it takes not easy but the class is doable for an a very lenient on grading just show that hardworking and do reasonably well on the tests
13186,Robert  Vandergrift,he is very knowledgeable about a lot of things very good instructor be late i enjoyed having him
13187,Robert  Vandergrift,an ok teacher sometimes he scares the students he scares the students at first but as the semester goes on he becomes more lenient
13188,Matthew  Burbank,attendance is mandatory but he makes that clear on the first day seriously why is it so hard for peeps to go to class easy quizzes online discussions a final exam and a final page paper incredibly organized textbooks and lectures are dense but informative great polysci professor
13189,Matthew  Burbank,attendance is mandatory lectures are very boring spends mins talking about current events at the beginning of each class for this class almost all of your grade comes from finals week final paper pages exam are worth more than everything else done in the class combined which is unnecessarily stressful
13190,Matthew  Burbank,prof burbank definitely knows his stuff we always talked about current events for the first minutes of class before jumping into lecture his lectures are occasionally boring but that was more the subject than him if you read the text there a big need to go to class
13191,Matthew  Burbank,i will admit prof burbank is a difficult grader but i appreciate the high standard and always find myself working harder for difficult graders i have taken numerous courses from burbank and easily he is one professor i greatly admire and respect certainly learned a lot from him
13192,Matthew  Burbank,nice guy but not a good instructor he is boring and has nothing interesting to say he is also an extremely difficult grader
13193,Matthew  Burbank,no comments
13194,Matthew  Burbank,nice guy starts quotes with gee which gets irritating knows his material trys not to play favorites but the suck ups seems to get through you know who you are i would recommend him based on his warm personality and ability to convey detailed analyses with little trouble
13195,Matthew  Burbank,extremelly knowledgable
13196,Ewa  Wasilewska,about to graduate and classes remain the most memorable if you are passionate and interested in the topic she is teaching you will learn more than you intended to the one thing that helped me earn an a in every class of hers was contacting her she wants to help her students i had phone meetings with her before every paper ewa is amazing
13197,Ewa  Wasilewska,be prepared to read over pages a week along with all of your other classes also be prepared to write very detailed essays think gonna get by with anything to basic this is a class so the fact that she requires such detailed writing is kind of ridiculous the difficulty of this class rivals many of my upper division courses
13198,Ewa  Wasilewska,this class has a lot of reading so be prepared to stay up to date on the homework but everything assigned is very interesting she is good at grading and responding to messages in a reasonable time i genuinely learned a lot from this class
13199,Ewa  Wasilewska,hard class with arbitrary requirements jams tons of info into her powerpoints and tests on the most random things and is strict on papers and every mistake brings it down a letter grade hard to do well in this class without studying like crazy ewa helpful and feels that ok to expect the unreasonable of students take her
13200,Ewa  Wasilewska,i took this class anthropology of humor and laughter and many told me it would be very hard i took it anyway because it seemed interesting ewa is interesting engaging and her class is easy if you know how to pay attention write and apply topics easy class nice lady
13201,Ewa  Wasilewska,difficult grader jams lot of info into her power points give you good feed back
13202,Ewa  Wasilewska,avoid this class and professor at all costs lectures are a long convoluted mess that do little to further your knowledge ewa is one of those unapproachable apparently infallible professors whose exams will straight up fail an entire class after which she will spend a good chunk of the next class making demeaning remarks to you and your peers
13203,Ewa  Wasilewska,i took the online class the multiple choice exams were pretty straightforward the questions are taken from her powerpoints which are very detailed and helpful we had to write reflection papers and i did well on the first one however not so well on the others however she was more flexible with the final grade
13204,Ewa  Wasilewska,her class was a three hour lecture where she talked nonstop pretty impressive really she definitely knows her stuff we had three takehome tests which consisted of several questions which she expected answered like any paper lots of research needed to get a good grade most people got a c or low b very tough class
13205,Ewa  Wasilewska,clarity is not one of her attributes could be that english is not her first tongue
13206,Ewa  Wasilewska,honestly one of my favorite professors i am through with my undergrad but her lectures are the ones i remember with great fondness
13207,Ewa  Wasilewska,ewa is tough you will learn more than you ever thought you would three exams and two papers due she assigns a ton of reading i am taking five classes and half of my study time is just for her class alone make you work for the grade as all good professors should really interesting stuff just make sure you have the time
13208,Ewa  Wasilewska,this professor is confusing to say the least essays questions are very unclear and she will not budge a millimeter when grading if you want to get an a you need to write a turn paper for every assignment i took this class to fill upper level class requirements and it turned into a nightmare i am a very good student but she is so condescending
13209,Ewa  Wasilewska,tact test questions are ambiguous as are paper critiques she attacks students privately submitted work through discussion posts if you paraphrase and reword research and give credit to your sight source she will still give you an e for plagiarism cr hr class an easy hr pr week work load
13210,Ewa  Wasilewska,while the content she lectures on is very interesting and done well you will struggle to meet seemingly arbitrary expectations on the essay tests then as a added bonus your class will receive a lecture in broken english on how bad your english skills are the novelty of these occurrences fades quickly i would not recommend this course
13211,Ewa  Wasilewska,this class was awful the book was so confusing and difficult to use she wrote the book the lectures were mildly interesting but seem to have any continuity i would not recommend this class
13212,Ewa  Wasilewska,i took this class freshman year and it was super challenging but really interesting you have to work your ass off if you expect to have a good grade hard to pin down exactly how she wants you to answer questions in the essay but happy to work with you lovely woman
13213,Ewa  Wasilewska,i took class freshman year which i recommend for everyone i absolutely bombed my first that i met with her every week before an exam and ended up getting an a in the three classes of that i took.she turned out to be one of my favorite professors.stundents reviewing here must have given up without trying
13214,Ewa  Wasilewska,she is extremely interesting and has some adventurous stories a tough grader and sometimes hard to understand the point trying to make or follow what saying in class interesting but i think all the work was worth it for a gen ed she has some interesting opinions on religion and she will attack your beliefs
13215,Ewa  Wasilewska,a ruthless grader study groups are your best bet but even then expect to score a lower grade than usual she has no problem failing most of the class ewa tends to throw questions out of left field and often it seems that there is an excess of overlap between questions i do not recommend ewa wasilewska
13216,Michael  Pratt,he makes some difficult concepts accessible and you can definitely learn a lot from his lectures which are engaging however he tends to take a very particular view of a lot of contractual issues and principles and is quite hard on students if they get exactly the answer he is looking forthis makes exams more difficult to do well on
13217,Michael  Pratt,professor pratt is the best professor that i have ever had at law he cares deeply about his students and you can tell that enjoys teaching he is friendly hilarious and makes even the dull aspects of contract law interesting i wish i was able to take more classes with him as i know he has tremendously improved my legal reasoning
13218,Michael  Pratt,probably the best professor at law friendly engaging and knows the material cold his evaluations are challenging but fair plus the dude is jacked highly recommended
13219,Michael  Pratt,he challenges his students and tries to get students to go beyond what was written in the case and think about the larger concepts surrounding contract law clearly explains complicated topics not an easy marker but not impossible
13220,Michael  Pratt,pratt seems to really enjoy teaching and this is rare his classes this is the second taken with him are challenging but this is as it should be in law school if you are looking for the easy or a take a class with him
13221,Michael  Pratt,advanced contracts could have been good but pratt mishandled the class organization and it was all over the place i.e reading requriements sent at hours before class unclear expectations class was a philosophical cf was not impressed
13222,Michael  Pratt,an excellent prof always willing to go out of his way and assist students makes contract law interesting more of a philosophical approach will definitely take future classes with him
13223,Michael  Pratt,professor pratt is great one of those teachers who you can just feel enjoy teaching you never feel intimidated to ask a question and he never gives you attitude for asking questions in person as opposed to in front of the class
13224,Michael  Pratt,michael pratt is probably an ideal professor clearly intelligent and engaged and he makes a potentially boring subject contracts interesting plus warm and generous to his students one of the best professors had in my many years of being a student
13225,Michael  Pratt,one of the best professors ever had made the potentially boring subject matter interesting never had a prof who cares so much about his students taking all of his classes in the future
13226,Michael  Pratt,great professor not the easiest grader but definatley worth it really cares about his students and puts in a great effort highly recommend great man
13227,Michael  Pratt,no comments
13228,Michael  Pratt,a superior professor
13229,Michael  Pratt,pratt should never ever have become a professor
13230,Michael  Pratt,no comments
13231,Michael  Critelli,prof critelli is clearly a clever person but i do not enjoy his reasoning i believe he is an old school conservative professor and that is toi obvious in his way of thinking he is not neutral in his thoughts and would take a class with him
13232,Michael  Critelli,honestly one of the best classes i took he divides the semester into three major portions and his exams are only on what the material that was covered previously he does give a cumulative but its not a regular cumulative he lets you decide what you would like to discuss out of the topics that were covered throughout the semester best teacher
13233,Michael  Critelli,hilarious i had to go to is office hours which really helped
13234,Michael  Critelli,he is such an awesome guy and really loves phil only hw is readings from the text and tests all essay style easy grader yet hard material def challenges your mind to a whole other level lectures are interesting so make sure you attend doesnt really have lecture notes so you must do the reading
13235,Michael  Critelli,dr critelli is an amazing professor he makes you think outside of the box and challenges you to be out of your comfort zone a reason he says things so think entertaining you take good notes and read the text to do well in the class make sure to go to his office hours he will help you out i wish he taught more classes
13236,Michael  Critelli,wonderful teacher of any class in philosophy you are guaranteed to learn a lot
13237,Michael  Critelli,an outstanding veteran of college professors professor philo class was very thoughtprovoking as well as interesting even when i had little to no interest in the subject prior to signing up the reading is supplementary as noted so take thorough notes when you take his class
13238,Michael  Critelli,great teacher really challenges your mind and point of thought funny guy as well critelli made class amusing and lectured in a way that kept his students interested the material is complicated but he is always willing to re explain if you dont understand i would definitely recommend him
13239,Michael  Critelli,take him he really loves what he teaches and very very funny never boring very helpful with tests and grades easy its helpful to read the chapters to understand his notes only do about segments from the entire book but seriously take him second guess it no homework other than reading take him
13240,Michael  Critelli,fascinating thought provoking still thinking about the things i learned in his class in class essays if you take one or two you can make your final of your grade take him
13241,Michael  Critelli,dr critelli is an absolutely amazing professor he makes you critically thinking and challenge yourself beyond your expectation at every class meeting but its is very well worth it take good notes for your notes are your study guide he is extremely helpful and if completely stuck he allows you to call him.he is by far the best professor
13242,Michael  Critelli,very challenging in a good sense and very thought provoking
13243,Michael  Critelli,dr critelli is the best professor ever had should i be fortunate enough to achieve some success in life attribute some of it to dr critelli expanding my horizons if i could keep him as my professor change majors
13244,Michael  Critelli,love this man a lunatic and its awesome i stop by and sit in his class just for fun you the man critelli
13245,Michael  Critelli,critelli is out of this world make you laugh so hard you breathe critelli will go over the material over and over but in different hilarious ways i use to pretend i understand the reading so that he would explain it again and again because he made it so fun i would definitly take him again
13246,Michael  Critelli,dr critelli is the best professor ever had lectures were fun to attend and you leave class feeling that actually learned something i wish he taught more than just phil because i would take another one of his classes even though it has nothing to do with my major
13247,Michael  Critelli,i would take his class a hundred times the most hilarious man i have ever known if it came down to hanging out with friends or going to class i would not hesitate to cancel plans with friends
13248,Michael  Critelli,critelli is hilarious his lectures are confusing but because of the subject matter not him he wants everyone to get an a and does his best to clarify the material no matter how many times you need him to go over it take this class
13249,Michael  Critelli,i took his class becasue of the comments on this website i be more glad love his sense of humor very considerate of the working adults get to talk to him personally but i could tell a great person who cares class challenging but great would take him again in a heartbeat
13250,Michael  Critelli,his lectures are great he adds humor which is good because it was an evening class and he kept us awake he involved us all in his lectures his tests are difficult essay questions but if you study the notes you will do ok
13251,Mike  Splane,he is a very sweet professor and does a great job to make sure we pass while understanding all of the concepts i loved his class
13252,Mike  Splane,his class is fail proof as long as you turn in all the excel assignments before the final you will be able to get full credit for them that means you probably have to show up for the class his assignments are very detailed which are meant to help you out he tells a lot of jokes and is very sweet only a course
13253,Mike  Splane,this is an easy pass class and mike is a super nice guy he is always trying to help people and is understanding just miss class because then you have to do the class work at home
13254,Mike  Splane,nicest professor encountered pass the course if you turn in every assignment overall i would recommend him to anyone and the easiest course taken
13255,Mike  Splane,mike is the best amazing teacher great guy so funny overall the best man out there
13256,Mike  Splane,he is super caring and actually wants everyone to pass you work through the excel assignments as you need to at your own pace the class is kind of set in a way that the assignments are online and you kinda just sit in class and work on them he has like little sheets you turn in as proof of doing the work
13257,Mike  Splane,he is honestly one of the sweetest people i have encountered he is so kind and genuine and really cares about his students the class is an easy a and he is a very very good person
13258,Mike  Splane,it was a good excel class i entered without knowing how to use excel and this class helped a lot you can complete your assignment at home and print a screenshot of a part of your work to turn in the next class attendance is taken every class i learned a lot overall and i enjoyed this class
13259,Mike  Splane,he is an incredibly caring professor and genuinely wants all of his students to pass a credit class so really hard to fail unless you do any of the assignments he believes in all of his students and is probably one of the sweetest professors at sjsu
13260,Mike  Splane,easiest teacher for this course barely any effort required and easy final assignments a week group project and final take him for that easy pass on
13261,Mike  Splane,classwork and homework assignment is due each week this class only meets once a week for weeks so i think the work is fair and extremely easy he wants all his students to pass you have to sign in every class but you can leave as soon as you finish your classwork highly recommend
13262,Mike  Splane,extremely chill weekly assignments one in class one for homework he tells cheesy jokes every class and is super cool it is a credit class and he grades mostly off of participation completion of assignments very easy class with only a little bit of experience with excel
13263,Mike  Splane,go to class mike is very understanding so if you have conflicting responsibilities talk to him takes late work you can do assignments ahead of time and only show up to class for minutes to get it checked encourages talking in class assignment grades based on whether you do them or not not correctness allows internet on exam
13264,Mike  Splane,prof splane is the cutest professor ever he really cares about you learning he created all his assignments himself and really wants students to get a good understanding so they have the most potential when they get out of college loved his class
13265,Mike  Splane,great professor must take his class
13266,Mike  Splane,a great guy and a great prof just go to class and ass in class homework assignment every week time consuming but easy helps you learn a lot about excel in a way that will actually help you in the real world i stress enough to take him
13267,Mike  Splane,what can i say that already been said mike is a wonderful guy and a great professor designed the entire course and materials himself with the students in mind essentially a self paced class i actually learned a ton of great excel skills too imagine that a course that is low stress relatively easy and where you learn valuable skills
13268,Mike  Splane,really good teacher one of the best i have ever had joke of the day is awesome just put in a little work he is very very helpful and understanding never had an issue with submitting assignments a little late i actually lost data on my computer and submit my homework he genuinely felt sorry for me p very nice guy totally recommend
13269,Mike  Splane,fun class easy teacher and always smiling just show up do the assignment for the day and get an a joke of the day is the best
13270,Mike  Splane,very unique class format as we do the talking instead of him more of us selflearning with splane as the one overseeing things big perk about this course is that the textbook is online so practically clear cut mac users will have slight issues but it can be worked around if available to teach then take his class
13271,Kim  Fuji,if you miss a class make it up do not wait till the end to makeup the classes or you may run out of options or time a lot of fellow students i heard discussing how they had an f because they missed so many classes you are mostly graded in attendance and your knowledge of the terms
13272,Kim  Fuji,she is so fun just make sure to not miss class but even if you do she allows as many makeup classes as you want super cool
13273,Kim  Fuji,she is a wonderful instructor for yoga i enjoyed the class and she worked with me on doing other positions if i could not do what others could because of an she is very mindful of that
13274,Kim  Fuji,fun and interesting class great for beginners
13275,Kim  Fuji,best yoga instructor had she is very enthusiastic and inspirational
13276,Kim  Fuji,very fun class takes a while to get the hang of it
13277,Kim  Fuji,omg best teacher ever i was a complete noob before i took her yoga and zumba classes and i was hooked ever since really funny and points out the postures to everyone she make me feel bad for being a fatty and she recognizes good effort
13278,Kim  Fuji,she only likes the people who know what doing and if you do it right after two weeks she makes you feel like an idiot i liked what she was teaching but a bit arrogant about it beginners beware
13279,Kim  Fuji,kim is excellent and makes zumba lots of fun but it would be good if she would turn the volume down loud music is bad for our hearing and hers
13280,Kim  Fuji,kim fujii is by far the best yoga instructor especially if new to yoga she makes it fun peaceful and i guarentee feel the difference after her class
13281,Kim  Fuji,wonderful knowledgeable instructor
13282,Kim  Fuji,loved this class kim is great she is super friendly and really good at explaining things this was a great introduction to kinesiology which helps if taking any other anatomy classes
13283,Kim  Fuji,i took zumba with her now like times it is my favorite class ever i taken many other zumba instructors but as far as i know she is one of the best super energetic always fun puts you in a good mood and makes you sweat like crazy you get a tough but super fun workout each time take it you have to know how to
13284,Kim  Fuji,amazing instructor took her zumba course and it is the most fun i have had in an exercise class choreography is easy to pick up on that is if you do not have left feet if the class slacks off she will give the class a small lecture about how the moves should be done normally her all of her classes are super crowded register early
13285,Kim  Fuji,i thought she would be demanding because on the first day she said she was a tough teacher not flexible but as the class went on all her threats were jokes and everyone just laughs and jokes with her she turned out to be the best fitness teacher ever had she doesnt push you past your limits and she has alt poses if you cant do a pose
13286,Kim  Fuji,a scorpio and an only child a giver know that after taking her summer and fall classes without a break great teacher but very demanding recommend her personally but alot of the class drops
13287,Kim  Fuji,kim rocks the yoga world
13288,Kim  Fuji,best yoga instructor on the penninsula enough said
13289,Kim  Fuji,great workout and she makes it really fun if incredibly challenging
13290,Kim  Fuji,really fun nice person and interesting she makes the class more personal by adding stories of her own and making us feel relaxed so we will try harder funny and cute wonderful instructor
13291,Tim  Hill,worst teacher at sjsu no wonder mis sjsu grads get crappy jobs because the interim dean for mis is the worst teacher in mis
13292,Tim  Hill,lol all the bad comments came from frosh taking bus i took classes with tim not easy but i learned and survived i graduated and appreciate him very much now he cares about students and wants them to be independent by learning on their own it is his job to maintain the quality of mis grads one of the best professors at sjsu
13293,Tim  Hill,his way of teaching forces the students to become an expert in the topic yes you are the one who gives the presentations so you have to actually go and learn the stuff to be informative to others also unless you are prepared to really learn do not take his class and come back and whine about his class being hard
13294,Tim  Hill,make the students do the lectures and grade tests with a grading system of a doctor nobody in the class could understand what their test score really is tests are extremely long tedious and mindbobbling going to class will not help you and needless to say he will discourage you from going into mis i switch my major after taking his class
13295,Tim  Hill,we should all get his salary because we are the ones teaching his class hes even intermin dean good job sjsu sjsu is
13296,Tim  Hill,hill knows what talking about a real good guy however his tests are nearly impossible they are way to hard i have yet to find a class that has harder tests and i only have more classes till graduation make sure to memorize every definition there is you will really need it for the tests good luck if you take him
13297,Tim  Hill,i wouldnt call this a class because it is not really a class students basically teaching themselves weekly quizzes from questions at the end of the book exams are tough but he gives a great curve read the book or else you will struggle with the exmas
13298,Tim  Hill,i think prof tim is a great instructor if u want to specialize in network security this is the class it is true that he students to correct the pp slides teach the class that is for students own advantage finally he curvers the class on the grade just do all the work attened all classes exams are tuff and quizses every day but don
13299,Tim  Hill,a nice guy who seems to know his stuff however he doesnt teach it well at all trying to make students teach themselves by forming groups and make powerpoint presentations for the class however this format doesnt work you dont learn anything and his tests are impossibly hard take him if you can avoid it
13300,Tim  Hill,i think a great teacher not unlike other teachers he is willing to make sure you understand the material and spends the time doing so with that said his class is not easy yes you have to work hard and read but in the end it is worth it if in for an easy a get someone else if you want to learn take tim hill
13301,Tim  Hill,lazy teacher makes you teach the class when he is supposed to tests are beyond hard people getting with a curve skip him for every class hopefully he will get fired soon
13302,Tim  Hill,i took him both for and if you thought was bad you seen nothing yet it is the same exact format but more intense not recommended take another elective if you can
13303,Tim  Hill,real nice guy but teach if his life depended on it i agree with the previous post that he is a really lazy teacher he does not teach the class and makes student teach the class you would think why you pay for the class if your only teaching yourself his test are extremely hard not recommended at all
13304,Tim  Hill,i found this guy to be a very lazy teacher he is too lazy to lecture so he has you form teams to know your part of the section quizzes and test are hard the curve is not all that great because it dont boost your grade much not recommended at all take other professors if you can
13305,Tim  Hill,hill is a nice guy class is unconventional since students have to read the chapters and present to the class while hill comments as a result class moves really slow and some students do a half ass job tests are insanely hard but the curve really helps participation really counts towards your grade assigns a ton of reading and labs
13306,Tim  Hill,good professor had a lot of group work that is all the class is you need to teach yourself because he will not lecture he will emphisise main points in your powerpoint presentations crazy ass curve for no quizes at all particiation is a must uses webct for that labs were fun and easy credit
13307,Tim  Hill,best mis professor hands down cares about his students and is always approachable tests are long and comprehensive but the curve is insane so sweat it genuinely seems interested in the course material very passionate about computing and he uses a mac so i will give him points just for that fact
13308,Tim  Hill,tim hill rocks his teaching method was a bit unconventional this semester he made us the students teach ourselves his tests are pretty hard but he curves the midterm and final so sweat it the best advice i can give is attend class and make sure to participate in webct
13309,Tim  Hill,dr hill is one of the best and most passionate mis teachers all the people who like him should honestly consider changing their major he expects that you read the book which is short and good his tests are very tricky cuz u have to link concepts but he does hook it up with a nice curve he cares a lot about students and teaching
13310,Tim  Hill,one of the best instructors in the mis department.have to study a lot but if you pay attention in class you will surely get an a
13311,Jones,ok so this class was boring and too easy but the teacher complicated it she takes everything from the book even explanations which arent really worth while because they might not make sense to you so get yourself a real good tutor for this class
13312,Jones,she is the most horrible teacher ever and there is no way that everyone could either fail or have to drop that class if she was a decent teacher
13313,Jones,taking the same math i took in grade and i understand it cause new and has no idea how to teach it get a diff teacher if you can
13314,John  Greenland,not a great teacher pretty impatient if you understand
13315,John  Greenland,a great guy but he can be confusing and particular he wrote his textbook so it also help often feel like things have to be his way exactly which is frustrating knows a lot about music but not always easiest to understand felt like i have been so frustrated in an intro to music class esp with prior knowledge
13316,John  Greenland,he is crazy and does not give a lot of guidelines for your work but then when he critiques it he is very particular i never knew what he was looking for
13317,John  Greenland,wow this guy is a genious for real though check out his work or google him he really knows what he teaches but yeah a great teacher a lot of learning going on and he gives great ideas and tips take him
13318,John  Greenland,good teacher gives good advice on my work but sometimes i feel like he needs to let my art be my art but other than that a great professor
13319,John  Greenland,great guy
13320,John  Greenland,no comments
13321,John  Greenland,yeah john greenland
13322,John  Greenland,awsome guy
13323,John  Greenland,great guy
13324,Allen  Aldridge,he is a wonderful professor very helpful and easy to learn from if you have a choice take a class with allen
13325,Allen  Aldridge,ok so i am not a math person but mr aldridge does a fantastic job demystifying mathmatics and is very clear about the subject highly reccomended
13326,Allen  Aldridge,aldridge is as well my all time favorite teacher key words predictable unflaky cheerful helpful real this prof makes me fear using another teacher for my math courses he not only knows how to teach but he runs an understandable ship there are no surprises and the fact that he will go above the call of duty to help is evident da man
13327,Allen  Aldridge,one thing to remember in his class is that its an easy a all you have to do is write down whatever he writes what he writes is on the quiz if one wants to make an easy c just pay attention on the day of a quiz when he goes over the chapter make sure people ask questions b4 test more questions means more answers
13328,Allen  Aldridge,my favorite teacher ever i love him
13329,Allen  Aldridge,this guy is really helpful you do a lot of problems for homework but then the next day he asks for questions he would work the problem on the board and explain it i actually got this stuff and i at math nice guy
13330,Akif  Uzman,dr uzman is a funloving professor and i think he wants you to have fun while learning the class is not very hard maybe it is because we fall so far behind schedule that he cuts us some slack that said expect to read and digest some specifically assigned reading material on your own because dr uzman is likely to fall behind schedule
13331,Akif  Uzman,this class was extremely hard he expects a lot from students almost like grad school he really knows his stuff and if you ask a question you almost always get an answer in the form of another question his tests are really really hard be prepared to work your ass off
13332,Akif  Uzman,this class was about using the internet to learn about structures sequences etc to begin with book it made a fun subject boring sat in front of a computer and never used it he lectured all hours straight suppose to be learning how to use the internet for this stuff continued in next comment
13333,Akif  Uzman,but he is lecturing on molecular bio and biochem stuff he is asking us all mo bio and biochem questions even though the prereq for this class is only genetics the final was looking up protein info online but he never taught us that which is the main thing we had to teach it to ourselves if you ask for help he just confuses you more
13334,Akif  Uzman,taught at graduate level class is applied nice but ask a question and get an answer with a question so if you need help make sure you are really prepared before asking this makes it intimidating asking for help be ready to study a lot and find a study suckup will help you best
13335,Akif  Uzman,he is a nice character and he provides the questions before the tests and also gives oportunities for group solving of his assignments because the course itself is a very hard one one of the hardest taken
13336,Akif  Uzman,you have to be at a collegiate level you do not want to take him if you a nonbiology major he makes things harder than what they should be however if you are a studious person and are wiling to do lots of work you will learn a lot from him
13337,Akif  Uzman,very goofy very mind challenging but very interesting and fun
13338,Akif  Uzman,he seems to teach well he is somewhat prepared for class demands a lot of work gives out reviews for exams and is always available to help answer any questions knows his stuff and funny
13339,Karen  Douglas,i took her for summer online she was easy to get a hold of and has all your work put up the first day just wait till last min to do work she gave plenty of time to do final and quizzes i also had two discussion papers to write that are around paragraphs overall an easy class make sure you do work in a timely manner
13340,Karen  Douglas,i took her online social psych class and the class is just reading the book and doing homework out of it about or chapters approx assignments eahc due in a month it can be a lot but just pace yourself and do things early and you can get everything done however the stuff that you read is really interesting and eye opening
13341,Karen  Douglas,the only reason i gave this professor a was because of her lack of communication and her assignments were not clear of the time i took her online class i recommend if you want an a i passed with an a because i did all the work on time really all you have to do not hard at all can be confusing at times all
13342,Karen  Douglas,i took the online spring course and it was easy yes you will have to read the whole book but interesting information the test and quizzes were simple and easy if you read the chapters she answered all my questions in a timely manner she uses a point system instead of grades which i actually liked i would take her again
13343,Karen  Douglas,dr douglas is so helpful i had a mishap with the textbook company they put me in the wrong class for weeks was working on the wrong material annoying but she was understanding and gave me an extension for the material to be turned in paper online read and try and be fine very take her
13344,Karen  Douglas,she is a very nice teacher but you defiantly cannot slack in her class quizzes were given every week so reading was a must and so was attendance
13345,Karen  Douglas,prof was rude and condescending asked for help on multiple occasions and felt like she was annoyed that i had any questions in an online course she did not communicate effectively and gave short notice of deadline changes overall the class was neither challenging nor helpful and was generally unpleasant would not recommend
13346,Karen  Douglas,she uses a point system that confused most of the students we had quizzes everyday over the chapters tests too hard but she did provide one extra credit assignment
13347,Karen  Douglas,i just love her easy class work on your own was and is good
13348,Karen  Douglas,took this class online very straight forward at the end of each week four chapter tests were due along with four separate responses to each chapter she allowed for the test to be taken twice keeping the highest of the two grades the final exam could only be taken once commit to reading the book she has no problem answering questions
13349,Karen  Douglas,this class is pretty much self pace but if you get behind it will be hard to recover try to complete a test a week
13350,Karen  Douglas,as im sure she loves what she does her teaching method was not for me if you are a self learner then you will be bored in this class read the book and follow the online assignments and you will pass this is part of my major and i didnt learn anything from the teacher also read the syllabus explains her grading style
13351,Karen  Douglas,i did not like this professor at all rude condescending and belittling to her students she never actually gets to the point of what trying to say so understanding anything in her class is really difficult and then she makes you feel stupid for not understanding and having to ask questions i would never recommend taking her class
13352,Karen  Douglas,she doesnt really email you about anything excpet to tell the entire class if your not doing your work then to drop her way of grading is really confusing and she is kind of rude
13353,Karen  Douglas,karen douglas was a good lecturer but we have weekly chapters to read and weekly sometimes twice a week quizzes the quiz questions came from a question bank and she check the questions over before putting them on the quiz a lot of times the questions make sense but the one group presentation was easy if you got a good team
13354,Karen  Douglas,do not is unhelpful and super rude if you ask her a simple question she gives you a condescending answer and makes you feel stupid she make things clear and there are way too many quizzes the last few weeks you will have two a day i really feel like she sets people up for failure
13355,Karen  Douglas,terrible she is not helpful when a student understand she is very harsh and makes them feel very stupid maybe she is better online but i had her for in person but in my opinion she was not a very good teacher i can say i do not feel like i had a chance to connect with the material because it was not taught very well
13356,Karen  Douglas,took dr douglas developmental psychology during the summer and it was super easy only negative i can say is she grade the one and only writing assignment in a timely manner but still recommend her class
13357,Karen  Douglas,great instructor crystal clear about her expectations i had her for gen psych and lifespan would take her again in a heartbeat entirely up to you if you want an a
13358,Karen  Douglas,professor douglas grade assignments in a timely fashion so you were always left wondering and she give comments as to why she give you the full amount of points you have to read and memorize the chapters if you want to pass the quizzes and these are page chapters all in all i would not recommend taking her class
13359,Karen  Ball,easily one of the most intelligent professors you will ever meet classes are difficult but certainly not impossible dr ball is helpful and wants her students to succeed put in the effort and she will make an effort to help you if you come prepared for class and take notes dr classes should be one of your best experiences at alma
13360,Karen  Ball,ehs was a hard class but she made it easier to understand her only downfall is that her voice can get boring during lectures
13361,Karen  Ball,super smart woman a definite asset to education
13362,Karen  Ball,we love her
13363,Ron  Wernli,he was a terrible teacher he could not answer questions his quiz and test questions were unclear and there is never a word bank he counts answers wrong for spelling he took too long in the beginning of the semester and rushed through the end we even make it to the last chapters do not take him class started with and ended with
13364,Ron  Wernli,anatomy is a hard class you have to study if you want to pass quiz test and masteramp help a lot in the final grade great guy smart and funny
13365,Ron  Wernli,prof wernli is an awesome professor if you are looking for an a you find it in a fair professor but you still have to earn your grade attend class study the notes he gives read the book and have no problem earning that a plus very helpful and willing to answer your questions
13366,Ron  Wernli,he is easy prof compare to my previous one have quiz subjects on his web before quiz tests were little hard but i guess write down his lecture overall good teacher
13367,Ron  Wernli,omg this professor is amazng everyone should take him although his tests are a little hard with studying you should come out with a c or higher but dont think that you can get by without even trying a little wernli makes you laugh and loves biology a honest to good man who loves to help his students i recommend him anytime
13368,Ron  Wernli,prof wernli makes it really hard to make a bad grade in his class very clear on what will be on his exams and gives many quizzes of which he keeps only the top grades he will bend over backwards to help you if you just ask attend class and study i made an a very nice man sweet and young at heart
13369,Ron  Wernli,he is awesome strict but if you do the work you will get the grade he is very helpful pay attention to the powerpoints and notes know the material backwards and foreward for your own benefit
13370,Ron  Wernli,he is such a nice to help in anyway.makes learning fun with his jokes and also gives you tricks on how to learn most of the material.puts up power points and drops a lot of low grades keeps top quizzes totally recommend.great teacher
13371,Ron  Wernli,alls you have to do is study and go to class because if you miss it throws off the rythim you where in he is a great teacher really funny and very helpful i am so glad i signed up for his course
13372,Ron  Wernli,the best he will soon start teaching
13373,Ron  Wernli,prof.wernli is a great teacher pretty funny and very informative sometimes he gets off track but it helps if your taking him flex in a hour class weekly quizzes and extreme use of the textbook biology for science major
13374,Ron  Wernli,let me start by saying no science course is easy especially biology mr wernli gives weekly quizez and keeps only your best grades there are lecture test and lab test the lab test are easy if you study the lecture tests are hard you really have to study your notes if you are up for the challenge take him over all hes ok
13375,Ron  Wernli,professor wernli is an awesome teacher who really knows his stuff believe what others tell you he is the best nonsci biology teacher at sac no biology class is going to be easy if you blow off the class you will fail but i took hours this semester and have an a in his class
13376,Ron  Wernli,for being a nonmajor bio he give too much information im an student and im border line passing teaching for many years he assumes that the majority of students already know the info good for major in bio i do not recommend this teacher
13377,Ron  Wernli,took the online course and would recommend this class to anyone who needs it as long as you read your text you will do fine he gives weekly chapter quizzes and has four term papers to turn in all unit exams are given online so that makes it easy if you have a hard time going to campus study hard for his tests because they can be tricky
13378,Ron  Wernli,hard to understand
13379,Ron  Wernli,pretty worthless as a professor
13380,Ron  Wernli,way much work for a week summer course lecture tests were way hard the reviews for them were massive by the time u answer everything on the review you have to much time study plus your only tested on a third of the actual review tests look nothing like the review do not take unless you really have to blended course
13381,Ron  Wernli,hard class but only if you study uses powerpoints and videos explains things well tells some jokes in class likes to give quizes over material covered helpful professor in this class which is lab and lecture he gives a break about halfway thru hr class very challenging class only cuz taking other classes
13382,Ron  Wernli,this was a hard class and i had to spend a lot of time studying but it was all worth it a wonderful teacher and i would take him again if given the chance as long as you study for this class there is no way you could fail
13383,Glenn  Carter,cute teacher and passionate about what he does easy if you read over lecture notes nice guy
13384,Glenn  Carter,easy class if you review lectures for other week and tests are easy if you just practice online attendance wise you just need to have and that is tracked by iclicker participation every lecture so you can miss a few classes because the powerpoints are all posted online great teacher easy class
13385,Glenn  Carter,this class is an easy a if you do well on the lecture exams which can be sort of difficult if you dont study i showed up to lecture sat on my phone the whole time but you have to show up for iclicker points however you only need to end up with clicker to get so you can miss a good amount labs are easy and exams are easy if you study
13386,Glenn  Carter,class is easy to follow he gives info that is helpful for the future testing is practically given to you no book required programming part is step by step if you have problems with your tech he will help you with it overall great class would take again and he is funny
13387,Glenn  Carter,glenn is really into computers and tries to instill this love of computers into everyone in the class lectures can be a little bor if sometimes but there is a lot of useful information that you can use in everyday life with your computer if you show up do simnet training and go to lab and put in a little effort an easy
13388,Glenn  Carter,pretty easy and a pretty funny professor the tests are easy as long as you study make it hard on yourself the word exams are easy as well
13389,Glenn  Carter,lectures are long and boring class is easy if you are good with technology word and excel definitely makes you work for your grade
13390,Glenn  Carter,i appreciate how clear glen has made his grading criteria and class schedule i just felt as tho his lecture exams had low balled questions on tiny details mentioned in lecture word exams are easy tho enjoy this class but you might
13391,Glenn  Carter,this a hard class as long as you attend and go to labs he will never let you out early and he really loves what he teaches but is a little odd he expects everyone in the class to love the subject as much as him eye clicker is the way he tracks attendance but attendance is required he does let you make up missed labs just really boring
13392,Glenn  Carter,will never let out early loves the subject kinda nerdy lectures are dry lecture quiz during lab every other week
13393,Glenn  Carter,glenn is a helpful professor who want you to fail makeup policies are good you need the textbook but need the simnet pass which is pricey class is easy as long as you show up with the iclicker read his lectures before a test and good also do the simnet tutorials very helpful
13394,Glenn  Carter,its simple read the powerpoint lecture slides do the simnet lessons and forget your iclicker and you will get an a its simple make it hard on yourself
13395,Glenn  Carter,this class is as easy as you want to make it do the simnet trainings and you will do fine on those tests get the easy iclicker points hardest part is the lecture exams but they are fine if you show up to class moderately funny guy satisfies a major business requirement as well
13396,Glenn  Carter,do not miss lecture fail the lecture exams receive iclicker credit study for lab tests microsoft excel powerpoint through simnet if you miss class you can learn the information from the text book but not as easy to understand so i recommend it
13397,Glenn  Carter,pay attention to the lectures because you will have a lecture test every two weeks in the lab and make sure to do the trainings online or you pass if you study a little you can easily get a b in the class
13398,Glenn  Carter,glenn is the best person ever known let alone best professor he inspires me in so many ways i have lost track his choice in flowy big print shirts impeccable take this class if you want to have the time of your life while learning basic computer skills
13399,Glenn  Carter,glen is a goof ball super clear and very understanding of the students he talks a lot and often repeats things but at least you wont forget going onwhen tests are if you practice for the simnet quizzes you will pass the lecture quizzes were a little more difficult but probably cause i always pay attention during lectures
13400,Glenn  Carter,i really love this teachers enthusiasm but the subject still bores me be ready for his long useless talking about nothing but try to enjoy his sense of humor if you can study please i wish i could fix my grade
13401,Glenn  Carter,i came into this class knowing nothing and had a complete lack of interest in anything to do with computers now i am going to minor in computer science glenn was amazing and makes things understandable for those with little to no knowledge of computers lecture quizzes are tough but the labs are what really saved my grade
13402,Glenn  Carter,this class was so freaking hard sure its easy for mathsciency people but this was just really confusing to me the lecture was so freaking boring he is a nice man though
13403,Nancy  Eng,most unhelpful college instructor ever her exams are very confusing and reflect her lectures you can be a great note taker and do your best and read the text books but for the exams and papers unless you write specifically what her opnions are on the subject she will fail you many of her questions on the exam are subjective unclear
13404,Nancy  Eng,avoid her if you want to pass or get a good grade her tests are extremely hard and you have enough time to deal with them btw out there to trick you everytime on the exams and her project is impossible
13405,Nancy  Eng,tests are extremely hard she knows her stuff
13406,Nancy  Eng,she is hard but a genius
13407,Nancy  Eng,do not take her class she gives ridiculous amounts of work and is a very hard grader she believe in giving good grades watch out
13408,Nancy  Eng,horrible teacher impossible tests big project no compassion for students big attitude problem do not take her
13409,Nancy  Eng,very hard teacher she expects everyone to know everything she help at all very mean and very rude tests are hardest take her i hate this teacher she teach that much but she gives a big project that mean a lot
13410,Nancy  Eng,she is smart but i learned so much she really wants us toknow the stuff before you move up in the major exams are hard but they make you think it is not just repeating the book or her notes only teacher here that does that
13411,Nancy  Eng,she is a great teacher her tests are hard but you will remember what you learned
13412,Nancy  Eng,knows her stuff and can really make it interesting but cross her keep up with the reading she can figure out who is not reading
13413,Nancy  Eng,subject matter is tough but dr eng knows her stuff tests are hard and her project is very timeconsuming if you put a lot of effort into the class do the reading and ace the project do fine you will work for your grade in this class but you will learn a lot i would take her again
13414,Nancy  Eng,ugh shes a smart lady but arrogant she talks to you like dumb when you ask a question she contradicts the textbook on the tests cancels classes and you pretty much have to teach yourself everything but still be wrong dont take if an elective most likely be stuck with her so good luck
13415,Nancy  Eng,no comments
13416,Nancy  Eng,shes a pretty good professor she gives really good clinical examples when she lectures her tests are another story you would think its going to be easy but they are straight from the licensure exam so study hard and if you must present a project to the class make sure you know your stuff inside and out ive seen her rip students apart
13417,Nancy  Eng,she is not horrible like everyone says she is very nice very intelligent and passionate about her field her tests are harder than usual because they are like the license exam but i quickly got the hang of them and did pretty well her project is long but not that hard when you get the hang of it you learn alot
13418,Nancy  Eng,smart women but not a good teacher
13419,Nancy  Eng,no comments
13420,Nancy  Eng,no comments
13421,Nancy  Eng,she bases the grade on whether she likes u or not her tests are very tricky shes not makes students feel stupid she makes her grad students grade her tests so double check ur grade the average grade she gives is a c so dont expect and a she gives back all ur tests the end so u go an entire semester not knowing where u stand
13422,Nancy  Eng,professor eng knows the subject matter quite only complaint i have is how she arrives at the final grade it doesnt reflect what students do throughout the semester
13423,Raisul  Mahmood,great professor and always lets you out early tests were all curved up and ended up with an easy a
13424,Raisul  Mahmood,exams mid term and final take notes in class and read the text book days before exams easy a midterm was so easy that i believe he curved down i see anyone getting lower than make sure you attend the two classes before the midterm and final he will tell you what to study material he teaches is very theory
13425,Raisul  Mahmood,this professor is a total flake he barely understands economics his lectures are incomprehensible and he is just an overall joke if you go to class and then read the book you will be fine for the tests but beware if you get a between a and you will be getting a b my overall score was an and he said he had to curve down bs
13426,Raisul  Mahmood,take this professor if you want to learn more more than the basics he gets very confused when he encounters any higher level concepts thus you be learning much from him i wish i had only attended the days before the exams where he gave us all the material in a nice and concise form otherwise the semester wasa complete waste
13427,Raisul  Mahmood,very good prof and a nice guy only two tests no homework no takehome stuff nada all you have to do is go to class and get an a
13428,Raisul  Mahmood,great guy gives you an a if you study exams and gives you the answers to the test the week before take him
13429,Raisul  Mahmood,very good professor a great class good teacher grader what else a student needs
13430,Raisul  Mahmood,great guy very helpful and gives you the answers to both exams in the class prior to the exam not need to read the book i read the whole thing and it was not worth it take him
13431,Raisul  Mahmood,for those who hate economics take this guy for an easy easy a tests be sure to label your axis well draw the diagram he gives you the first day of class on the midterm he gives the answers to the tests the class before the test
13432,Raisul  Mahmood,dr mahmood is a great teacher
13433,Raisul  Mahmood,waste of time nothing new attendance and a midterm joke draw the flow chart and final straight from the book no need going to class just go to the last class prior to test both book and prof are wrong when it comes to stats like sumofsq
13434,Raisul  Mahmood,his teaching is bad he understand the basic concepts of economics you learn anything from this class because there is nothing new all the stuff you already know from high school and undergrad even that he is wrong in many basic theories
13435,Jonathan  Caspi,by far my favorite professor at msu he is absolutely brilliant and an overall genuine person he will relate the class material to every day situations which will help you understand it better if you pay attention in class the tests are simple definitely take him
13436,Jonathan  Caspi,professor caspi was super cool at first but then he did a complete a tough grader and help when is needed does give good feedback but he is no help i learned nothing from the class it was mainly theory and psychologist based which takes a lot to understand but he care if you were confused avoid him if you can
13437,Jonathan  Caspi,he is a great guy very funny and the class was not boring at all he does not teach from power points so expect to be writing down what he says in class the readings are important to do class consisted of canvas postings one quiz group presentation and a cumulative final
13438,Jonathan  Caspi,read a lot of reviews about how dr caspi is emotionless but he does try to notice and get to know your personality but you have to be open have my off days and always notice and he genuinely cared in regards to the class he likes messing with your head but its a good learning tool for this specific class i found it interesting
13439,Jonathan  Caspi,i liked dr caspi for this class his classes could sometimes be boring and drag on but at the end you do learn a lot try not to take his humor to heart he has a tendency to make jokes students but all in good fun
13440,Jonathan  Caspi,prof caspi is a great teacher kind of a smart ass sometimes but he makes class so interesting and time really flies by i would definitely take him again his workload is manageable and you actually learn something
13441,Jonathan  Caspi,excellent teacher loved his class we had a blast he taught me a lot and got me interesting in siblings and family theories
13442,Jonathan  Caspi,he is pretty much one of the most useless professors at montclair i really have anything to say about him other than the fact that he is useless and a miserable human being what a shame too because the fcst department is full of wonderful professors unfortunately for him he just cannot compare take somebody else
13443,Jonathan  Caspi,he is a good prof but big on apa format you will have journal entries but can email him to look over b4 handing in overall interesting class
13444,Jonathan  Caspi,great professor go to class participate read the material and it is an easy a
13445,Jonathan  Caspi,definitely not a creep dr caspi is a great teacher and i learned so much from him you have to go to class and the work is fair and reasonable he likes students that make an attempt to speak up in class and give their input overalla great professor
13446,Jonathan  Caspi,a creep
13447,Jonathan  Caspi,i had caspi for research and child in the community i dont know what everyone is talking about he is so good compared to the other research profs he doesnt give huge reports bc he honestly doesnt wanna have to sit and read b.s fluff which is awesome for us people say he is a hard grader people dont understand he just wants the facts ta
13448,Jonathan  Caspi,this class was challanging but it was also a level class anyone who thinks they are going to float through this class without doing work is wrong he is a tough grader but a great teacher work hard and you will do well
13449,Jonathan  Caspi,nice guy who seems akward in class if the class actively participating his group project was easy but i was put with someone who pull her weight and our group suffered he said it rarely happens but i got a instead of an a because of it he enjoys the topic but the class i had was long and boring never let us out early
13450,Jonathan  Caspi,he is a good guy i think he is just misunderstood i am unsure about the grading i am hoping not to get low balled with an a because it will kill my he takes fractions of points off of things which seems unfair it should be right or wrong there is no way to know the exact answer he is looking for biting my nails hoping for the best
13451,Jonathan  Caspi,he is completely and utterly horrible he expects so much from the class but does not help whatsoever he expects his aide to help the whole time he makes the rudest comments about people using their phones and even threatened the class about it stay far away
13452,Jonathan  Caspi,this class is going to be the death of me
13453,Jonathan  Caspi,best ever
13454,Jonathan  Caspi,class was fun many students appreciate his dry sense of humor i found him to be entertaining and a good teacher
13455,Richard  Davis,no comments
13456,Richard  Davis,richard davis is perhaps the most brilliant and challenging professor in this field ever had the honor of studying under
13457,Richard  Davis,loved his class has a great sarcastic sense of humor and tells interesting stories people are just scared to actually study in college
13458,Richard  Davis,im so glad he is leaving
13459,Richard  Davis,this professor was annoying he talks down to students and teaches with a bias i hated this class i learned nothing but his views
13460,Richard  Davis,dont believe ppl who say hes hard he care he drinks the blood of babies blah blah blah hes cool n stuff
13461,Richard  Davis,mr davis is highly recommended to those who take studying seriously and wish to excel
13462,Richard  Davis,he does all these mean things and just says thats the way the school it
13463,Richard  Davis,dr davis my hiney just a marxist raving lunatic
13464,Richard  Davis,dr davis always has interesting information to share during class
13465,Reg  Lilly,he might be an interesting guy and professor who knows a lot about the subject but definitely not the best professor for immanuel kant his class makes kant more difficult and confusing than it should be
13466,Reg  Lilly,ask for what you need and you shall receive need clarification want to know what the point is want diagrams of how all of philosophy fits together you got it yes reg is famous for his tangents but be interesting funny and thought provoking i highly recommend going to office hours even if you just need someone to talk to
13467,Reg  Lilly,a class on the body could be mind numbing or awesome the downside was that a lot of things discussed at all dance sports sex the upside was the professor who seemed excited and open about the topic and i had to think about stuff never thought about body modification gender assignment
13468,Reg  Lilly,reg is a great professor who is a master at working with students on their own terms where he lacks in organization and simplicity in his explanations he makes up for with his ability to make spontaneous connections to what you are interested in he has an incredibly rich understanding of any reading material because read much of it times
13469,Reg  Lilly,really good guy who is interested in his subject very discussionbased so you need to read the book
13470,Reg  Lilly,the good funny guy knows his stuff fair grader says at least one ridiculously hilarious thing per class bad can make the simplest idea incomprehensible rambles on for hours someone else said it i have no doubt he knows what talking about he just have a knack for explaining things and he goes off on confusing tangents
13471,Reg  Lilly,reg was an awesome teacher so fun and funny and he really brought the material to life he teaches in a way that you feel like making the connections and really learning his class was rich and seminar orientated so students could speak plenty and ask questions not just lecture great course fun and i learned a lot
13472,Reg  Lilly,pretty bad in a seminar class of he lecture for two hours with no break he literally doesnt stop speaking and its supposed to be a seminar there is no exageration here he seems to smart to beable to convey his ideas to undergrads he is not very articulate and makes simple ideas unmanageable
13473,Reg  Lilly,great teacher and an even better guy anyone who likes philosophy needs to take at least one of his classes
13474,Reg  Lilly,sure he knows what talking about but no one else does and if you write papers you want to basically say what he said because no one view is correct to him the expert can you tell i really like the class
13475,Reg  Lilly,what in the name of god was he talking about i sat in his class for an entire semester and had no idea what he was talking about each and every day
13476,Reg  Lilly,smart man could be clearer but what do you expect when attempting to explain the greater mysteries of the universe great teacher overall
13477,Reg  Lilly,funny and laid back his upper level classes are great really knows his stuff very confusing class but i think that was more due to the subject matter
13478,Reg  Lilly,not good
13479,Reg  Lilly,really good teacher loves philo dark humor
13480,Reg  Lilly,no comments
13481,Reg  Lilly,prob wrote it himself
13482,Reg  Lilly,i disagree wth the previous posting anybody that has ever attended this class knows that its amoung the more difficult courses i know that all the students in he class are majors in philo mr lilly is a very interesting colorful person definetly hot
13483,Reg  Lilly,simply horrible pedantic and narrowminded dull dull dull love phil and majored but for this ludicrous clown and definitely not hot
13484,Michael  Kumpf,great professor study abroad in greece he turned a class into a vacation has a passion for the classics and he displays that in lecture also a really down to earth man glad i took his class
13485,Michael  Kumpf,he is a nice enough man he knows his stuff well he very interesting or very structured but he does teach the class as a college course should be taught no points given except for tests and quizzes but he does curve quite a bit i might say i liked him as a person but never again as a prof
13486,Michael  Kumpf,i had kumpf for both latin and greek super nice and a fair grader he gets off topic a lot which sometimes makes things confusing but always willing to work with you until you understand the material s
13487,Michael  Kumpf,attending this class was akin to chinese water torture day after day of hearing his voice meander through the material just wore me down several things really got to me such as his method of writing a down then standing in front of it and the lack of any real structure to the class
13488,Michael  Kumpf,very knowledgable in class but his exams are killer only gives a study guide for midterm or final not both keep good notes but also do the reading on time be warned he does not do extra credit if your grade goes down after an exam also he has very little actual graded material so do good on all of them or else
13489,Michael  Kumpf,there is something kind of tough about his physical appearance my friend once said that guy eats glass for breakfast i think true but at least funny i liked his intro to greek class unbelievably patient with beginners
13490,Michael  Kumpf,great prof can get a little dry in lecture sometimes but it makes his random unexpected humor all the funnier when it comes
13491,Michael  Kumpf,pretty sure i took every class this man taught a great professor and a very nice man he will answer any question you think to ask and definitely go to greece with him it was one of the best experiences of my life love from a member of the animal group
13492,Michael  Kumpf,great professor take you a couple weeks before you stop finding his voice funny
13493,Michael  Kumpf,he tells great stories and his classes are easy just takes detailed notes and ace the tests
13494,Michael  Kumpf,there was only one day the whole semester where i stayed awake the entire class time my god boring everything is based on the exams no quizzes just a bunch of boring lectures and two exams go ahead and take the class if you like to be bored and actually plan on reading the text books
13495,Michael  Kumpf,on the one hand men greek grammer is extrememly boring especially the machen text on the other hand he is a super cool guy mmelghh uhh okay
13496,Michael  Kumpf,good teacher seems that we learn too much out of the book and not enough out of the class but hey its just grammer very helpful prof if you ask him questions
13497,Michael  Kumpf,takes time to answer questions eight am is too early though for any class otherwise a great teacher
13498,Michael  Kumpf,a very nice guy but this is the most boring class ever taken had a lot of trouble staying awake
13499,Michael  Kumpf,unbelievably knowledgable easy to talk to i had a wonderful experience in his class voice is funny but great to talk to i also took his trip to greece and he was a fabulous leader for students in a foreign country
13500,David  Bowman,nice man and really knows his stuff but if looking to take an easy class that sounds interesting find a different one too smart to teach this gened class
13501,David  Bowman,never seen a teacher this smart his teaching style may be boring and his personality weird but if you are really into physics the one you can always count on
13502,David  Bowman,sometime difficult to follow but is glad to help you outside of class provides copies of his notes all homework is due at the end of the semester and exams are takehome overall dr bowman is a really great guy and wants to see you learn the material
13503,David  Bowman,extremely difficult gen ed for a non scienceminded person he is very knowledgable but gets off track easily and his teaching style is not appropriate for a gen ed tests are very difficult with multiple choice options for each question he is a nice man understanding and willing to help outside of class but i would avoid this class
13504,David  Bowman,he knows pretty much everthing about the topic but most of the time you are just lost he gets of topic really easy if you like to study for hours before every test be fine if not this is not a class for you has about multiple choice possibilities for each question
13505,David  Bowman,assigns homework questions for each chapter offers extra credit on exams gives study guides trips to the planetarium a good professor very smart sticks relatively close to the book but he may expound be lazy in the class and do fine grading scale is averaged based on past class performances
13506,David  Bowman,a hard class but a fair guy read your notes better yet take notes instead of talking laziest class ever been in and a comm arts major
13507,David  Bowman,too much busy work plus a nonfun page paper glad to be done
13508,David  Bowman,use the workbook to get help on the exercises write down anything that he puts on the screen you can get a b if you ask questions and stay awake
13509,David  Bowman,tests are hard but he helps you get prepared for them i feel like learning slowly but learning thanks prof bowman
13510,David  Bowman,the tests are very hard but i got a c on each one of them and came out with an a in the class because he grades on effort you just have to show him that you are willing to work a super genius and should not be working for this school his talent is being wasted he needs to be at nasa
13511,David  Bowman,even though i hate science of any sort i was still able to admire prof bowman for his intelligence and apparent concern for us however when i dropped his class and saw him in the hall about weeks later my friendly smile and hello was met with his rude glare and rolling of the eyes admirat
13512,David  Bowman,no comments
13513,David  Bowman,i personally think he is a great professor i am kind of crazy and love physics though i would say if you like physics go for it plus he has a very lenient grading scale for level classes anyway
13514,David  Bowman,he is very boring and he teaches way over the students heads
13515,Jim  Burns,dr burns is the best professor had at texas tech he is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world you will realize his class is of vital importance his plethora of experiences worked on saturn v professionalism and knowledge of it project management are all used in it world
13516,Jim  Burns,dr burns has been in the rawls since the building was erected his class can be dry at times but you learn what you need to for your future careers he had a ta that graded our project grammar and we got a lot of points taken off he averages the substance and grammar grades together all in all very difficult work hard and you will do fine
13517,Jim  Burns,dr burns is definitely a person you need to learn about project management from we went to visit some local it companies and met with some of dr students everyone said the same things that the materials dr burns taught in class were helpful and useful for their careers
13518,Jim  Burns,he is a terrific person and a good teacher he cares for his students and does his best to help you lots of homework but you have plenty of time tests were questions the final is questions tests are also pretty difficult with a ton of information to cover but if you study the homework you will be alright answer questions in class for ec
13519,Jim  Burns,dr burns is a nice professor i love to hear his real life stories lectures are kind of interesting some slides are wordy but you need to read them to pass the test we form one team during semester and deliver many reports so expect to write a lot there are homework sets and closed notes closed books exams overall thump up
13520,Jim  Burns,homework questions from each lecture homework questions every weeks tests are questions most of which are the exact homework questions some questions are easy some extremely specific all of this while doing a semester long group project fml class definitely has its pros and cons expect that it will take a lot of time
13521,Jim  Burns,i would avoid this professor if possible
13522,Jim  Burns,a good lecturer at no time to you look at the slides on your own and feel completely lost you have a long time to do the homework just do four or five questions a day he will get into a conservative digression every now and then but it overbearing neither is his humor great class to be given a bone scorewise while also learning
13523,Jim  Burns,all test are straight from hw but you view the results until the day before the test the last homework of every set gives you less than hours to complete basically forces allnighters find hw answers online in text book or from lecture content expects you to remember everything from stats and know excel
13524,Jim  Burns,one of the best professors i have ever had at tech i like that he always share his experiences in class i am not sure why other students said his lectures were boring i found his lectures interesting he shows that he cares for future not just for students to get this course checked but learn nothing his tests were tough though
13525,Jim  Burns,he is very kindone of the best professors i have had so far at tech
13526,Jim  Burns,boring lectures really condescending with students test cover a lot of information and is hard to find even using the you have the option take this course with another professor
13527,Jim  Burns,incredibly boring lectures homework is basically just busy work tests cover quite a bit of information given the option i would have taken this course with another teacher
13528,Jim  Burns,very kind
13529,Jim  Burns,cool guy
13530,Jim  Burns,good teach
13531,Jim  Burns,no comments
13532,Frederick  Amrine,while it was evident that professor amrine knew his subject his lectures were dry and seem to pertain to the material that was on the final the final should have been easy as it was a takehome essay it really was difficult to know what he expected
13533,Frederick  Amrine,this was a minicourse taken for hu credit but it honestly felt like hours of the amrine show we never had any discussion and he just talked for two hours straight i know why i kept going then the one paper that the grade was based on had criteria laid out no examples or anything i had no idea what i was doing and paid the price
13534,Frederick  Amrine,phenomenal lecturer lectures are two hours so it takes stamina but if you engage yourself it is completely worth it lectures blew my mind every day and although the readings could be long i usually enjoyed them it was a minicourse so you get out of it what you put in and it was worth it to put in a lot
13535,Frederick  Amrine,took the minicourse for intellectual breadth a easy credit level humanities and i am a lazy engineering student he just kinda talks for hours then asks you to write a paper at the end of the semester i passed so i complain
13536,Frederick  Amrine,professor is super caught up in his own opinions and thoughts on the material he is incredibly knowledgeable but does not present the lectures in a way that is understandable to students unfamiliar with the topics final exam was released late in the semester
13537,Frederick  Amrine,class was a lot of fun and incredibly interesting i learned about things that i did not even know were things
13538,Frederick  Amrine,do you enjoy wasting hours of your week learning about the opinions of a selfinvolved professor who is unaware of his needs then this is the class for you i have never been so bored in a class no participation he just talked for hours class more about classic authors than freud orjung could not recommend this minicourse less
13539,Frederick  Amrine,prof amrine is the best professor ever had extremely intelligent person great to talk to go to office hours take all of his classes your perspective on lifethe universeexistencephilosophywhatever it is will broaden this is what college is all about
13540,Frederick  Amrine,professor amrine is extremely intelligent and is a wealth of knowledge and teaches imagination with a brilliant structure if you go into this class with an open mind you will walk out with new perspectives to view the world from i never post on online sites but felt the need to convey how great of a lecturer professor amrine is
13541,Frederick  Amrine,take this class you will have a better understanding of humanity amrine is incredibly intelligent and really helpful his lectures are full of interesting notes on history science music art religion etc lots of reading but manageable and worth it
13542,Frederick  Amrine,great professor very good to talk to during office hours he speaks with a passion that is hard to find in a lot of professors lectures often relate to the books but still are very interesting to those concerned with german culture if you have the chance take a class with this professor it will be a good experience
13543,Frederick  Amrine,best class ever taken i loved professor amrine he was always willing to help and give insight into the texts and he was brilliant in lecture this is the kind of class that was meant to be experienced while in college he makes you actually think not just memorize information
13544,Frederick  Amrine,really smart and really passionate about the subject but he really discuss the novels we read as much as i hoped the lectures were interesting but was mildly related to the text itself the final exam was quite fair he is extremely helpful especially in office hours
13545,Frederick  Amrine,very intelligent professor with awesome things to say i wish he would have focused more on the texts which were quite difficult lectures were only somewhat related to the texts
13546,Frederick  Amrine,one of the most joyful professors i have ever had he obviously teaches because that is what he loves doing he never makes you feel pressured to learn but rather just makes all sort of information available to you and what you choose to do with it is really up to you highly highly recommended
13547,Frederick  Amrine,listening to prof amrine is so passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches take the class he lets your rewrite papers until you get an a and is reasonably openminded with what you can write about overall genius
13548,Frederick  Amrine,absolutely fantastic professor extremely knowledgeable and interesting while still remaining accessible to students class material is conceptually difficult but very rewarding if you immerse yourself in it he also grades relatively generously overall a smart and kind man who is passionate about what he does and has a real talent for teaching
13549,Frederick  Amrine,the readings were very difficult and i found it way too easy to get lost in his discussions past the point of no return however he is an extraordinarily knowledgeable charismatic and funny man who truly cares about his students
13550,Frederick  Amrine,i found the lectures rather useless while they might be interesting they are incredibly boring and dont reeally relate to the books additionally writing a page paper is hard useful knowledge but definitely more difficult than expected
13551,Frederick  Amrine,an absolute genius of a man and not an exaggeration take a class with him and see for yourself he also personally grades all of your papers even though the class is very large he will always help you out if you ask him too if at all interested in the humanities you need to take a class with frederick amrine
13552,Steve  Wilson,he is fine take this course with him if you just want to pass but not to learn to love math of sitting in class and watching him struggle with technology but he is trying to get everyone to pass all midterms are take home you will get an a if you show up and try a little
13553,Steve  Wilson,warning do not take this class dr class is too all over this place his instructions are so unclear he makes basic algebra seem like rocket science he is very rude to his students at times he care if you are on your phone if you have to take him just show up sit in the back and bring headphones
13554,Steve  Wilson,although it was a super easy class he made me hate the subject he rambles on too much and his notes are all over the place he does have a good heart and tries to get his students involved in learning but he yells a bunch attendance mandatory but there is in class quizzes almost every class
13555,Steve  Wilson,dr wilson is interesting he talks to himself a lot and his lectures are boring but if you show up its super easy you can turn in hw whenever and all tests are take home tests the final is super easy and you practically do it in groups
13556,Steve  Wilson,looking back at it i loved this class but he does get off topic and is a little confusing and eccentric all his tests are take home and you can always go to the tutoring center for them but he has links online that will help you pass easily he is an easy grader and really loves his students if you get on his good side then you will love it
13557,Steve  Wilson,confusing at times and hard to keep up it is also hat to read to the board
13558,Steve  Wilson,wilson is such an amazing teacher definitely take him horrible at math and got an a in his class easy a
13559,Steve  Wilson,dr wilson is a great teacher who really cares about his students yes he does have a very unique and unorthodox teaching style he take attendance all tests are takehome yeah takehome and you can retake tests as many times as like his tests are so confusing but go to his office hours and help you understand them
13560,Steve  Wilson,he is the worst teacher i did not learn a single thing in this class do not take him sonoma should fire him
13561,Steve  Wilson,if you care about learning but want an a take this class he is super nice you dont have to go to class you can turn in late homework and re take test as many times as you want
13562,Steve  Wilson,easy class and stuff can be made up but he has to be the hardest to understand teacher ever had in my life he never answers any questions clearly and constantly mumbles never used the book
13563,Steve  Wilson,super easy class mid terms can be made up hw can be late can earn extra credit for practice problems he is resourceful and nice he is kind of old and stutters at times he even takes naps in between breaks and can put you on the spot if you talk but not in a mean way
13564,Steve  Wilson,i p.wilson extremely passionate about math and the sweetest professor i know easy class can re take midterms turn in late hw and has tons of office hours take him awesome too many kids goof off in class as if they were in high school still please be respectful and take advantage of him
13565,Steve  Wilson,the first moment i saw him i laughed he looks somewhat homeless however he is a great teacher clear easy and the midterms and final are pretty much a breeze can turn in homework late and still get credit attendence not always necessary studders a lot and goes off on tangets but good for zone out time easy ge class i recommend him
13566,Steve  Wilson,steve is a great teacher very quirky and he makes math for those of us who love it a little more bearable i work on campus and when he sees me he still says hi and remembers my name even though been a few semesters take him if you have the chance
13567,Steve  Wilson,steve is really nice and sweet he stutters and mumbles a lot really easy class take home midterms can retake them if needed
13568,Steve  Wilson,really easy and friendly teacher students take advantage of him all the time but there is no way you will not pass the class he doesnt require you to be better but he will know who you are and your name by the second class
13569,Steve  Wilson,he mumbles over every word that comes out of his mouth teaches with his eyes closed and goes on random talks all midterms are take home and you can retake them goes over any homework question you ask him to in class can turn in late hw no one ever comes to class and there is no need to he is a guy who means well and gets to know you easy
13570,Steve  Wilson,easiest math class you could possibly take he gives you the test questions and then lets you retake the tests if you dont like your score he is really nice
13571,Steve  Wilson,a little quirky but generally a very sweet guy and great teacher not good at math but very approachable and will answer any questions you have over break or offce hours obviously very passionate about math take him if you have the chance
13572,Rosanne  Lorden,doctor lorden was one of the most caring teachers i have ever had she made you work for it but she knew how to get you to really learn the material and while it was a tough class i can actually say i walked out knowing a lot of new things she did allow test retakes i miss her and if you had the blessing of being her student you were lucky
13573,Rosanne  Lorden,dr lorden is sweet and she honestly just aims at giving you the absolute best learning experience she can with that said get ready to work because yes you learn a lot thankfully her lectures are pretty helpful and she made the math eay to get she often calls on you in class she is a good teacher tough course can be slow to reply to emails
13574,Rosanne  Lorden,very nice lady but not a good instructor she has big assignments due very close together and thinks this is the only class we are taking there is so much work to do that difficult to turn things in on time her tests are ridiculously hard but she puts the hardest questions in the back so i start with the last question and work backwards
13575,Rosanne  Lorden,awesome
13576,Rosanne  Lorden,her teaching style was consistent with my own personality i prefer to be guided to my own understanding of a subject as opposed to handheld on every concept i suggest her if you are a student with a good deal of selfdrive if not you should try to find another professor
13577,Rosanne  Lorden,she is amusing and sweet but the class was extremely hard she had such a confusing way of explaining the material i would never want to have her as my professor again
13578,Rosanne  Lorden,she is a wonderful instructor and very concerned with the education of her students if you take a special interest in learning the material she will take a special interest in helping you succeed i look forward to having her in future classes
13579,Rosanne  Lorden,very nice professor lots of papers but its a psych and lit class willing to help out with the papers and gives out practice with lecture topics
13580,Rosanne  Lorden,dr lorden is a great professor this is my time taking a class from her she assigns a great deal of sumtimes she is unclear in her explanation of material but she will do whatever it takes to help all tests have the option of being retaken tests are difficult of her wording keep the book u will need it
13581,Rosanne  Lorden,great prof and extremely helpful she is very animated when she lectures you will need the book and it is truyly a writing intensive class she uses very few power points and test material comes from many difft sources major research proposals are due that counts as of grade be familar with scientific articles research methods
13582,Rosanne  Lorden,she is wonderfully helpful the book is def needed although it isnt used all the time she incorporates many outside resources into exams she is confusing sometimes incredibly nice and helpful it is a demanding course so i would suggest to go to class be prepared to start doing real research.2 main research proposals are ready to work
13583,Rosanne  Lorden,get me wrong i love dr lorden to death and a really sweet funny lady but the amount of work she assigns is beyond ridiculous every night you have to take quizzes as well as around pages of reading in addition to that frequent busywork assigned the material was not that difficult though
13584,Rosanne  Lorden,i know how she is getting all these great ratings i got an a but she is the most obnoxious professor ever had sweet as can be as a person but all over the place she is so hyper it really gets annoying after the first few classes.psy lit review was the biggest waste of time of my life.you have to do a million study write ups
13585,Rosanne  Lorden,she gives a lot of work and made me hate writing method sections i changed my major after having her but i blame her entirely she is really sweet but she gives a whole lot more work that i expected for a level class she is kind of condescending when she says things too it gets a little annoying
13586,Rosanne  Lorden,great teacher truly willing to help really cares about students very hard class and the workload is heavy but if you have to take this class definitely take her
13587,Rosanne  Lorden,extremely hard class dr lorden is a very nice funny and hyperactive professor her attitude helps hold your attention as the material is very dry the workload is quite ridiculous though
13588,Rosanne  Lorden,for starters if you have a heavy classload do not take this class between her lab and lecture it was more than the other classes i had combined but if you care to do the work and want to learn she is a good one to teach you
13589,Rosanne  Lorden,i really like dr lorden as a person however her class was so hard i agree with the fact that she really only wanted to help the people who were doing really well there were three of us that always studied together and i would do the worst on the tests but she would help the other girls more than me go figure but she is a fun lady
13590,Rosanne  Lorden,lots of work prepares you well for but the work is overwhelming
13591,Rosanne  Lorden,good prof explains things well also does a lot of inclass work to make sure you are ready for the exams two very long papers all stats have them but she is very helpful and proof reads them do it it makes a huge difference i enjoyed the class and learned a lot lot of work make sure other classes are easier to allow time for it
13592,Eric  Ruckh,eric is one of my favorite people let alone favorite professor his class is one of the only that i participate in you have lots of reading assignments and kind of hard to understand but very interesting he gets to know his students and makes everyone feel like what they say is important i wish i could have him for every class
13593,Eric  Ruckh,dr ruckh is that one crazy college professor that everyone hears about but no one seems to find find that it be easy the assignments are very ambiguous but if you talk with him and honestly try in this class the results are extremely rewarding truly deserves to be called a teacher
13594,Eric  Ruckh,everyone has that one college professor dr ruckh is that professor he makes you think critically and while you will be over your head at times learn how to swim and it will be so rewarding you can take an easy a honors class but if you want a challenge are truly an academic deserving to be in the honors program take ruckh
13595,Eric  Ruckh,this class is so much reading and ruckh is not very clear about what he expects from you the vagueness makes it impossible to get an aunless he favors you of course
13596,Eric  Ruckh,this class can be challenging and the lectures can be kind of hard to sit through but if you do not understand something dr ruchk and his are always willing to answer questions after class and in their office hours dr ruchk wants to make you think and he teaches in a very different way with that you have to go to class to keep up
13597,Eric  Ruckh,ruckh is not easy but if you persevere and show interest and participate he will grow on you i ended up ending the class with an a a surprising a most interesting class i have ever took
13598,Eric  Ruckh,confusing this is the one word that i can use to describe this professor ruckh talks too much about things that make sense most of what he says is irrelevant and i find it hard to come to class everyday he seem to appreciate your opinions if you agree with him ruckh is smart but teaches in a confusing way
13599,Eric  Ruckh,overall he was very keen about what he was teaching he make it easy for us to feel the same way and at times he was slightly offputting in regards to subject matter there was never a clear focus and it always seemed like the weirder the better was the way to go
13600,Eric  Ruckh,dr ruckh is a great teacheer and knows what he is talking about however the way he presents history as a flow of evergy can get very confusing as long as you keep up with the readings it is an enjoyable class and you can learn some valueable stuff
13601,Eric  Ruckh,i would not recommend this professor he makes a history class turn into only thinking about energy flow he makes things so hard to understand most of the time i had no idea what he was talking about be prepared to teach yourself the material this is not a traditional history class my worst class
13602,Eric  Ruckh,charasmatic yes interesting yes most definitely in my opinion though exactly what makes this class worth taking very important to keep up with reading attending discussion sections and also asking him talking with him after class professor that truly cares
13603,Eric  Ruckh,this man is a lunatic he managed to turn a history class into a literature course i left his class with less knowledge about the world post1500s than when i went into it he does care about his students however he has one teaching style and that is it so if you are not on the same wavelength as him prepare to be left in the dark
13604,Eric  Ruckh,okay this is hard readingjungandfreudinthe firstweekhard you read a book or more a week you go into hardcore hermeneutics and philosophy you analyze stories until they are just a bone of wordframework but i got so much out of this class and now i look at every story in a different way still this class is not for the weak
13605,Eric  Ruckh,this guy is definitely worth taking.pros you gain an overall understanding of anything he covers he explores new ideas with the class most openminded person i have ever met.cons you read a lot of books that i would not consider easy reads you write a lot in the fresman participation so talk
13606,Eric  Ruckh,not the history class i was expecting but that was a good thing i love eric ruckh he is the most interesting teacher i have ever had and it was a nice change of pace compared to being in the science building all day i worked hard and got a b but it was worth it because you will never have a class like this
13607,Eric  Ruckh,he makes the class way harder than it has to be if u think u are going to learn history you are dead wrong this might as well be call philosophical history than history a lot of reading but on the plus we does clarify very well helps you out anytime and keeps you moderately interested
13608,Eric  Ruckh,i loved taking this class he takes a different approach to teaching history and further wants you to understand it instead of just reading out of a book very helpful all you have to do is ask and cares about his students love to take another class with him
13609,Eric  Ruckh,this class was history intellectual thought and philosophy there is a reason his classes never fill up and of the class drops on week two you would think your in a phd program and not hist any other teacher is an easy a with effort you will not get an a in this class
13610,Eric  Ruckh,i loved my honors seminar class with him the material we read was very interesting we had to read a lot and were writing papers every week a lot of work but the knowledge you gain is incredible really makes you think of course sometimes tell you a bit tmi but he really tries to connect with his class you read long novels
13611,Eric  Ruckh,eric is a true intellect his classes show that history contains an interpretive aspect he is unique and enjoyable do the work be prepared to engage in conversation and listen all opinions and comments drive the conversation in different directions but dr ruckh has a way making all comments relevant i recommend his courses to everyone i know
13612,Stephen  Brown,he is by far the best teacher that i have had at siue he is extremely helpful and very talented i know he was retired i guess he came back to teach my class but so glad he did if you ever have the opportunity to take his class do it
13613,Stephen  Brown,no comments
13614,Stephen  Brown,amazing teacher probably my favorite he is so good at music and philosophy and man he is hot
13615,Stephen  Brown,no comments

13621,John  Verdi,mr opening questions were always brilliant case in point his opening question for the illiad why are these men fighting along with gisela berns the best tutor in st johns my only regrets at st johns not choosing his wittgenstein preceptorial and missing the chance to enroll in his nietzsche preceptorial ah st johns
13622,John  Verdi,the dostoevsky preceptorial in the bell tower with mr verdi ranks as the best class i have taken his opening questions brilliantly demonstrated the effectiveness of the art of asking questions and how it is an indispensable preliminary for a closereading of texts especially incomparable novel the brothers karamazov
13623,John  Verdi,i think the previous rater hit it one of the few tutors who could express himself clearly and who also tried to understand students judging and putting them down
13624,John  Verdi,talented at not only explaining what he means clearly but also at understanding what student are actually saying i had him for my senior essay advisor and he was extremely helpful he focuses on getting as much as possible out of any conversation without making you feel inadequate while still encouraging you to learn and challenging you
13625,John  Verdi,no comments
13626,John  Verdi,an invigorating tutor and all the girls follow him around like he is a peice of candy
13627,John  Verdi,great tutor works well with students
13628,John  Verdi,john v is the dude brilliant and brilliant at being a st tutor i learned tons in that preceptorial
13629,John  Verdi,love the fish shirts
13630,John  Verdi,never had him for tutorial but he is one of the best guys with whom to strike up a conversation if nietzsche entices you verdi is your man
13631,John  Verdi,yeay best sarcasm ever ask him to do the face thing

13635,John  Bryden,cool guy very practical approach to the material the first test made me think this class would be really difficult but by the third exam i had gotten the hang of the testing level and grading style
13636,John  Bryden,awesome teacher definately knows what he is talking about and has some interesting stories to tell
13637,John  Bryden,very fun teacher while teaching the math he relates the stuff to interesting subjects he is very intellegent and almost seems overqualified very easy to work with
13638,John  Bryden,very nice guy and really cared about his students he has some really great stories
13639,John  Bryden,awesome teacher
13640,John  Bryden,very confusing at times i would have no idea what he was talking about he likes to jump around a lot tends to forget things a lot stuff like oh yeah you need to know this to do this problem but i forgot to teach it to you is a very interesting person though and has some funny stories
13641,John  Bryden,no comments
13642,John  Bryden,definitely insane he could work on connecting his ideas so that his lectures are more cohesive
13643,John  Bryden,very nice insane my favorite professor the bestof the calculus professors
13644,Levario,a great teacher with a dad type sense of humor even though pretty young his teaching skips around a bit during lecture but he makes it interesting enough that you can pretty much keep up if you get lost quick to guide you back on track attendance is a biggie with him and could be the difference of an b or a in his class
13645,Levario,if you pay attention in class you will do good on the tests he takes his essays from the review he gives you and choses a select number for test he teached from the book which helps with not taking as many notes be prepared to work on the review sheets though because they are the outline for the test good professor overall
13646,Levario,he is young and has a great personality the thing i like is he reads a lot of his personal notes and they skip around from years within eachother but overall he is a good teacher just a little unorganized
13647,Levario,i love him as a professor he has a great sense of humor if you can take kinda groan laughs or very popculture types of jokes he gives the lesson and go every day and do fine if you slack off and pay attention mess yourself up so just pay attention and be gold really nice guy tall though
13648,Levario,decent just reads directly out of the book and gets very mundane
13649,Levario,he is very nice and funny
13650,Levario,overall he is alright relaxed cool
13651,Stephen  Hupp,his assignments were all discussion posts which have many parameters he assigns a book that is a great read it hardly feels like work if you do the work then you will get the grade be sure to request for your article that is due at the end of the class you will know what i am talking about but be sure to request for them in advance
13652,Stephen  Hupp,take him if possible i loved his class and learned so much only grades though all exams and paper so study but material was explained throughly and in a way youll remember
13653,Stephen  Hupp,he is very smart and has a great teaching style he teaches about interesting things that you would want to learn about he is awesome
13654,Stephen  Hupp,he is amazing he knows what he is talking about and is so funny that you want to pay attention and learn
13655,Stephen  Hupp,take dr hupp one of the best teachers at siue you can tell that passionate about teaching very helpful
13656,Stephen  Hupp,dr hupp is one of my favorite professors ever his lectures are fun yet informative never be bored in class but still learn a lot the funny stories he tells about his kids really help with the material sometimes if you show up and pay attention you should do just fine in his child psych course
13657,Stephen  Hupp,i love hupp as a professor this is my second time taking him and i have zero complaints the field study was super easy only easy test and paper that is really your reference letter for him to write take him for any class he offers great professor
13658,Stephen  Hupp,dr hupp is amazing he cracks jokes in every lecture that are actually funny his grading criteria for the paper is literally stepbystep and i actually learned a lot in his class because his lectures are so engaging great choice for child psych
13659,Stephen  Hupp,funny but not realistic
13660,Stephen  Hupp,this class was one of my favorites and dr hupp has been one of my favorite professors as long as you attend class take good notes and study for the tests you will get an a should definitely take dr hupp he is a fantastic professor and is really funny
13661,Stephen  Hupp,i always looked forward to this class professor hupp is hilarious and always keeps things interesting taking organized notes and attending class will make this class a breeze recommended to anyone interested in psychology
13662,Stephen  Hupp,a good professor super easy and nice i would recommend him for child psych attendance is not mandatory but if you miss he does not put the slides on blackboard so it is recommended you go plus find yourself wanted to go to class
13663,Stephen  Hupp,by far the best professor i have ever had he made the class so much fun and interesting the tests are pretty easy all you need is to read the book and study the notes and you will do really well
13664,Stephen  Hupp,favorite professor soo funny i would never miss a day because he makes class so interesting take him
13665,Stephen  Hupp,hupp is an amazing teacher he is very interactive and loves what he does his power points are very easy to understand as long as you attend class when he goes over them test are easy and over what he has talked about attendance is not mandatory but he doesnt put the power points on blackboard
13666,Stephen  Hupp,what an awesome hupp is one of the best teachers ever had made lectures fun and interesting even with some boring materials the exams too hard either multiple choice questions and some gimmies great professor makes this a great class definately worth taking even if psyc your major the bestt
13667,Stephen  Hupp,wow was he amazing he taught a whole class blindfolded just for humor also like to marry this man so hands off
13668,Stephen  Hupp,dr hupp is amazing he made lectures actually enjoyable and people were fighting for the front row i learned alot without hearing beuller is anyone out there thanks hupp
13669,Stephen  Hupp,dr hupp was great he made the lectures fun and really interesting gives great examples in the notes if you come to class and pay attention you will do fine exams usually have a few points i would definitely recommend his class
13670,Stephen  Hupp,dr hupp is one of the funniest professors at siue he makes class fun and you learn a lot
13671,Tabitha  Sparks,changed a lot of the ways i view things i have a learning disability and still managed to be captivated by the crispness of the information cold on the outside but will engage with you with disarmingly genuine honesty when it is warranted tough but fair a force of positivity in this world
13672,Tabitha  Sparks,whipsmart and clearly an expert in her field century british lit take any bull highly respected at mcgill go to her office hours
13673,Tabitha  Sparks,professor sparks is a ball of joy she is an excellent lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable of her mainstream field of expertise victorian century novels the lectures are quite heavy yet super interesting be ready to read a lot though novels of about pages each every weeks good feedback demanding conferences
13674,Tabitha  Sparks,tabitha is stict and pretty dense on the material she obviously knows what talking about but she moves really fast though her lectures leaving the class scrambling to jot everything down her quote are obscure and difficult to succeed in without memorizing the whole text but she is a fair marker in other regards
13675,Tabitha  Sparks,her lectures are thorough but dry and copious notes are required to retain the relatively unimportant details that seem to pop up on the might be a better prof for a course that interests her more but i recommend taking departmental with her if it can be avoided
13676,Tabitha  Sparks,professor sparks is an absolute delight and her classes are highly informative intellectually stimulating and has a sophisticated veneer but is actually incredibly warm more so than most other professors when you go to see her in office hours and really validates participation in class.tough but fair marker.recommended
13677,Tabitha  Sparks,okay so this was one of the most boring classes i have ever had she has this monotonous voice that drains the life out of you she simply reads off her notes and looks up once in a while yes her exams are hard but not the problem the unstimulating lectures that kills the fun out of english class dreadful class avoid
13678,Tabitha  Sparks,last night i dreamt i went to sparkyville again i know that i could never go back but i would like to professor sparks is one of the most effective instructors in the department her lectures made me feel like oliver twist for i truly wanted more take her class learn quite a lot and you will enjoy it
13679,Tabitha  Sparks,lady sparky is a remarkable her lectures were incredibly lively and informative tabby is a brilliant academic whose body of knowledge is quite impressive be sure to participate and arrive on time this is the minium respect you can pay to a lovely lady who has the stunning beauty of lady audley and the sharp wit of sherlock holmes
13680,Tabitha  Sparks,a good lecturer and a fair marker
13681,Tabitha  Sparks,her lectures are excellent among the best ever attended as they are very clear however she is something of a brutal marker and her final exam requires coverage of large amounts of course material in a very limited space she is also rather cold in person as if she has no time for you this discourages you from asking for help
13682,Tabitha  Sparks,she thinks very highly of herself very approachable and an extremely hard marker she also very obviously picks favorites would not recommend this class unless you have a strange obsession with century lit
13683,Tabitha  Sparks,never though be interested in a victorian novel class but thanks to her interesting reading list choices and informative lectures i warmed up to the subject pretty quickly not an easy but rather a just marker do yourself a favor and come to class then you practically have to study for tests
13684,Tabitha  Sparks,this woman is not only a brilliant academic but a wonderful teacher this is all too rare in this dept and i highly recommend taking advantage of her dry wit insightful commentary and wonderful lectures all that and ridiculously sweet and helpful even with matters outside the course material
13685,Tabitha  Sparks,at first i thought she was interesting and painfully intelligent then i saw the final essay topic of dry dense theorists into one pg paper and was no longer a fan once i wrote the paper i realized the point behind the class and the exercise and loved her again not easy she makes you work and think but sparks is a great prof
13686,Tabitha  Sparks,marvellous professor drily witty extremly insightful and a stimulating lecturer i suspect that anyone who like her really cut out for literary theory anyway
13687,Tabitha  Sparks,one of the most intelligent women i have ever met however never really met she just lectures to me and i listen
13688,Tabitha  Sparks,whatevershe is totally fair i got an a in one of her classes and an a in the other one time the ta gave me a and she raised it to an before i even saw the paper she can be dry but she has a great sense of humourand face it brilliant
13689,Tabitha  Sparks,really smart but horribly dense subject matter makes classes boring and exceedingly difficult incredibly hard marker as well expect over a b
13690,Tabitha  Sparks,excellent choice of subject matter and good lectures very very nice professor some were afraid this theory course would be dry but sparks managed to make it meaty and interesting
13691,Jennifer  Shaw,i took her class for the syrce art history class her class is very easy and she makes art history kinda interesting she is very clear on what she wants from the class and is helpful with questions attendance does count for quite a bit but missing a class here and there kill you i would recommend taking this class no textbook required
13692,Jennifer  Shaw,shaw is really tough and you definitely have to study hard and do the reading however one of my favorite art history teachers because so passionate and because she cares about quality really willing to put in the time to help you succeed so long as you do the same not a lot of tests puts more emphasis on writing
13693,Jennifer  Shaw,she is very unorganized she also tends to make inappropriate comments about the art discussed she does assign weekly readings and papers
13694,Jennifer  Shaw,are you an art major if you are not i would avoid this class the professor gives a lot of reading for just a ge the texts themselves were written by artists for artists and are extremely confusing and inaccessible the quizes are very long as well this class actually has made me hate modern art and i am becoming a less wellrounded person
13695,Jennifer  Shaw,cool teacher very funny at times and i enjoyed coming to class however when it comes to grading she is a beast if you want to pass this class i have three words for you study study study
13696,Jennifer  Shaw,she was an amazing teacher really funny and nice extremely helpful fantastic class i loved it used the book for terms and just when we had to compare paintings midterm and final easy of you study for it recommend flashcards
13697,Jennifer  Shaw,best class ever tests are easy if you study your ass off but worth it be prepared to start studying a week before the midterm and final other than that shaw makes this class fun interesting and worthwhile attendance is necessary but class is so interesting that you will want to be there
13698,Jennifer  Shaw,she is a great teacher but if you know art well take the class hard but it did like it midterm papers and final or a paper you pick one
13699,Jennifer  Shaw,i was not interested in art at all coming into class but now i love it she makes everything so interesting and has a sense of humor while teaching it shes really nice but you have to come to class and participate dont buy the textbook amazing class i recommend taking it but be ready to write essays for the exams
13700,Jennifer  Shaw,prof shaw was average in most areas however she respond to my emails and she seem particularly enthused about helping a brotha out it is unlikely that she will make much of an impression on you either positive or negative
13701,Jennifer  Shaw,jennifer was a great teacher she relies a lot on her ta but none the less is very clear and interesting you need to buy the books just go to class and almost everything on exams is right out of class
13702,Jennifer  Shaw,shaw is an easy professor as long as you go to class do not buy the textbook i never opened it she tells you everything you need to know in class
13703,Jennifer  Shaw,a good teacher very good at what she does but pretty and often misses class or things come up in personal life
13704,Jennifer  Shaw,i am not an art history major but i found this class to be very interesting there is a lot of memorization required which can be time consuming i think she was that hard with grading especially if you take notes and study them before the exams since all of the questions come straight from the lecture
13705,Jennifer  Shaw,very interesting class she puts it all in an understandable historical context the art and the context takes precedence over memorizing lots of reading
13706,Jennifer  Shaw,great teacher her lectures can be long but she is very clear about the subject you dont have to buy the book she explains all the concepts that you are expected to know in class she made the class quite interesting recommended
13707,Jennifer  Shaw,she is a great teacher and you will learn a lot from her class work is very time consuming though so take an upper division class from her if you are not going to have a lot of time to put into the class make sure to do the weekly assignments because they make a difference in your final grade is always will to help you and go over things
13708,Jennifer  Shaw,shaw only receives good ratings because mostly everyone taking her are arth majors themselves with a real passion for the subject quality of professor be damned as someone who is not an arth major i can assuredly tell you that impossible an unreasonable grader with the essays and midterm i take her unless you have to
13709,Jennifer  Shaw,very fair grading you never have to read just show up to class
13710,Jennifer  Shaw,great class great professor her lectures are interesting and not too much work is required in the class just study for test
13711,Alan  Kaminsky,exams are opennotes and openinternet projects are relatively straightforward but small mistakes will lose majority credit however resubmissions are allowed if you want a chance at an a you need to go to him with well thoughout questions so you dont need to resubmit use his example code as the starting point for all projects
13712,Alan  Kaminsky,cares about his students but the projects are disgusting projects as said elsewhere or even with resubmissions the criteria for design points are subjective not written anywhere and missing any means a loss of of a project grade lectures were okay but finished early almost every day tests bad
13713,Alan  Kaminsky,definitely avoid at all costs i had heard all the terrible things about him and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but all true you pass if you give him precisely what he wants to see
13714,Alan  Kaminsky,okay so the trick with kaminsky is you go to him every chance you get to check your projects if you follow the examples given and he approves of it basically golden otherwise in trouble probably gave me the most anxeity of any professor ever had though
13715,Alan  Kaminsky,do not take this man if you have the chance avoid at all costs if you get stuck with him be prepared to lose a third of your project grades based on his opinion of your design design it exactly as he has written it or you get no credit no matter how functional says he is available outside of class however he is mostly unhelpful and curt
13716,Alan  Kaminsky,he is a terrible professor and his grading system make almost every students in his class to get f you will never get from his project he will take off of your grade by saying you do not meet design he make it on his own term crazy professor stay away
13717,Alan  Kaminsky,there are only projects which you will get either get or and tests that are almost impossible to pass horrible professor
13718,Alan  Kaminsky,projects miss a single criteria out of a list of max possible grade test cases often all fail together for reasons that are either very close to being or are entirely arbitrary showing a player piece on a board before they join projects which you will often either get or and tests are all that is
13719,Alan  Kaminsky,very melancholic points on projects is either pass or fail so either or he will never admit he is wrong i got an f on a project because he stopped testing when it failed a test case that worked i went to see him and he would not admit that he was wrong even though i showed him java documentation showing he was wrong
13720,Alan  Kaminsky,he says that available to talk about assignments and loves to see what students have come up with but every time i talked to him he just grimaced and gave oneword answers not helpful in the slightest also expect to lose credit on fully functional programs because they meet specific criteria that he share with the class
13721,Alan  Kaminsky,very tough grader your work has to be perfect in order to receive credit however the assignment very very clearly defines its requirements and you even get a chance to correct and resubmit your projects after the grades are released exams are opennotes book and internet follow his instructions exactly and do fine
13722,Alan  Kaminsky,my advice meticulously read every letter of his assignment twice to make sure you miss anything give you a zero if you do otherwise very knowledgeable and interesting has a dry humor and can be pretty stoic he scares me sometimes would still take again though
13723,Alan  Kaminsky,gives you a zero on your project if you are missing a newline or have entered an extra newline even if the project is functional is unwilling to help you even if you meet him in person i met him in person and asked what i could do differently so he asked me what i could do differently wtf
13724,Alan  Kaminsky,tests programming projects and final testsfinal are opennoteslaptop directions are clear projects are essentially passfail with some credit for code design put in the work and its an easy a dont and you wont do well awkward professor but knows cryptography very well would recommend as long as you are willing to work hard
13725,Alan  Kaminsky,projects are basically passfail you either do everything right and get an a or do one thing wrong and lose at least of the grade more if it affected your output tests are open note but again you better make sure everything is right or points are going out the window lectures are pretty basic but informative good luck
13726,Alan  Kaminsky,expect to lose points for the most trivial things extra output incorrectly formatted output lose a third of the credit on the project or more tests are open book and notes but if you have exactly the right answer going to take away points lectures are monotone and will put you to sleep avoid at all costs
13727,Alan  Kaminsky,expect to lose points for the most trivial things extra output incorrectly formatted output lose a third of the credit on the project or more tests are all open book and notes but if you have exactly the right answer going to take away points lectures are monotone and will put you to sleep avoid at all costs
13728,Alan  Kaminsky,good professor explanations are clear very methodic and strict there are a lot of programming projects and the grading is though got an f on a project because of a debug statement i left on the code tests are long hard but are basically about mentioned in class lecture notes suck so miss the lectures
13729,Alan  Kaminsky,actually really good course policies are incredibly clear strict a good thing in my opinion but fair homeworks are challenging but rewarding there is never any ambiguity here which is a good thing
13730,Alan  Kaminsky,do not expect to coast through his class do not expect him to give you answers go to him with problems and he will lead you to solutions he wont give you the solution he will lead you to it and leave you to figure out how to drink if you want to learn you will learn a lot from him
13731,Rajendra  Raj,the worst professor i have ever had i learned nothing of substance he nitpicks on quite literally every single possible thing you can nitpick on and his grading scheme is there to the detriment of students i read these reviews while picking classes last semester but think it was going to be bad
13732,Rajendra  Raj,not a great professor for so many reasons he teaches pretty clearly and seems like a nice guy until it comes to academics his grading is tough and almost no one feels prepared for his tests worst thing by far he calculates your grade different ways and takes the lowest why does he want people to fail
13733,Rajendra  Raj,professor taught us well hr was very fluent and nice
13734,Rajendra  Raj,gentle advice just take any online course under him he just uploads the slides and expect from you to learn by yourself never clear your doubts you will not learn anything from his course worst professor
13735,Rajendra  Raj,not a good professor for the course
13736,Rajendra  Raj,this guy is useless and arrogant he converted a regular class into a blended one and kept assigning research papers for students to read while he himself sits at home he is never in his office most hilarious is that if you ask him something he know he will tell you a long story about the work he did at morgan stanley yrs ago
13737,Rajendra  Raj,took for plc do not recommend lectures are meaningless tests are brutally specific projects are simple but very poorly explained both because instructions are unclear and because he teach the material required prepare to spend a lot of time in his office or exchanging emails which he can take a day to respond back to
13738,Rajendra  Raj,do not take him if you want to learn something i got nothing out of his lectures was a waste of my money and time
13739,Rajendra  Raj,goes off on long anecdotes clearly knows the material but seems to sometimes have a hard time actually explaining the concepts tests are brutal absolutely brutal are a good grade buffer though overall would recommend him if you want to learn but not if you want an a
13740,Rajendra  Raj,seriously take him if you really want to learn something in database his grading is mostly related to how many times you meet him in his office outside the class discuss any coding at all even look at your codes for the project teaches from ppt slides only learn more from books and google than anything from him
13741,Rajendra  Raj,unhelpful analogies tangents skimming over slides no coding exercises before tests or project heavy on the theory low on the syntax but tests are all algebra syntax surprise graded activities mandatory graded surveys tested on project material you are expected to write project in weeks grade is tests project
13742,Rajendra  Raj,got to learn a lot he guides you through the course and we get to do major part
13743,Rajendra  Raj,very helpful and understanding medium skill set but ready to experiment with new trends in cs
13744,Rajendra  Raj,folks if you value your money never take him i was surprised at his lack of knowledge and in defense he said this is a grad course you dont expect me to know everything duh
13745,Rajendra  Raj,professor raj is an all around good professor he is clear and you will understand the material his tests are not easy but they are not overly difficult if you pay attention i would recommend him for dbc
13746,Rajendra  Raj,pretty easy and if you already know what doing i highly recommend him got the clearest accent of any of the indian professors except maybe teredesai if shaky on material though avoid you learn enough from him
13747,Rajendra  Raj,simply horrible if you want to learn a word take him
13748,Axel-Tobias  Shreiner,he is tough but if you want to learn his the way to go he is very helpful outside of the classroom also one of two best professors had at rit
13749,Axel-Tobias  Shreiner,he really is a walking encyclopedia he knows so much about programming and design patterns and of course his compiler stuff his grading can give you a heart attack expect the worst or expect the notexpected and prepare to be surprised when you do check your grade in the end his material is hardcore be serious and do the work
13750,Axel-Tobias  Shreiner,tough professor asks a lot of you he really cares how you do in his courses willing to help out a struggling student
13751,Axel-Tobias  Shreiner,one of thee best teachers if you are a slacker ha you are you will be taking the class agian take the time to humble yourself and go to his office hours if you need to he is one smart teacher
13752,Axel-Tobias  Shreiner,the best faculty i ever came across
13753,Axel-Tobias  Shreiner,excellent professor a walking encyclopedia
13754,Karen  Stanish,karen is nice she gives a reading quiz but then goes over what you just read the next class so it can be boring do the homework memorize a bunch of stuff and be hard pressed to get less than a b
13755,Karen  Stanish,karen is nice and i liked this class subject i guess but be prepared to read out of mike book before every class each class starts with a reading quiz and each week you have a huge homework due tests are exactly like the study guides go to her office hours before exams use problems right from the exam to help teach you
13756,Karen  Stanish,great professor always has a smile and is willing to help she does a really good job at breaking up material to make it easier to understand but easy to fall behind if you miss class do the practice problems from the study sheet before the exam
13757,Karen  Stanish,best math teacher i have ever had very clear on every topic is willing to sit with you and help you out i would def take her again
13758,Karen  Stanish,she is a wonderful teacher very easy to talk to and ask for her help always smileying in class
13759,Karen  Stanish,really enthusiastic wicked friggen nice and a good teacher her tests can get pretty husky but thats to be expected in linear algebra
13760,Karen  Stanish,i despise math with a passion but this professor made it livable and really not so bad really willing to help and very good at making you understand going on if you really try then your grade be horrible if you need a gen ed take this professor
13761,Karen  Stanish,she is a very nice lady and i understood her notes her quizes were easy but her tests left many people in the class with ots of questions i felt the tests were too hard and might bring down someones grade a lot
13762,Karen  Stanish,very nice extremely helpful and thorough whether good in math or not selfpaced course with limits so you can really grasp material before moving onto next topic great course for anyone to take an extremely patient and kind prof that is willing to help at anytime
13763,Karen  Stanish,excellent teacher
13764,Karen  Stanish,probably one of the nicest teachers ever met very helpful and explains material very clearly i never did well in math but got an a in her class because she was so thorough in her explanations
13765,Karen  Stanish,karen is such a great role model for the ladies in the math department she is smart confident and so into what she teaches she is always available for help she explains topics very well and is always around to talk if you are having a bad day
13766,Karen  Stanish,no comments
13767,Karen  Stanish,karen is very generous and definitely makes learning easy she is always available for help outside of class too
13768,Karen  Stanish,karen is an awesome professor very peppy and into what she is teaching
13769,Emily  Johnson-Boyd,teacher is wonderful very enthusiastic about dance
13770,Emily  Johnson-Boyd,energetic wonderful passionate good projects straight forward on test requirements
13771,Emily  Johnson-Boyd,boyd is a very sweet lady and makes learning interesting i thought dance appreciation was going to be so boring but not with her
13772,Emily  Johnson-Boyd,emily is one of the most energetic and outgoing professors i ever had there never was a day i want to not come to class i loved every minute of it she truly is a blessing and a gifted teacher
13773,Emily  Johnson-Boyd,emily is awesome she is such a sweetie definitely an understanding teacher especially compared to the evil witches darby and tiffanee if you want to have fun then take emily
13774,Emily  Johnson-Boyd,emily is the best jazz instructor had so far she has helped me a lot while studing my leg problem by helping me do in class drills she is so sweet loving caring full of excitement u rock my world stay sweet
13775,Zeno  Swijtink,this is by far the worst teacher i have ever had in a philosophy class he discusses environmental issues it is also a howto for moodle never seen a teacher go so crazy with that website
13776,Zeno  Swijtink,terrible teacher was forced to take the class due to fig he had hundreds of hours worth of homework that had nothing to do with the class asked for help and support several times and he was helpless avoid at all costs
13777,Zeno  Swijtink,horrible teacher not helpful and completely rude but i believe he has reasons behind his methods giving loads of busy work i learned how to work diligently and get things done on time i still hate him though
13778,Zeno  Swijtink,terrible
13779,Zeno  Swijtink,the worst teacher on this campus all of his assignments are unnecessary and do not relate to anything we talk about during class he likes to hear himself talk and he loves moodle but moodle is awful he is an awful teacher avoid him at all costs you will not learn anything he speak very good english and has a thick accent hate class
13780,Zeno  Swijtink,have fun on moodle
13781,Zeno  Swijtink,he is not as bad as they make it seem he has a very thick accent and sometimes it is hard to understand he gives about ten homework assignments before class but he never gives quizzes or tests homework is easy and it all takes about an hour to do small presentations and one final big group presentation i would recommend this class
13782,Zeno  Swijtink,zeno is a very redundant teacher avoid if at all possible he gives a ton of pointless work that is hard to keep up with and really teach anything related to philosophy total waste of my time
13783,Zeno  Swijtink,horrible teacher pointless class did a page paper on my emotions literally the worst teachers i have ever had
13784,Zeno  Swijtink,had him for critical thinking and he is the least understanding individual on the planet he fails utterly at the critical thinking aspect of his course if you agreeing with him he like you also a ridiculous amount of online work stay away
13785,Zeno  Swijtink,this teacher is honestly the worst teacher i have ever had in philosophy you are allowed to have an opinion but not in his class this class is full of work that has nothing to do with philosophy it has hurt me in other classes because i spend so much time on his homework that is busy work i pretty sure i got an a in his class
13786,Zeno  Swijtink,this man is not an educator his concern with his students and work ethic reflect a close minded individual awful time and worst way to start a year at college if you take this class then you might as well drop it and try to get someone else
13787,Zeno  Swijtink,absolute worst teacher at sonoma state do not take a class with him unless you want your semester ruined
13788,Zeno  Swijtink,worst professor i could have ever imagined having do not take his class
13789,Zeno  Swijtink,very hypocritical teaches a class that should teach open mindedness but yet he is the most close minded person i have met in his class there are two types of opinions his and the wrong ones i would say the class is online yet he is incompetent at with moodle the website himself if you get him good luck
13790,Zeno  Swijtink,ridiculous amount of work assigned at the time work assigned had nothing to do with philosophy looking back i can see how he tried to connect it but failed tries to be a good teacher but he just explain things well i suggest you take this class
13791,Zeno  Swijtink,worst teacher of my life do not take him this class had nothing to do with philosophy and there is so much work it is ridiculous you will be saving yourself so much stress if you do not take him
13792,Zeno  Swijtink,class is a lot of work that really has nothing to do with philosophy work itself is pretty easy i managed to get an a you just have to do the work you will get frustrated easily though you will have to buy like books and use them all a lot and keep a journal one personal presentation and a couple of group presentations
13793,Zeno  Swijtink,the amount of work he gives is ridiculous i was doing way more homework then my other friends who had a different phil teacher however i managed to get all of my work done and ended up with an a the work difficult it is just very very time consuming.i also learned nothing about creative thinking choose a different professor
13794,Zeno  Swijtink,worst teacher i have ever taken i tell all my friends not to take him he literally has made me burst into tears because i worked my butt off and got a bad grade on a twelve page opinion paper i cannot stress how much i despise this man
13795,Phil  White,very good professor overall knows the subject well and is accessible outside class attendance recommended better start working on coursework early
13796,Phil  White,he knows the material been teaching it forever if interested in lowerlevel things and some hardware love the class otherwise still a pretty simple class start assignments early read the book before lecture try to find exams from previous years as he gives no hints about what will be on them the final was difficult
13797,Phil  White,lectures were always helpful and engaging assignments were all well designed and helped me learn the material great guy
13798,Phil  White,professor white delivers the best lectures in the computer science department at rit he makes it very clear that he will not waste his time and teaches until the figurative bell rings his lectures are always clear and follow a logical progression as the semester goes on
13799,Phil  White,phil nye the concepts guy phil phil phil phil
13800,Phil  White,he know how to teach and on midterms he asked questions that he did not awful professor
13801,Phil  White,this is my second class with professor white his tests are tough and he usually budge on partial credit the homeworks and project are totally doable just start on time overall i really enjoy phil and the way he teaches i really feel like i learned a lot regardless of grade
13802,Phil  White,phil will refer to the textbook but his syllabus outline what sections of the chapter to read so the textbook a good tool to use for the class the labs and projects are doable if you start them early his exams are tough
13803,Phil  White,phil white is honestly the best cs professor had at rit his style of teaching is excellent and really helps you get a thorough understanding of the material he is a very fair grader and is clear with his expectations he is often blatantly sarcastic and has a good sense of humor overall a fantastic professor
13804,Phil  White,best class ever failed
13805,Phil  White,he is really awful professor and he does not seem like helping student during office hours
13806,Phil  White,tests are tough but if you work on the labs and projects you can make up for less than stellar test grades a fun lecturer but does digress from the topic sometimes overall i enjoyed his class
13807,Phil  White,awful professor his tests are ridiculously difficult and he give any hints about the exams avoid him or you will get d or f
13808,Phil  White,lectures are energetic and interesting covering many topics each lecture without repeating himself a ton happy to answer questions during the class overall a great professor would take him for every class if i could
13809,Phil  White,i like him for the first few weeks then everything went downhill he likes to digress a lot he never gives hints about what are on the test and he suggested to read up carither slides even though nothing similar on his test if you want to understand and get good grade avoid him harrdd grader
13810,Phil  White,very tough class very amazing professor his exams are difficult and often contain vague information that he only mentioned briefly in class if you get any aspect of the problem wrong expect partial credit super clear in lectures but you have to work really hard for a good grade
13811,Phil  White,i had professor white for comp sci for ap students no textbook that i remember labs are weekly but not overly difficult if had coding experience before if you pay attention in class he will often describe how to do anything tricky in the lab and always willing to help if you ask
13812,Phil  White,insanely good lecturer interesting to listen to fun and extremely fair really cool guy overall talk to you about pretty much anything really looking forward to taking more of his classes
13813,Phil  White,very passionate about computer science he gets really excited when talking about certain topics he keeps the mood up with lots of geeky computer jokes labs and projects are challenging but not too difficult if you pay attention if you like computer science you will enjoy the class he require a textbook either
13814,Phil  White,if you come to class be fine spent a lot of time covering certain topics and then rushed through others very helpful if you go to his office hours but beware he may sit and talk to you for hours if nobody else is waiting knows a lot about his topic and overall is a very good professor
13815,Joy  Allameh,bad news
13816,Joy  Allameh,
13817,Joy  Allameh,she is a very kind and caring teacher who is willing to give extraa time to help her students
13818,Joy  Allameh,very good teacher if you study and do your work she will love you and you will get an a she is a very lenient grader and has no problem helping you take her
13819,Joy  Allameh,she is a good teacher who cares about all of her students
13820,Joy  Allameh,quite possibly one of the worst at eku she shows favoritism biasness and her personal opinion is easily swayed in either direction by gossip and the opinion du jour she cares little for her classes and her students worked with her esl students and watched their scores fall as a result of her program do not take any of her classes
13821,Joy  Allameh,dr allameh rambles on wild tangents if you like that kind of thing great you can earn an a if you do all the work and if she likes you take an interest in what she talks about ask her for extra resources
13822,Joy  Allameh,she was very hard on grading papers she showed favoritism and she was never any fun
13823,Joy  Allameh,she is not a good teacher at all and has a bad attitude
13824,Joy  Allameh,i have hated english all my life then my senior year i got a good teacher and liked it for a year now i have had allameh and i hate the damn class she was no help to me whatsoever i hate the class and i espically will never take a class from her again eng is crap and you have to take it fine just whatever you do take dr allameh
13825,Joy  Allameh,this class was one of the worst experiences in my life i usually enjoy english classes but this changed my whole idea of what english is supposed to be i did not like this class at all
13826,Joy  Allameh,she is a horrible teacher never take this class i done well before her and she was no help with writing papers

13835,Elinor  Brown,this has been the most disorganized course i have ever taken expectations are not clearly expressed when you ask for help or clarification you do not receive it
13836,Elinor  Brown,dr brown is by far the most incompetent teacher i have ever had in my entire higher education experience if she is what we can expect from teacher education at uk than uk does not take teacher education seriously disorganized unreasonable unclear incompetent ineffective
13837,Elinor  Brown,poor communication and organization of course materials and student expectations
13838,Elinor  Brown,great information i learned a lot in this course i would recommend this class for all preservice teachers
13839,Elinor  Brown,excellent
13840,Elinor  Brown,great experience very know knowledgeable and helpful
13841,Elinor  Brown,totally disorganized
13842,Elinor  Brown,sometimes unorganized and boring but seems to be passionate about education
13843,Elinor  Brown,no comments
13844,Jeffery  Bieber,he is very specific of what he wants but tell you anything he grades with a letter grade and decides your grade based on how he feels at the time he has no legit way of grading
13845,Jeffery  Bieber,in the main i would say dr bieber is quite demanding and depending the sensitivity of the topic can come across as a pedant infinitesimal vocabulary wealth of experience however definite declivity toward student affairs depressing this course serves as a rite of passage to the not for the faint of heart the life of the mind
13846,Jeffery  Bieber,thought the course was okay but somewhat boring we seemed to always discuss surface issues and not the real deep philosophical stuff jeff is a good scholar one of his articles was part of the syllabus and it was a great article but we really get into the theory behind it i.e cultural reproduction could have been better
13847,Jeffery  Bieber,started off not liking the class ended up loving it and dr bieber we had some real in there and dr bieber was really patient with them even though we were not dr bieber seems like a hard core republican but he really is a bleeding heart liberal which i like great class and great instructor
13848,Jeffery  Bieber,great professor
13849,Jeffery  Bieber,no comments
13850,Eckhardt,boring not inspiring and teach he just babbles all class and all the learning is you reading the textbook quizzes and tests have nothing to do with any material learned in class
13851,Eckhardt,do not take his class unless you want to rip your hair out for an hour and min he is so delirious he talks about his life stories the whole class and anything unrelated to what we are supposed to be learning which makes the tests impossible.the only thing i learned about psychology is that the more i listen to him the dumber i get
13852,Eckhardt,he is an extremely sweet and cheesy old man but unfortunately also a total snore psychology should be an interesting course and he just present information in an interesting manner almost impossible to take notes on anything he says
13853,Eckhardt,professor.however the class is a joke.he does not cover the material in the text it is almost impossible to stay awake when he is speaking.if you are a motivated student you can do well if you are not stay away from this course
13854,Eckhardt,a really nice guy the whole class sleeps and he makes really corney jokes but a easy a the test are easy and the final paper is only two pages and he is very generous with giving out i recommend this class
13855,Eckhardt,this class is so boring i have never had such a boring class he talk about anything to do with the text i did not know it was possible to talk hours about absolutly nothing easy a if you do the homework just expect any reading to be covered in class
13856,Eckhardt,old guy who reminds me of my grandfather and tells really corny jokes the whole class sleeps but a really easy class if youre into reading out of the text book quizzes on each chapter once a week t or f and he lets you make up tests if youre not there easy a
13857,Eckhardt,no comments
13858,Shel  Schwartz,he share stories alot easy and fun class to be in there weekly quizzes count of the total grade final counts the quizzes are directly from the notes and chapters just read pay attention and you should pass with flying colors.he drop lowest quizzes and his final are based on weekly quizzes if you do good weekly then it ez a
13859,Shel  Schwartz,shel is a fantastic teacher he wants everyone to understand the material and he keeps it interesting all of the tests come straight from his notes and one paper nothing to sweat just attend class take notes and study that easy got an a
13860,Shel  Schwartz,i took psych class when i was a junior in high school and he was nothing but helpful and willing to do extra for his students he is funny and keeps class interesting
13861,Shel  Schwartz,shel gives psychology the reality kick it can be hard to read his handwriting on the board he only gives a midterm and a final the final is not cumulative a paper is expected you are basically graded on attendance participation the paper and tests know your stuff a cool guy especially for the older students
13862,Shel  Schwartz,he talks a lot and will get off on a tangent often i got an a in his class but i learn much he makes you summarize journal articles which are impossible to understand and you learn anything from them he is a nice man but not a very good teacher i learn more on the days when we had a sub
13863,Shel  Schwartz,great teacher very entertaining.take notes.his exams are mostly his notes.if you pay attention you could easily get a good grade
13864,Shel  Schwartz,great teacher entertaining and nice take notes tests are a little difficult and the research paper sucks but if you do the work and get it in on time get a good grade very fair
13865,Shel  Schwartz,professor schwartz is one of the most fun teachers i have had in years and has some really funny stories
13866,Shel  Schwartz,professor schwartz is one of the most fun teachers i have had in years and has some really funny stories
13867,Shel  Schwartz,best teacher ive ever had made sitting three hours straight a pleasure and had me wanting more psych once the hours was over a great guy very very funny unbeliebably passionate pleasant and down to earth i would take every class with him if i could highly recommended
13868,Shel  Schwartz,his lectures are great book is terrible he does write alot on the board however his tests are difficult mc questions confusing at times research paper is rough however if you do it he will give you a good grade not an easy a
13869,Shel  Schwartz,fun teacher writes alot on the board take notes you will be tested on the notes research paper is killer be prepared all in all he is a cool guy looked forward to coming to class
13870,William  Farmen,an invested and intelligent professor his classroom is casual and socratic his manner is relaxed and discussive he is a little disorganized but makes up for it with his passion for seeing his students grasp the material a1
13871,William  Farmen,dr farmen quickly became one of my favorite professors he is so smart and will take time to help you his classes are not the easiest but they are challenging he is funny too one of the best
13872,William  Farmen,no comments
13873,William  Farmen,amazing really all i have to say
13874,William  Farmen,farmen is one of the best professors at this university he pushed the envelope for our class and got us to really delve deep into our thoughts and gain so very much from his class it was a great life experience and i would recommend him more than any other prof also since his class is mainly discussion little real homework either
13875,William  Farmen,i absolutly hated the class he was horrible i believe that he can teach at all
13876,William  Farmen,hes nuts and crazy but great he is so smart
13877,William  Farmen,genius he was the reason i switched my major because he said it challenging me in any way now i love what im doing thanks dr farmen
13878,William  Farmen,very good teacher hilarious the first day of class with him i was sure he was he just naturally that way he knows ridiculous amounts of psychology he also understands that taking physical notes is dumb like points right there
13879,William  Farmen,dr farmen challenges your preconceptions makes you question your opinion then helps you articulate what you really mean he is great at teaching lectures and at directing discussion courses
13880,William  Farmen,wonderful incredibly unique teaching method much more enjoyable than the standard teacherstudent style his class was the highlight of my week he is incredibly knowledgable about the human mind and emotionsquite possibly the most intelligent prof on campus i changed my major to psychology too
13881,William  Farmen,dr style is very interesting very enjoyable in class although he talks about sex way too much i said he hot cause like years old
13882,William  Farmen,he is crazy he knows so much but he s difficult to understand because he is always everywhere so so smart though
13883,William  Farmen,a little insane in a good way he is a great friend too
13884,William  Farmen,wonderful teacher you will learn so much about life and yourself in his courses
13885,William  Farmen,no comments
13886,William  Farmen,hilarious but very knowledgeable good prof
13887,William  Farmen,dr farmen is by far the most practiced and advanced prof ever studied under his understanding of human behavior motivation and innerworkings is truly a great resource when studying psychology i will use what taught me every day
13888,Mary  Anderson,mary seem to care about learning fairness or knowledge as much as she cares about preening and posing in front of a room of people not a good teacher
13889,Mary  Anderson,expects way to much without being very flexible
13890,Mary  Anderson,very intersting class though lots of reading the lectures were all discussion and we were allowed to resubmit each paper once it was important to do all the reading and attend most classes but all in all very reasonable
13891,Mary  Anderson,no comments
13892,Mary  Anderson,very interesting
13893,Mary  Anderson,this was a pointless class the assignments were pointless
13894,Mary  Anderson,no comments
13895,Mary  Anderson,no comments
13896,Mary  Anderson,unreasonable assignments annotated bibliography as long as paper
13897,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,nice guy works with you if you have a problem i dislike psychology but really enjoyed mr class
13898,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,tests very hard failed everything except made a c on final and somehow managed to make a c in class if you are having a hard time go talk to him about it act interested in his class and if you are a girl act interested in him and he will pass you dress cute and flirt but class is pretty hard
13899,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,he was a very good teacher i enjoyed his class quite a bit he has many interesting stories to tell he knows his stuff watch out for pop quizes in this class
13900,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,makes alot of jokes talks about his past work quite a bit and makes what could be a blah subject pretty fun and finds ways to get things to stick into your mind overall a pretty great teacher and you can talk to him about anything theres always someone who blurts out random things in class
13901,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,prof t is one of the best profs ever had his reviews are helpful he has a good sense of humor and he keeps the lectures interesting not to mention he majorly pads your grades i failed most pop quizzes and still made an a in the class
13902,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,mr tiefenwerth is a very good professor his reviews are extremely helpful and very accurate towards the test he is very fair and is willing to work with anyone he is understanding and empathetic with students because he is one himself
13903,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,he rambles and his reviews have little to do with his test if you keep up it is all pretty fair
13904,Thomas  Tiefenwerth,study vocabulary and read a bit of the chapter show you are trying show up and participate in class and you will do fine he is a wonderful professor
13905,Marion  Goldman,extremely harsh and arbitrary grader she does lie in this case about provides little to no help despite student requests unclear about grading and assignment requirements despite seemingly clear assignment descriptions syllabus etc
13906,Marion  Goldman,two words nut job this is one kooky chick lady you lied to us and i told you that you lied and you never bothered to correct yourself
13907,Marion  Goldman,a little confusing and a little cooky but pretty cool at the same time
13908,Marion  Goldman,no comments
13909,Marion  Goldman,no comments
13910,Mark  Unno,this is the best class i have taken at u of o so far it gives incredible insight into the dark side of self in religion just like the title suggests beyond that it really teaches you a lot about yourself i started my journey of selfdiscovery which is something i did not think i would be saying it is an amazing class i highly recommend it
13911,Mark  Unno,guys take this class i have learned more about myself through learning about the dark self than at any other point in my life not to mention mark is one of the funniest nicest and most intellectual professors i have ever had and never have i been bummed when the hour and fifty minutes is up and i have to wait to go to class again amazing
13912,Mark  Unno,professor unno is a topquality educator his passion for the subject is apparent in the way through which he presents the material incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining i do recommend that you keep up with the reading but if you get a little behind professor unno will cover the material thoroughly in class highly recommended
13913,Mark  Unno,professor unno gives amazing lectures but at times they can be confusing or he gets off track he has a clear grading criteria but is picky in how he wants things done overall he is a kind professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he is talking about he is very knowledgeable and i would recommend him
13914,Mark  Unno,mark unno is an amazing profesor hilarious and the amount of work you have to do is really reasonable short tests and a few papers the readings are pretty basic too by no means a person but this class is very doable
13915,Mark  Unno,too hard of a grader for a class ge grades but follows guidelines and a bit ridiculous no straight a student but i do well on essays and i got a grade i expecting my ge later said hard to receive an a on essays in this class essays are a good part of the class first test also included about grammar why
13916,Mark  Unno,really funny if your class is well behaved he really likes teaching not a super fun class but he makes it fun
13917,Mark  Unno,interesting engaging lectures a cool guy that always has interesting stories to help you understand a lot of papers and a couple tests and a ton of reading but the whole class is fairly laidback and interesting so it feel like a big workload
13918,Mark  Unno,great teacher with interesting experience and a delightful sense of humor learn a lot in his classes
13919,Mark  Unno,probably the greatest teacher i have ever had taking his class actually changed my outlook on religion and life you must go to class and listen he is an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgable he makes all his philosophical points easy to understand often using his cats as examples haha or ice cream highly recommended amazing prof
13920,Mark  Unno,greatest funniest more intelligent teacher ever had incredible very philosophical but used incredible analogies to help the class understand what he was talking about absolutely hilarious in lecture extremely knowledgeable about his field i have profound respect for mark unno and look forward to taking more of his classes in the future
13921,Mark  Unno,unno was the leader of my fig and he made it quite interesting while the lectures seemed long sometimes he was able to mix music such as miles davis with philosophy and make it totally mindboggling unno knows how to give a good thoughtout speech
13922,Mark  Unno,probably the best teacher ever had he just makes the whole class interesting easy to understand and is very funny
13923,Mark  Unno,amazing teacher taken two classes from him and always very insightful and understandable readings were excellent and the class was easy because he makes it so engaging take a class from him take seven you wont regret it
13924,Mark  Unno,i thought that taking an asian religions course would be semi interesting but professor unno made this class a pain to go to i couldnt really understand what he was saying because he says everything in a philosophical sort of way and didnt really get straight to the point make sure you do all of the readings
13925,Mark  Unno,i thought it would be easy so didnt work as hard as i should have he teaches in stories but is somewhat interesting you have to pay attention easy class but make sure you are not sidetracked and actually try to listen or you will have to relearn everything he says before the tests
13926,Mark  Unno,unno is an amazing teacher i took medieval japanese buddhism with him this past winter he is the funniest teacher i have ever met very down to earth very real personable intelligent and very eloquent in his lectures everybody take one of his classes hell the university should just fire everybody else and let mark unno teach everything
13927,Mark  Unno,a very funny and entertaining teacher with somewhat lack luster lecture material
13928,Mark  Unno,this guy took me a while to figure out but after a few weeks i was completely sold his classes and wisdom actually helped me in my personal life and a lot of the reading he assigned is some of my favorite literature now he is the kind of professor that makes me feel better about paying a gajillion dollars a term in tuition
13929,Mark  Unno,one of the best professors i have had at the university of oregon very helpful
13930,Robert  Werner,he is a very helpful and nice professor
13931,Robert  Werner,what a guy
13932,Robert  Werner,nice guy always there for help if you need it
13933,Robert  Werner,no comments
13934,William  Widen,amazing i looked forward to every class he is extremely smart and one of the leading ucc scholars if you listen to him you will realize he is hilarious and a true gem to pass do the readings and go to class he is always willing to talk to students after class on the bricks so participate in that when you can
13935,William  Widen,elements with sorry this happened to you do the reading take notes of how the justices argue the topics make categories of the arguments historical textual etc do the questions he gives recurringly for final exam practice attend class he reviews information talk to him after every class about class and write down his views
13936,William  Widen,he is the best professor at um he is smart classes are boring sometimes but it would be good to learn miss practice classes the most important check the outlines and read
13937,William  Widen,nobody knows what he wants to teach in this class there is no syllabus no grading information no battle plan to attack the class his lectures are boring and his sense of humor is lacking and annoying his final is straightforward but no one knows how he grades and how he came up with his inconsistent grades i will avoid him
13938,William  Widen,his classes are fun and entertaining really smart guy but kind of disorganized in his teaching methods extremely practical you are not clear as to how to study for the exams
13939,William  Widen,although he was a nice man and very intelligent the way he conveyed the material was very unorganized i studied so hard for this exam and felt completely dumbfounded on the exam he gives true or false questions on the exam that are extremely tricky and in no way indicative of how good of a law student you are he needs to change his methods
13940,William  Widen,horrible textbook that he is writing and emails the sections out as he writes them he is a horrible teacher hard to follow all over the place and not clear take this guy if you have the choice
13941,William  Widen,confusing unclear kind of all over the place
13942,William  Widen,smartest professor at um he is extremely detailed because in addition to being a genius he was actually a partner at cravath so he practice experience he likes you to be exact and sometimes he goes really deep into problems that be on the exam he an easy grader either hilarious and makes you think hard cool guy to talk to
13943,William  Widen,hot
13944,William  Widen,phenomenal instructor he knows contracts and he knows the ucc he just teach theory he teaches the class in a practical realistic way and he forces us to think the same way done more than most profs to show me how the law and lawyers work in the real world
13945,William  Widen,contractshad no book focus on the ucc and the restatement buy crunch time to follow the course and to do practice problems skim over the cases to understand what concepts and what part of hte ucc and the rst he will go over in class do not focus on the cases
13946,William  Widen,poor very poor
13947,William  Widen,great professor he knows the material and enjoys teaching it exam was straightforward i would suggest using though
13948,William  Widen,very good professor always willing to talk outside of class his exam was tough as expected but he gave us one of the essay questions in advance so that was more than fair his and multiple choice questions were tricky though
13949,William  Widen,best prof ever he was a partner at cravath so he has a real understanding of business law if you are tired of the of other classes and the disconnect between what you learn in class and what do in practice you will love any class taught by widen exam is difficult but exactly what you expect no cheap tricks
13950,William  Widen,professor is very smart but does not do a good job of conveying the information which he knows attendance really matter and you can get a good grade even without going to class but he expects you to know everything he covers relies heavily on the ucc very hard grader
13951,William  Widen,very smart and def knows the material problem is teach it to you calls on students classmaster or takes volunteers but use socratic will expect you to answer your own questions bad choice for such a crucial subject a shame he is very smart and entertaining but the combo is wasted potential on
13952,William  Widen,the test was a lot better than i expected but not easy never went to class only read gilberts supplement
13953,William  Widen,favorite professor of the semester very cool very hard and sometimes hard to follow but overall great
13954,Norma  Chase,make sure to go to class and write down how to do her problems if you go to her office hours she tries so hard to help you even though sometimes her explanations arent the best you can easily get a b even if you fail the final
13955,Norma  Chase,professor chase is passionate about physics which can be seen by her marked enthusiasm during lecture she does a great job of explaining different concepts as someone who has always dreaded physics since high school professor lectures made physics bearable and in some cases even fun
13956,Norma  Chase,if you go to class expect to do well even though attendance mandatory it can feel like a waste of time but if you bother listening understand the material better especially come time for the final if you do well on tuneups and the appendix hw then do fine on exams and the final exactly the same thing
13957,Norma  Chase,the class is easy if you just do the supplemental tune up homework to study for the exam as they are exact copies of each other norma herself has some quirky characteristics about her and lecture is like a random dimension and makes no sense just do the homework for the extra credit and you will get an a the final is like the appendix though
13958,Norma  Chase,good teacher make sure you go to class because the problems she reviews in class are the same on the exams and she does not record her lectures there are exams mastering physics homework and a final exam which is cumulative exams are all multiple choice some true or false
13959,Norma  Chase,she is so off the wall and hard to follow entire grade is based off of exams masteringphysics and one final it her exams are all multiple choice and super specific to how she teaches if you dont write down exactly how to do her problems good luck
13960,Norma  Chase,if you go to class and follow along and do tune up exam problems you should be totally fine final can be brutal because not like the tune ups but with the easy tune ups already have a high average to cushion for the final
13961,Norma  Chase,attend her class or you know what doing the notes she posted online posted a day before the exam at that matter does nothing to assist your studies she does not explain her answers through her notes so you have to be in class that day to understand anything that is going on also very confusing during office hour
13962,Norma  Chase,chase is such a nice professor she loves physics many old exams floating around which aids studying her exams are not difficult per se but one must prepare a lot buy keeping up trying problems over and over chase passed me a i averaged a the final lab counts as a test grade too and i think i got roughly a avg got me a passing grade i was a senior and went to talk to her though
13963,Norma  Chase,chase taught me absolutely nothing in her class everything i learned was mostly through past exams.legit though find past exams cause her test will most definitely be the same exact thing just different s the appendix hw are ridiculous and impossible but they will help you on your final if you are studious with it final was a killer
13964,Norma  Chase,tests challenging final was ridiculous
13965,Norma  Chase,professor chase is very enthusiastic she loves physics her constant nodding and running across the room kept me thoroughly entertained i learned a great amount in this class
13966,Norma  Chase,she has crazy eyes and makes no sense the homework is ten thousand times harder than her tests boo
13967,Norma  Chase,very enthusiastic about physics very weird twitching habits especially with eyebrows but overall a nice teacher physics is really easy but physics is very hard
13968,Norma  Chase,wierd lady the exams are easy but the final is like times as hard as the regular tests just make sure your prepared for that
13969,Norma  Chase,um yea this class is really easy at the beginning but gets very hard at the end norma is a very interesting woman id have to say
13970,Norma  Chase,she tries really hard to teach us the topics but still is not really clear the course is pretty easy in the beginning but definitely gets a lot harder toward the end and the final is a killer labs are also a waste of time
13971,Norma  Chase,she is nice but does not teach in any kind of reasonable way
13972,Norma  Chase,no comments
13973,Norma  Chase,no comments
13974,Ned  Barden,professor barden is amazing lots of extra credit provided and gives awesome memorable examples which helps to understand the material and how i studied awesome professor
13975,Ned  Barden,one of the easiest classes at mcp as of yet for me would take him again if i could i cannot recommend him enough study the slides and do great on the exams all mc extremely easy a lab is also much easier than freshman bio labs
13976,Ned  Barden,ned is an easy professor just review the slides before the exam and you will get an a he gives numerous amounts of extra credit if you pay attention in lecture then reviewing be much at all there are old exams and study guides to prepare you easy a
13977,Ned  Barden,he was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam
13978,Ned  Barden,awesome professor he made micro interesting such a genuine and funny guy he really cares about his students and does a great job portraying the material all of his lectures are online which helps with exams so much would take him again if my major required me to great dad jokes
13979,Ned  Barden,we had a paper and a poster which was typical for this class and not horrible made the paper due in the middle of the semester which worked well for me however with assignments and due dates he was inconsistent and changed them frequently i mind getting a later due date but wish he would make up his mind
13980,Ned  Barden,absolutely loved ned his lectures made the subject so much more bearable than it normally been so funny and his tests are basically his powerpoints i hated the lab but he had nothing to do with that such a great personality gonna miss the guy
13981,Ned  Barden,lectures are helpful majority of what is covered in lecture will be on the exam he posts study guides past exams to help you prepare for each upcoming exam there are many extra credit opportunities if you take advantage of it something wrong with you
13982,Ned  Barden,his dad jokes are amazing
13983,Ned  Barden,great professor you need to study and show up to class but if you study his powerpoint slides you will do well on the exams he makes lecture fun and he jokes around a lot one of the best teachers at mcphs and he genuinely wants you to do well he gives some easy fun questions on exams sometimes for extra points i would take him again
13984,Ned  Barden,barden is amazing he explains micro without torturing you like some other teachers he is more keen on you understanding the larger picture and wants you to apply logic also during his exams i loved his lectures his hilarious so that helps and always open for you to pop up during office hours for extra clarification hands down my fav prof
13985,Ned  Barden,barden was by far my favorite teacher he is hilarious and makes microbiology interesting easy to understand and lectures boring you dont need book all tests could be done right off of his slides amazing professor
13986,Ned  Barden,barden was awesome and did a great job of making microbio interesting very helpful especially when you talk to him outside of lecture the class itself is about the same difficulty as bio and just a lot of memorization of slides there are always free points and extra credit questions on his tests and best of all you do not need the book
13987,Ned  Barden,he is just an all around great person very funny and easy to understand
13988,Ned  Barden,great class great professor i recommend that if you go to class get lecture recordings his exams are pretty much from his power point slides but he says a lot of stuff that on the slide and he will test you on so just looking up the slides on bb wont help that much
13989,Ned  Barden,dr barden is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and his sense of humor is hilarious all of the exams are based on the powerpoint slides from lectures and he provides study guides and practice exams just attending the lectures will probably earn you a high grade and the lectures are for the most part interesting
13990,Ned  Barden,prof barden is hands down one of the most amazing professors i have ever had his class is interesting and humorous and the exams are very fair his lab is also very interesting and the most fun lab i have ever had this class hands down was my favorite class at mcphs so far he is a very fair grader and is always willing to help his students
13991,Ned  Barden,i was in microbio class such a sweet guy soo nice and very intelligent grades very fair professor knows his stuff
13992,Ned  Barden,i love this guy hilarious and extremely intelligent never had a professor explain the material so well and what a novel idea for mcphs anyway he actually makes sure to lecture on all the material that will be on the exams
13993,Ned  Barden,adorable easy class and always willing to answer any questions you might have
13994,Charles  Kelley,orgo with dr kelley is great he is such a smart man and know just about everything there is to know about orgo if you show up to class then i would suggest watching the lectures if you do either then going to have a hard time trying to pass this class the masteringchemistry homework helps do it
13995,Charles  Kelley,i honestly understand the complains with this guy i very much liked his lectures even though they could be pretty dull especially in the beginning the material is hard no matter what but there are so many oppurtinities for extra help hours and that curve though he curved so incredibly much it was awesome
13996,Charles  Kelley,lectures the best you mainly learn the material by yourself each exam is cumulative first exam not a lot of people finish he curves each exam but if you want to do well in this class you most definitely have to work for it
13997,Charles  Kelley,dr kelley is unbelievably smart its fascinating how much he knows but he expects his students to know the same the class is very tough need to review all his lectures and the book and do the problem sets if willing to work very doable overall a great person and willing to help if you seek it funny too just pay attention
13998,Charles  Kelley,the class is hard no matter where it is taken and he does try to make it clear what random small things may be on the test which is helpful and he looks like santa so theres that
13999,Charles  Kelley,doctor kelly is extremely genuine and smart if you have a good base in chemistry and read the materials before classes you could understand all of his lectures and average in the b or a range at the end of the year his exams similar to previous exams secretly shared by students and he always gives feedback in afterhours strongly recommend
14000,Charles  Kelley,dr kelley is extremely clear if you would open your ears and pay attention yes just like every class you need to go over notes and study his exams are on par with what he teaches unfortunately an option in this school but an a is just as good here he has a great personality and always willing to help if you need it
14001,Charles  Kelley,he looks like santa claus no joke on a more serious note though his class particularly difficult as long as you spend a whole lot of time studying and memorizing stuff there usually is a curve both on the exam itself as well as for your last grade
14002,Charles  Kelley,he is very nice and wants to help if you go to him for help read the material before class to actually understand what he is saying rewatching the lectures before the test also helps
14003,Charles  Kelley,horrible teacher expects students to understand everything saying however rude and runs the class way too fast
14004,Charles  Kelley,i studied my butt off for weeks before exams books previous tests and still got blindsided and absolutely bombed the tests withdrawing was better than risking my gpa on maybe scale it because he did last year i even went to him for guidance after exam i was talked down at and out of his office talk about not caring
14005,Charles  Kelley,as much as i love professor kelley i dislike his teaching methods if you really want to understand orgo read ahead cause in class he assumes you already have and just starts speaking another language entirely to you memorize everything he writes and i think be fine cause thats what he puts in his paragraphs on the exams
14006,Charles  Kelley,printing out his lecture slides will get you no where live eat and breath the textbook try looking up orgo guides books outside of class they can explain things more simply than kelly and the textbook be careful there is no lab to help your grade in orgo2 like in orgo1 good luck
14007,Charles  Kelley,dr kelley definitely knows a thing or two about chemistry and that enthusiasm shows what he is not great at though is teaching concepts where the textbook comes in and reading the textbook is necessary to do well in this course listen to him when he says to make flashcards they will actually help
14008,Charles  Kelley,his class though i found it challenging is easier than other schools the key to his class is not to just blindly copy whatever he writes but to pay attention to what he says and take notes on those things while maybe not the most clear instructor one of the nicest people and even once photographed his class for his grandchildren
14009,Charles  Kelley,makes almost no sense does not even come up for a breathe to allow you to ask questions unfortunately there is no avoiding him
14010,Charles  Kelley,dr kelley is a great professor his class requires much textbook reading old exam studying even if trying hard but are doing poorly fear not you will make it out alive my test average was a in orgo ii i think i did a little better on the final i got a d if that puts anything into perspective happy studying
14011,Charles  Kelley,he is great and interesting study everything in the notes and you will be fine do the old practice exams that he gives because they are really helpful he gives so much bonus points that both semester i had averages over
14012,Charles  Kelley,he is a kind instructor he sometimes goes off topic with his notes since he writes them as we go along in class so no class have the same exact notes the material is hard but he teaches it well watch out for his exams there is a ton of material covered and you get about min to complete pace yourself or you will run out of time
14013,Charles  Kelley,i believe this was the easiest class i took at mcp sure his material is challenging but gives what bonus points on each exam come on i had like average going into each final those who complain are just sick of having their drinking time cut into just wait till you get to
14014,Michael  Montagne,he makes the class very interesting and he is an easy grader great elective drugs and behavior and easy exams
14015,Michael  Montagne,this was someone that i actually rightfully trusted to discuss my future in pharmacy i had him for transfer seminar and found him to be one of the brightest informative and moral people a classmate that had him for drugs and behavior said the guy is fascinating i look forward to his class i want all the prep i can get before drug lit
14016,Michael  Montagne,boring good thing i had this class not do i get a refund dont laughwait till drug lit.u will wish u paid attention but do we really have to go thru it twice
14017,Michael  Montagne,despite the fact that his class is pretty easy all really neat stuff you learn this class is definitely worthwhile
14018,Michael  Montagne,no comments
14019,Michael  Montagne,his class is really easy all you have to do is come to class to turn in homework and be fine
14020,Yasger,yasger is a very liberal person and wants to have a good time she jokes alot is loud but makes an immpression unfortunately one day she was gone and we were told something happened and she left our class personally she teach an english class more like a debate class i recommend taking her if your looking to learn eng
14021,Yasger,soo funny she has a lot of their all movie stars haha and secretly married to brad pitt haha super funny love the class its easy if you do all ur work if your lazy then take the class
14022,Yasger,very entertaining class enjoy going to class for each writing assignment she give you an example of what an a papers is be on top of your reading for the quiz there are extra credits i would take her again if she teaching eng but unfortunately she not
14023,Yasger,she is hard but a lot of fun definatly do the reading
14024,Yasger,i have to agree she is a great and fun teacher its true that she talk about her family but she have reasons why she do it and also i took my paper to the tutorial center but they are the one that dont not correct it well
14025,Yasger,she is the best english teacher i have ever had i would reccomend her to everyone i thought this was the easiet english class i have ever taken and she is hilarious
14026,Yasger,she is absoluly the most intresting english teacher shes funny fair and easy if you do all the work you will write papers and watch movies and quizes if you do it youll pass put a time in to your paper and youll get on them i use to hate english but now i dont
14027,Yasger,she is the worst teacher on the earth she will make you hate school for the rest of your life she gives on hate her so much i took my essay to the writing center and instrudtors told me my essay was good but she gave me a d how horrible you can get avoid her
14028,Yasger,great teacher she may seem a little intimidating at first but she is fun and laid back i was deathly terrified of oral presentations but she made it fun if you are afraid of public speaking take this teacher you regret it oh and rumors are true she does let you out early
14029,Yasger,at first she seems like she is going to be easy and lax but as the semester rolls she gets harder and harder she expects everyone to be english scholars and on my first essay she gave me an f and i take my time on my essays if you think getting on her good side will help you it
14030,Yasger,the worst teacher ever way too hard to get a c so imagine an a unless you are an english instructor you can get an a i did not enjoy her class at all instead of teaching she talks about her family
14031,Yasger,i thought she does not like minorities i did not enjoy her class at all she is hard on grading
14032,Yasger,highly entertaining keep you longer than you need to be there simple assignments though they do require work fun class
14033,Yasger,she is very helpful and her class was the first english class i enjoyed before her i avoided it like the plague now i wish she taught more classes
14034,Yasger,she is very fun and funny she loves to tell stories and incorporate them into her topics she made it fun to do the work in and out of class i really enjoyed having her
14035,Yasger,super laid back not too difficult worry about staying in class for the entire class she lets us out over an hour early in class is easy but you have to be able to do the work outside of class in order to do well
14036,Yasger,she is very easy and relaxed she makes life simple for you explains things really well she hates people that are late and she lets you out early she is funny enthuziastic and discussions are fun in her class plus no hw this is not a boring class
14037,Yasger,class was fri the first day she said is too early so class started at after that we got out at making a hour class hours everything else is just as relaxed
14038,Markus  Schneider,he is good as long as you expect what the subject entails the course is intended to cover all the basic aspects of database management systems and the professor does a satisfactory job at it he does teach outdated technologies so beware of that also he will make you work hard and cares about the effort you put in the project overall good course
14039,Markus  Schneider,lectures were pretty unclear and his assignments were pretty difficult if it for his extremely lenient grading probably be failing
14040,Markus  Schneider,boring lectures makes you work too hard for the grade taught an undergrad level course for grad students exams are too lengthy designed not check your knowledge
14041,Markus  Schneider,good lecturer the presentations do get dull sometimes but you expect much from the subject on databases i had a clear understanding what would be on the exam and the grades looked pretty good if you do the expected work then the grade should be high the final project was rather interesting and turned out pretty well for our group
14042,Markus  Schneider,there many actual of the class were presentations held by students the grading criteria was very unclear although he usually gave good grades but be aware all assignments were group projects with the same group throughout the semester
14043,Markus  Schneider,he is really nice at teaching he mind at all even if you go and ask him the same thing thrice can be better he grades well if you write your answers correctly i amd my friends always scored more than what we expected
14044,Markus  Schneider,irresponsible the answer of exam may be wrong you need to check very carefully after you are graded otherwise you will easily get a low score since it is graded based on a wrong answer he is very irrespective to students the standard for project grade is very unclear if you argue with him he will satire you and let you shut up
14045,Markus  Schneider,view lessons online as needed to learn the material because as previously commented he simply goes through powerpoint but it does appear that the powerpoint is designed by him to accomplish course objectives project is huge so make sure you get a responsible group after this class i was definitely more interested in databases
14046,Markus  Schneider,useful course lots of material covered good clarity
14047,Markus  Schneider,really not that bad the lectures were rather boring but the tests awful homework was far more difficult than the lecture made it seem the project is massive but if interested in computer science and programming it should be fun procrastinate
14048,Markus  Schneider,i could have gone into databases research but this guy made databases the ugliest of my nightmares he is dull and boring his lectures are worthless last test was a disaster cover more than half of it in class his tas are worse barely speaking english and grading ridiculously harsh take jermaine schneider is not a good professor
14049,Markus  Schneider,has very good knowledge of subject nice prof
14050,Markus  Schneider,easy a but you have to suffer through boring lectures recommended only for a gpa boost
14051,Markus  Schneider,very helpful course lectures very well structured best prof i have come across
14052,Markus  Schneider,gr8
14053,Markus  Schneider,schneider is a poor educator but he does seem to know the material he changed the weighting of assignments several times throughout the semester which was annoying the class project was far too large in scope and felt more like slave labor since it took hundreds of hours to complete yes really
14054,Markus  Schneider,never attended his lectures because all he did was read them to you from his powerpoint slides is not helpful during office hours likes to ridicule people when they ask questions that he thinks are stupid
14055,Markus  Schneider,this guy came from germany to practice his english by reading lecture notes almost word for word you will get nothing out of class you have to teach yourself how to do the class project and he refuses to put a copy of the text in the library
14056,Susan  Young,your grade depends on how much she likes you instead of how well you do with your work if you are ethnic minority the chance she like you is very high and be discriminated against in many possible ways especially in those areas almost impossible for students to challenge her decision she enjoys breaking hearts for no good reasons
14057,Susan  Young,love susan she is so friendly and so energetic if hard on you it is because she has your best interest at heart she is very approachable if you have any issue with her or her marking such a wonderful teacher
14058,Susan  Young,unclear expectations treats you like a child and listen to anything students say really disrespectful and unhelpful gives good feedback but provide the support to apply the feedback hard marker especially in practicum never answers emails or requests a meeting in person just pray for the semesters that you have her
14059,Susan  Young,susan is a fantastic teacher i understand how people say she but to each their own yes she talks a little fast in lecture but has no problem repeating herself if needed she is understanding friendly and approachable susan actually makes classes fun i find her to be a hard marker whatsoever she gives great feed back
14060,Susan  Young,she speaks really quickly and sometimes hard to take notes but she gives out powerpoints she makes her classes interesting and fun with her silly stories hard marker but gives amazing feed back overall one of my favorite teachers in the program
14061,Susan  Young,this lady may seem hilarious and bubbly the first time you take her class but my oh my is she fake her lectures i like whaat she talks way too fast for you to even take notes barely ever replies to your emails tough in practicum and her exams are way more difficult than u would expect because her lectures or so damn brief
14062,Susan  Young,very hard marker and will fail you for no real reason you can spend nights doing a project and she give a jack
14063,Susan  Young,she made it difficult to ask questions she made me feel like i was an idiot by not understanding she seems veryy intimidating
14064,Susan  Young,the best
14065,Susan  Young,best teacher ever
14066,Susan  Young,hard marker you can write a whole page but she will only mark some biased favours many once tried to talk to her and she stood there looking back and forth around the room while i was talking to her and frankly give a cow lectures are all over the place sleep because she will catch you and make you watch
14067,Susan  Young,she is nice
14068,Susan  Young,take early childhood education diploma at langara college she is the worst and terrible instructor in the world
14069,Susan  Young,she is the worst teacher ever had seriously not sure how she got her teaching degree or if she even has one lectures are random and hard to follow confusing and unfair grading scale just try to pass her class
14070,Susan  Young,ask her about the time she was in high school and got in a fight and ripped off another girls ear
14071,Susan  Young,she is very ramdom you can take notes from her lectures because she stay on any one topic her tests are marked inconsistantly with her own personal bias for each individual favorite person as chair person lazy is the only word that comes to mind her needs are the only one the counts
14072,Susan  Young,a nice teacher and gives a useful amount of information with lots of hand outs
14073,Susan  Young,not helpful all i wish i can say something nice about her
14074,Susan  Young,not that easy to talk to
14075,Susan  Young,no comments
14076,Valerie  Simmons,val knows her stuff teaches it in her own style and lets you know what is expected on assignments follow her notes and advice and you will do well
14077,Valerie  Simmons,great teacher
14078,Valerie  Simmons,she is one of the worst teachers i have had she seems to be going through the change this year she is in a bad mood at least times a week and if you need clarification on an assignment she seems to careless and is bothered that you would ask if your that tired perhapes it is time to retire
14079,Valerie  Simmons,a very straight forward person and explains stuff properly.a nice teacher overall
14080,Valerie  Simmons,she gives very valuable constructive feedback if u ever needed it for an assignment or for practicum she tends to be quite a hard marker but a nice instructor nevertheless
14081,Valerie  Simmons,great teacher extremely supportive made me excited to become a teacher
14082,Valerie  Simmons,great teacher
14083,Valerie  Simmons,nice teacher
14084,Valerie  Simmons,supportive
14085,Sarah  Michaels,best person ever she does get off topic but the things she talks about are so interesting even if everything you say is bull she will still listen and relate it to the class and make you feel smart once i thought a paper i wrote deserved an f and i ended up getting a
14086,Sarah  Michaels,sarah is the sweetest person ever she truly cares about her students and wants to see them succeed some of the readings were interesting and some of them i care too much for most of the assignments were interesting but they were really unclear use your plas they will be a resource she expects consistent participation as well
14087,Sarah  Michaels,sarah is an enthusiastic teacher but is incapable of presenting anything clearly many class periods she will forget to go through her powerpoint presentation that contains important course material expect lots of discussion but nothing of any significance
14088,Sarah  Michaels,the best professor had at clark very smart passionate about what she teaches and very approachable i read other comments and as if they had a different professor go figure the one i had was absolutely wonderful
14089,Sarah  Michaels,sarah is one of the best professors at clark she is enthusiastic about teaching incredibly intelligent and very warmhearted and helpful she is very inspiring and i would reccomend any one of her classes
14090,Sarah  Michaels,sarah is a very enthusiastic teacher and she does let you get your thoughts out but she really has issues with getting off topic i get really frustrated with how little we actually end up covering in one class period i feel that if she could only get her style of teaching more disciplined she could be great
14091,Sarah  Michaels,sarah is a great person and a very easy grader but that make her a good teacher although she did know what she was talking about she never really passed that knowledge on to the majority of the class everything i learned was through my pla in sections there was also a huge amount of difficult reading
14092,Sarah  Michaels,the class started out good but then she seemed to totally get off track i have no idea what she taught us in the second half of the semester however extremely lenient grader
14093,Sarah  Michaels,enthusiast warm intelligent and very willing to help outside class
14094,Sarah  Michaels,she sometimes has no idea what she is talking about all she does is read off her powerpoint slide she is really nice and sweet but she cannot teach she is not very clear about what she is talking about and goes off topic the only thing i liked about her class were the chocolates she brought for the class and her easiness on extensions
14095,Sarah  Michaels,sarah is one of the most excited and positive professors i have encountered though her classes seem a bit disorganized she is always willing to see students point of view shes a great person to work with outside of classvery helpful so nice
14096,Sarah  Michaels,great
14097,Sarah  Michaels,not a big fan sarah she teaches nothing in class i spent hours with the study guide and found i had wasted my time when i took the exam
14098,Sarah  Michaels,terrible
14099,Sarah  Michaels,really vague and very flaky however keep this woman in mind when needing recommendations or someone with a degree to back your opinion she rocks in that way in all one of those really accomplished people who has trouble communicating with her classes
14100,Sarah  Michaels,great
14101,Carol  Turner,i was a student in ms class some yrs ago i was new to bc and canada i found her to be a sensitive and caring individual she was understanding and supportive i found her to be well prepared for class and was thorough in her subject matter i had a solid base to my ece training thanks carol
14102,Carol  Turner,no comments
14103,Carol  Turner,great teacher very supportive and helpful very clear how much she loves and respects children
14104,Carol  Turner,a very nice teacher and gives valuable information on books and literature for children
14105,Carol  Turner,she is a terrible teacher she picks favorites and marks you according if she likes you or not she has no idea on what she is teaching she needs to learn more about children before she teaches others
14106,Carol  Turner,yep she picks and chooses her favourites
14107,Carol  Turner,no comments
14108,Carol  Turner,she she like you good failed one of my essays.i handed in the exact same essay to an other well known hard got a high mark.she teach know what she is expect to learn anything from her if she likes be fine
14109,Carol  Turner,i say enough about what a wonderful teacher she is
14110,Carol  Turner,yet she preaches to be kind to children and that teachers need to be caring and giving once you get to know her you will realize that she herself so kind and pleasant to her students.she also picks and choses students she wishes to help and not

14113,Celia  Sgroi,i took this class online over summer session there is no textbook but expect a lot of reading of minilectures and articles the discussion posts a week take the most time to complete but i did get a on all other writing assignments because she is a pretty easy grader i would recommend this class for an upper level gened
14114,Celia  Sgroi,take this class for you last gen ed i took it online over the summer while taking another class and working a week and still got an a seems like it might be a lot of work but it really topics can be depressing at times but they are interesting usually a fair grader
14115,Celia  Sgroi,she wrote the book so guess what be buying it however you will only read about pages so buy it from a student who took the class last semester not the best teacher i ever had but not the worst teacher either very intelligent woman
14116,Celia  Sgroi,dr sgroi was one of the best professors i ever had the privilege to learn from a true mentor
14117,Celia  Sgroi,no comments
14118,Bruce  Sun,where i do begin this guy i think he is old and senial personally what he so called teaches in class makes no sense and he has these long random pauses in between thoughts he even explained a problem in a foreign language during an exam and looked at us like we had the problem only benefit is open everything for exams
14119,Bruce  Sun,i deserved an a in this class i was the only person who participated on a consistent basis and even corrected professor at times he gives out participation points times randomly he gave me a b because i missed one of those days i got an a on my work yet i got a b in the class he royally screwed me over i should have a person above him
14120,Bruce  Sun,super easy never thought i would get an a in stats tests are open book open computer plus he give a test review with all the answers test questions straight from review easy
14121,Bruce  Sun,horrible cannot teach yells at students and constantly belittles the class by comparing us to his chinese students he did not curve for our class but the class average is an f by giving us free points either way did not learn anything stay away from this professor
14122,Bruce  Sun,worst teacher speak english hard test although its open book if you want to learn anything about statistics dont take this guy also he gets mad and shouts at students
14123,Bruce  Sun,worst teacher speak english hard test although its open book if you want to learn anything about statistics dont take this guy also he gets mad and shouts at students
14124,Bruce  Sun,he sucks only take him if you love to study on your own
14125,Bruce  Sun,wow this dude cant even speak english he is living proof that they are willing to give anybody a teaching credential the tests arnt that hard if you study its one of those classes that you have to teach yourself though
14126,Bruce  Sun,teacher is no english no how teach do not take his class unless you like to teach yourself his lectures are boring he tries to explain the concepts and formulas without examples he is not clear at all his tests are hard and the questions have nothing to do with the hw most of the time no what he is doing
14127,Bruce  Sun,the last person comment needs to take esl yourself i understand the paragraph
14128,Bruce  Sun,sun needs a translator to teach in the us he should take esl himself before teaching others i can still vaguely remember his incessant mumbling that maybe only he thought was actual language being spoken impossible to understand he could have been speaking amazonian or latin for all we know
14129,Bruce  Sun,this class is probably the easiest statistics class hard to understand but if you know how to study on your own be fine just study the homework for the tests
14130,Bruce  Sun,oracle is hard enough instructor was not helpful at all the book great either i learned by working together with other students
14131,Bruce  Sun,impossible to understand difficult material and expected workload is far too much however some tests are openbook and copying hw is a must since he does not check it received a b and learn a damn thing
14132,Bruce  Sun,the worst teacher ever lots of homework test are hard does grade on curve because everyone fails
14133,Bruce  Sun,homework is too long you understand what he says he dislikes you if you disagree with him if he like you he gives you zero participation points not that many ways to participate in his class he just rambles a lot about nothing
14134,Bruce  Sun,the homework is like pages long and you never understand what saying no point in going to class
14135,Arnold  Kaminsky,he made this class as painless as possible always helping you with your research pretty funny so the class was enjoyable so if looking for a professor that a pain go for it
14136,Arnold  Kaminsky,i walked out of this class not learning a thing he gives pop quizzes so you have to read the books which are so boring funny i actually enjoyed the class all we did was watch youtube videos the little work you do have he is such a hard grader and very unclear on the actual assignment all of us were always confused on what he wanted
14137,Arnold  Kaminsky,dr k is a pretty funny guy and very reasonable on assignments and grading he really likes his upper division students and even brought us pizza easy b but an a will require just a little effort
14138,Arnold  Kaminsky,super laid back pretty simple class read take quiz some papers a group presentation at the end the the final paper very nice man i would definately recomend him and this class easy ge
14139,Arnold  Kaminsky,very approachable.he really likes it when you participate in class discussions.can be confusing when giving instructions for assignments.assignments really make you think but doable.not a hard grader but read the assigned readings because he does ask questions
14140,Arnold  Kaminsky,interesting professor lectures are boring movies are alright go to class because he does take attendance when he sees a lot of empty seats exams are either multiple choice or essays which he gives you the questions beforehand
14141,Arnold  Kaminsky,i like the guy very helpful wants his students to succeed he tells you what he wants if you follow him you should get an a he posts his slides online some of my classmates got by without reading the chapters i about the countries to help with the midterms finals and papers he takes attendance but not everyday
14142,Arnold  Kaminsky,great professor an easy class if you do the following listen learn and pay attention to detail in what he expects on papers a very fair professor and is willing to help a student at anytime i highly recommend him
14143,Arnold  Kaminsky,not a bad professor by any means but did not pique my interest in se asia what angered me about him was that he seemed to really enjoy making students as uncomfortable as possible at times especially when he knew that no one had actually done any would not recommend unless you have an inherent interest in se asia
14144,Arnold  Kaminsky,just look at the powerpoints he posts on beachboard and be okay for his exams rarely used the books he a video during classes he does care about his students so be afraid to ask him anything he tends to give the same grade you get on your first exam on the rest of your exams so do well on it
14145,Arnold  Kaminsky,he either lectures the whole time or plays a video all powerpoints you need are on beachboard which are so helpful for the exams not everyone attends class but he truly hopes his students do well in his classes so he does care about his students not a super easy class but it is possible to get an a i need the books
14146,Arnold  Kaminsky,i had no problem with his class it was a pretty fair class for a course i liked that his expectations too much he assigned book on which you have to write an essay it was a very interesting book the exams were factbased essays as long as you know what happened good you have to know dates
14147,Arnold  Kaminsky,for a lower division class he takes it too seriously tests are essays one essay about a book which isnt too bad quizzes on the textbook are ridiculous he has i believe and picks very specific topics which we dont even go over during lectures which are so boring his grades is a bit tough considering this is a ge class
14148,Arnold  Kaminsky,he uses too many power points and then you get overwhelmed with too much general info and no clarity on specifics that you will be tested on
14149,Arnold  Kaminsky,overall his class was not hard but it definitely be taken lightly he tells you ahead of time what the question are for the final so preparing is all up to you the quizzes are from the book so reading is mandatory he likes to reward those that attend class with extra credit points or a sneak peek of quiz no reason not to take his class
14150,Arnold  Kaminsky,enjoyed the class especially enjoyed the documentaries the second half of the semester professor piqued my interest in india and wwi wwii and interwar period
14151,Arnold  Kaminsky,seriously nice guy helpfull just read the book gives extra credit points oportunity throughout the an easy class just the usual guidelines plus powerpoints are on line but remember to read the book do not understand what the others commentators rated him low
14152,Arnold  Kaminsky,from day one everything is given online assignments are given and even the essay questions for the exams and final are also given on day one he lectures a lot about what to write for the exams so this class should be an easy a or b if you skim the book and go to class also gives extra credit opportunities professor kaminsky is a nice guy
14153,Arnold  Kaminsky,i understand why some students have rated him badly i think he is a cool teacher i feel like i have learned a lot from this class not from the lecture but from study for the exams and i think his grading very fair i think i got what i deserved and all effort i put for this class i recommend to take this class and him
14154,Arnold  Kaminsky,one of the worst professors ever taken at csulb uses powerpoints from years ago lectures are completely useless counts attendance but no point in attending class study the book for the tests because his powerpoints explain anything since probably using them for different classes cancels class a lot
14155,Joan  Sallenger,her class is an easy a and she is a really nice lady sometimes she can be confusing but she is very approachable and will help you with anything you need i would recommend her to anyone
14156,Joan  Sallenger,joantastic
14157,Joan  Sallenger,if you want an easy a take this teacher she a very good teacher but the material is pretty easy that you can learn it yourself homework is extra credit just take her
14158,Joan  Sallenger,she is a sweet old lady who at times tends to forget what she is doing you have go class you dont have do homework you can fail every quiz and show up only on test days to get an a if you know how do the work take this class if you want learn how dont
14159,Joan  Sallenger,very easy class not all that great of a teacher but for math11 you really need one if somewhat good at math and just need this class as a requirement then this is the one for you
14160,Joan  Sallenger,soo boring go to the class before the test day get the review sheet and study that and you should be okay she rambles in class and you have absolutely no idea what shes talking about nice lady but so confusing attendance mandatory and neither is the homework and quizzes take her if youre good at math and can teach yourself
14161,Joan  Sallenger,take her she is very unclear and boring the only thing thats good is that you can only go to test day and still get an a
14162,Joan  Sallenger,easy class she is confusing at times but the material is fairly easy so i worry to much on that she tries to help where she can though her phone and internet frequently goes out offers study guides and homework is extra credit
14163,Joan  Sallenger,she is probably the easist teacher you can get she doesnt take attendance and gives study guides that make the test extremely easy and homework is counted as extra credit super nice woman holds study sessions if you are having trouble take it
14164,Joan  Sallenger,easiest math class ever attendance is not mandatory and homework is extra credit you can even make up one test at the end of the year granted she is not the best teacher but the material is so easy and the tests are as well that you do not even need a teacher take her if you are not good at math and just want an easy a
14165,Joan  Sallenger,she was easy if you know what you are doing a good review for if you already know the stuff test are easy and quizes are too homework sucks but is extra credit attendace count neither does tardiness she is confusing though
14166,Joan  Sallenger,quizes attendance and homework are optional i didnt do any of it i showed up on test days only and got an a dont take her if you dont understand the matterial ahead of time she will just confuse you she is a sweet old lady and she was helpful if you needed it she called me her mystery student i never went to class but got an a
14167,Joan  Sallenger,easy you dont have to go to class she lets you do hw online and its extra credit weekly quiz dont count if they hurt your grade at the end lets you retake or make up a test of your choice.test are from quizs and she makes copy of quiz with answers on them no excuse to not have an a
14168,Joan  Sallenger,she was very scatter brained and off topic all of the time her tests were easy but suggest her to friends
14169,Joan  Sallenger,this woman is insane she has no idea how to teach or what she is talking about it is impossible to learn from her and i will be sure to never take her again
14170,Joan  Sallenger,easiest class and teacher in the world.i never came to class on time and never missed nothing shes a sweet lady but she tends to ramble on about nothing easy watch her on her basic and mental math she tends to get confused but she makes everything simple
14171,Joan  Sallenger,wow this lady is crazy she wears the weirdest clothes and never wears two of the same shoe if you have taken algebra before this class will be simple i only went to claa for the tests and got an a because i knew the material she makes a lot of math mistakes so its hard to trust what she says she lets you retake a test if you want
14172,Joan  Sallenger,the easiest teacher in history i never came to class never did homework and i swear she gave me an a for a test i never took the nicest quirkiest funniest old lady you will ever meet do not take her if you want to make less than an a if you do not make an a you need a cat scan
14173,Joan  Sallenger,well the class was so easy mostly i took the same class in high school i never did the homework just sort of paid a little bit of attention and did fine the tests are exactly like the online review she puts up except that the numbers are different an easy a talk to her she will be more willing to help if she knows your name
14174,Joan  Sallenger,i think she is a great teacher but i really felt i shouldnt have placed in in the first place total waste of time tests were easy got a so far she drops lowest test grade replaces it with a quiz average that stays out of no matter how many easy quizzes you take
14175,Morris  Longstreth,awesome teacher only wish he didnt have to leave for surgery we all miss his teaching def understanding and polite and everything you could ask for of a teacher
14176,Morris  Longstreth,very good easy realizes that not everyone is an english major
14177,Morris  Longstreth,i really enjoyed the the class he always had an interesting story very layed back but focused

14183,Anne-Marie  Arseneault,poor teacher not good at all not fair and not qualified
14184,Everett  Fox,professor fox is extraordinarily knowledgeable however his lectures are invariably delivered at a pace in a very dry monotone
14185,Everett  Fox,very smart very understanding great grasp of and interest in the subjects teaching respectful of different backgrounds and perspectives
14186,Everett  Fox,professor fox is a wonderful person and he is very intelligent he knows what talking about although sometimes the lecture might be a bit boring because he just talk for an hour and occasionally show us images to demonstrate but in general very easy grader and exams are kind of easy too so this is the class to take if you want an easy a
14187,Everett  Fox,professor fox is a nice man but his lectures can be boring
14188,Everett  Fox,smart guy lectures have a tendency to become dull and boring because of his speed of speech though i was very interested in the subject matter i found myself on occasion having a hard time staying awake
14189,Everett  Fox,i really enjoyed having him for class he is a really nice guy and is very helpful when asking him questions i enjoyed the class a lot despite the monotonous voice that sometimes made me want to go to class but since a lot of things mentioned in class was new i tried to stay awake
14190,Everett  Fox,very nice and understanding professor his dry humor is amusing although sometimes i find myself drifting during his class
14191,Everett  Fox,fox is a really good professor but you have to pay attention to catch his sense of humor
14192,Everett  Fox,really nice guy interesting and interested in subject monotoned so try to stay awake makes dry humored jokes which are funny when you pick up on them i liked him take the class its nonthreatening
14193,Everett  Fox,prof fox is very helpful a really nice guy if you want to get into his class but full write him an email he is more likely than most to let you in
14194,Everett  Fox,prof fox is very clearly interested in what teaching and his lectures are made interesting by his passion and by his fabulous sense of humor grading is extremely easy so a plus also prof fox went out of his way to work with me when i had to take the final at a different time an incredibly sweet guy
14195,Everett  Fox,not a difficult class but not the most exciting class either he is a good man with an interesting sense of humor although i find the material a bit dull it definetely is a good class to take if you want a low stress but educational class for bibical text
14196,Everett  Fox,i took courses with fox this semester and i love both of them i learn a lot in his classes and he makes even the driest stuff interesting i definitely think anyone interested in history jewish studies or hgs should take at least once course with him
14197,Everett  Fox,love him easy tester and grader nice guy a little dry but you learn a lot and he really is devoted to his students
14198,Everett  Fox,great class
14199,Everett  Fox,fox is awesome the subject matter can be dull at times but he really knows his stuff and tries his best to make it interesting which helps when it comes to paying attention he is a fair grader and give any busy work take a class with him
14200,Everett  Fox,i really enjoyed the disscussions in this class when i could stay awake great guy but dry wit is a good description he has an unobtrusive monotone voice so super easy to zone out during lectures panic if you get to al
14201,Everett  Fox,i love the class he is very helpful and sending emails for each reading keeps me on my toes with the assignments tests if studied for are very easy
14202,Everett  Fox,boring as heck nice guy though easy grader
14203,Everett  Fox,he has an extremely dry wit so if you do then find him really interesting and funny if you probably be bored to tears but his courses are pretty easy usually take home exams or essays if you go to class and do your work nominally well you should get at least a b
14204,Stephanie  Cawthorne,dr cawthorne is the bomb diggity of a teacher she is extremely helpful and accommodating to those that are truly interested in learning she cares about her studeents
14205,Stephanie  Cawthorne,no comments

14210,Benny  Lo,i like how he was very nosey with my studying and too much on my ass about how im gettin my work done i paid for that class and ended up withdrawing because of the way his teaching style was
14211,Benny  Lo,the benny show hahaha this class is absolutely amazing amazing bcoz u can get an no sweat just show up and listen to his dumb stories cool but rather study on my own than to show up for his class
14212,Benny  Lo,this professor was useless absolutely useless aced the midterm and final but got a b in class for being late was justified but not to him nothing in the lecture involved any material relating to engineering till the final exam and only one question thank god i graduated from devry my high school is tougher than devry
14213,Benny  Lo,this is the worst teacher had in my entire life the work is all online so you can do it all from home but what if i need to learn it in calss well bother because he lecture just an absolutely horrible class
14214,Benny  Lo,made us sit thru one of his cd recordings a waste class was a waste the midterm and final yet got a b grade due to the fact that i was always late about a half and hour and class statistics for engineering did not have one single problem with the exception of the final to due with engineering a nice guy but a real bore
14215,Benny  Lo,waste of money was not helpful at all
14216,Benny  Lo,very very very very easy class but a complete waiste of money
14217,Benny  Lo,jerk.not helpful at all waste your time money
14218,Benny  Lo,never seen such moran professor he should dismiss from the shool
14219,Benny  Lo,scaryy
14220,Benny  Lo,no comments
14221,Benny  Lo,no comments
14222,Benny  Lo,you can hardly understand him through his thick accent he also taught calculus but it was not beneficial to us engineers as he taught business calc bad teacher avoid him tests are easy but i learn anything and i got an
14223,Azzam  El-Shihabi,is all about proofs of theroms does not grade exam solutions but actual work alert to ti89 users actually grades hw again if you cannot prove it its wrong constantly reminds importance of math profiency in engineering by far hardest professor yet i was the sole student to pass the class of
14224,Azzam  El-Shihabi,this professor does a very good job of writing examples on the board mind that hes always standing in front of them and writes them at lightning speed be warned professor gives no theory or background on subject he never shows up to the lab but can be found durring office hours this was the most infuriating class that i ever took
14225,Azzam  El-Shihabi,hard and goes very fast be prepared you better study your stuff and i sudgest using the asc tutoring center even if just to study pay close attention and either take notes or find some one else who takes them and make copies do pract exams
14226,Azzam  El-Shihabi,uh
14227,Azzam  El-Shihabi,incredibally difficult professor however his class cuts all of the slackers from the program most people take his class twice but to pass as i learned in my semester with him just show up to class most test questions are from hw
14228,Polk,i disagree with the second comment pound for pound prof polk is the the best professor at devry long beach and devry socal over all his real world experience inspired me to start a business i in his class at the time and he still helped me with my business plan a great professor
14229,Polk,he knows what he is talking about in regards to career development but thinks too highly of himself
14230,Polk,terrible professor goes into off topic sports analogies that relate to class makes you earn points with minutiatic exercises too high of standard and none of the materials served us outside of class has an society is against me comp
14231,Dayle  Rosa-Tom,it was great semester that i had so much fun to learn whenever i learned new concept i applied to my job which impressed my boss now i want to study accounting for my major
14232,Dayle  Rosa-Tom,she is very scattered and has a very hard time explaining the subject she may be a good accountant at her job but she is a very poor teacher she assumes everyone is familiar with accounting and that everyone is on the same page she is she is very har
14233,Murray  Teitell,this professor supposedly taught mechatronics to me mechanicalelectrical devices according to the text and curriculum mainly involving controls related to ladder logic all of the labs were recycled from previous courses and did not apply questions often took weeks to get answers and the lecture was completely off subject
14234,Murray  Teitell,awesome professor he is very smart but he plays dumb with the students he is very laid back and wants to help the students out take his class you will have a joke of the day before he begins his lectures a lot of fun i miss being in his class
14235,Murray  Teitell,really great professor taking his class is one of the best things you can do at devry he challenges you ways besides just tests he is not crazy hard yet he does know what he he is talking about and will get you excited about the subject matter
14236,Murray  Teitell,the reason i came to this school he actually teaches physics most teachers of do it properly and are so useless that you could learn as much studying on you own in the same time best teacher i have ever seen for any technical subject and i have had physics and umpteen math teacher in my life he should be cloned
14237,Murray  Teitell,dr.teitell is a great guy he makes you understand the material and that is his first priority exceptional knowledge he is a gift to devry yet some do a disservice to themselves by cheating because he is not a stickler one of the most valuable classes i have ever taken
14238,Murray  Teitell,what to say about this professor does not stress students test are a joke very easy to easy i did not cheat but everyone else did good guy over all trys hard he just dosent hold student accountable for there work
14239,Murray  Teitell,if you dont cheat your an idiot cause everybody else does
14240,Murray  Teitell,not only is he easy but he completely makes you understand the subject one time my car broke down on the road and he fixed it for me knows his way through windows and linux systems incredible memory of programming and data structures asset
14241,Dennis  Johnston,johnston is the sort of teacher that probably should have retired twenty years ago his classes are great if you want to listen to him complain about his personal life for an hour and a half but if you actually want to learn something you better find another teacher he have clear grades and very articulate either
14242,Dennis  Johnston,extremely easy if you take a survey class with him we had one final that was take home open book and no homework fairly entertaining and down to earth as well
14243,Dennis  Johnston,it is a good class if one cares people should not take advantage of a good teacher i know i have poor spelling skills
14244,Dennis  Johnston,dennis is a wonderful professor you agree i love how he sets up his methods classes for open discussion and felt that it as a good way of understanding the concepts as well as his and my peers views and in turn made me think about mhow i would use those concepts in my own teaching i too also like mastery learning making sure the concepts are learned correctly like in conducting that is a vital skill for all teachers and is best that it can be done over until it is done right hard and short
14245,Dennis  Johnston,dennis rules and in love with me probably the most laid back teacher that actually gets kids to work and do a good job how he does it is a mystery
14246,Dennis  Johnston,no comments
14247,Dennis  Johnston,hes pretty cool hes classes are ok he goes on tangents but hes a nice guy and you can pretty much do nothing in his classes
14248,Dennis  Johnston,one of my favs
14249,Dennis  Johnston,watch out for those short shorts of his
14250,Dennis  Johnston,dennis is the best a wonderful teacher and he truly cares about his students he is always there when you need someone to talk to cry to or get advice st rose is lucky to have him
14251,Dennis  Johnston,dennis is dennis very helpful and always there to talk if you are having a bad day all around hes a very caring professor and wants his students to succeed
14252,Dennis  Johnston,dennis is a wonderful teacher he is truely dedicated and makes learning an unforgettable experience his approaches to things are great and he is just downright hilarious dennis rocks
14253,Dennis  Johnston,there really is never a dull moment with dennis around he not only teaches a class but he makes sure that you are learning some of the other nims profs should follow his lead
14254,Dennis  Johnston,dr johnston is an incredible teacher he motivates his students to practice and study by being an honest talented down to earth person all of my classmates agree that other teachers at st rose could benefit from following dr lead
14255,Dennis  Johnston,phd or no phd not a competent educator inappropriate comments egocentric plays favorites full of himself manipulative all talk boring
14256,Dennis  Johnston,there is never a dull moment when dennis is around

14258,Rudi  Hartmann,i took class for introduction to human geography and let me tell you he gets so off topic his tests have almost nothing to do with what we learn in class hence you must read the book but overall he is very a easy grader when it comes to papers and tests everyone got an a on our only paper of the semester
14259,Rudi  Hartmann,rudi is a very nice professor who is passionate about his work and cares about his students you will be required to attend out of field trips they get a little long but are actually pretty fun
14260,Rudi  Hartmann,he gives unclear lectures filled with offtopic interjections and ramblings ppt slides directly copied from the textbook are used for lectures boring classes with zero group projects no creativity i often walked out of class due to being so frustrated i barely studied and still gots on all my papers and midterms a total waste avoid
14261,Rudi  Hartmann,i can say very honestly that i learned nothing he actually discussed what a cowboy is what a cowgirl is the fact that young woman love horses and really anything but geography he was very scatter brained unorganized and unclear three eight hour long field trips so this should be more like a six credit course do not take his classes
14262,Rudi  Hartmann,took rudi for geography of colorado a really nice guy but a little scattered in his lectures he had required field trips which i actually enjoyed they may be prohibitive for some students as it required driving our own vehicles or carpooling far distances ne colorado and vail valley not my favorite professor but informative enough
14263,Rudi  Hartmann,he is extremely nice and very passionate about the subject but is all over the place it is hard to know what to study when test time comes around
14264,Rudi  Hartmann,just read the powerpoint so boring
14265,Rudi  Hartmann,good professor interesting and very easy class
14266,Rudi  Hartmann,he is a pretty easy professor really funny at times i enjoyed his class and his personality the class is interesting and you need to just attend the lectures in order to pass his exams i would recommend this class
14267,Rudi  Hartmann,nice guy but not sure what he adds to his class he uses the power points that the book gives to him and then just reads off it sometimes he will use a transparency that he has written on but his hand writing is completely not legible his ta grades everything his midterm covered of the biggest regions and he broke it down to questions
14268,Rudi  Hartmann,rudi is a great teacher he knows what he is talking about and he is pretty amusing to listen to i have taken classes from him and have done very well i recommend him to anyone wanting to take a geography class
14269,Rudi  Hartmann,you not love this guy loves teaching and is always willing to help you has an oldmanendearing and innocent nature to him always means well and works hard for his students his class is interesting and not too challenging i took world regional geography with him and enjoyed it
14270,Rudi  Hartmann,very good professor kind intelligent informed knowledgeable and committed this was a very enjoyable course i would definitely recommend his courses.w

14290,Satterwhite,good proffessor straightforward on all tests just take lots of notes book tests are easy if you take notes you really need the book
14291,Satterwhite,what a complete blowoff class so easy just pay attention and take some notes and you will get an a
14292,Satterwhite,i had him at angelina his first name is dextor his classes are easy just write down what he says i made in both of his classes
14293,Satterwhite,awesome teacher very helpful study the notes you even have to buy the book
14294,Satterwhite,just write down every word that comes out of the mouth bother with the book he even use it you will have to read extra books but i just skimmed them and still made on the essay tests
14295,Satterwhite,a very knowledgable teacher tests are very easy if you just ready through the notes you have to read two books for this class but even if you just read sparts of them you will most likely make a on the tests i highly suggest him
14296,Satterwhite,we take lots of notes but very easy tests book test that are almost guaranteed
14297,Satterwhite,way cool guy boring lectures but the material is easily understood if you have questions ask if you didnt catch something he said ask him to repeat it he is extremely nice and a great teacher
14298,Satterwhite,in this class you take tons of notes each time a recorder or a laptop will be very helpful
14299,Satterwhite,not a bad class to sleep through
14300,Satterwhite,dexter talks out of this notebook the whole time not exagerating he goes right up to the minute never letting us out early you take tons of notes however tests are way easy and straight from notes the book tests are easy ways to get
14301,Satterwhite,satterwhile was an extremely easy professor although he was rather boring you can do things to keep yourself entertained in his monotonous lectures the class is so easy as is the material i took him as a junior in hs and i had as both times
14302,Dennis  Razze,dennis and this class helped expand my interest in reading and understanding contemporary theatre certain projects could have been more thoughtfully assigned and graded
14303,Dennis  Razze,he gave clear instructions but his grading criteria was not as concise good marks for actual classroom instruction poor marks for time management and grading
14304,Dennis  Razze,i have read with utter disappointment the shallow misguided ignorant rants against one of the best teachers i ever had and i studied with some big names he prepared me for a successful career earns the respect of seasoned professionals and his shows are among the best and he has help shape some of the bestthey come back to work with him
14305,Dennis  Razze,dennis is nice and means well but is iffy as actor and director he does teach you some things but he has very jaded opinions that he presents as gospel so you kind of have to predict those weird opinions and make theatre that fits them by sheer luck to get support in class out of touch with the field which is his biggest problem
14306,Dennis  Razze,mr razze is a funny little man he is a nice guy not much of a professor he was directing when i graduated in and his productions are not really good his class tr is interesting and comes in handy when i play trivial pursuit however none of this is practical he is a really nice guy just not a good professor and even worse actor
14307,Dennis  Razze,the class was uninteresting he was frequently incorrect and i so much care for his humor
14308,Dennis  Razze,is not clear as to what he says know the topic without his notes which are frequently incorrect
14309,Dennis  Razze,sometimes i would love to get inside the little brain to see what goes on but then i realize that a it would drive me insane or b i would get lost and be able to get back out again and c it really that worth it
14310,Dennis  Razze,dennis is a nice person deep down but has no place teaching at desales his productions are not art they are movies on stage he has a horrible work ethic and does not know what professional theatre is like today he can talk all about how things were hu
14311,Dennis  Razze,knows his stuff when it comes to history of the theatre also very thorough in teaching directors what to consider when taking on a play
14312,Dennis  Razze,no comments
14313,Dennis  Razze,deep down i know that dennis is a good guy just a little misguided his classes were boring though you really need to pay attention to pass though runner up years strong yess
14314,Dennis  Razze,i like him as a friend but as a teacher he sucks ass and has no tact but he is a sweet man who thinks of his students as his children when not directing them the yellow jacket is mine
14315,Dennis  Razze,the yellow jacket
14316,Dennis  Razze,buy the book you need it take good notes and save about

14321,Richard T.  Rodriguez,nice guy really cares about his students wants students to succeed easy to talk to
14322,Linda  Polin,dr polin is one of the remaining few professors of education i know who actually give real grades she expects her students to work and think she is an amazing mentor to those who show up to learn she is a nightmare for those who show up to get by
14323,Linda  Polin,linda has a caustic sense of humor sensitive folks tend to dislike her she speaks about highly academic subjects in irreverent ways but really knows her literature if you get over the initial slight and press her she shows extreme interest in your success and learning what more can you ask for
14324,Linda  Polin,linda is very disorganized hard to follow her teaching methods leave much to be desired she help students she dislikes she openly harasses students of certain minority ethnicities and does whatever she can to thin their ranks and keep their achievement low tread carefully she nearly turned my educational experience into a nightmare
14325,Linda  Polin,her organization skills leave a bit to be desired she presents interesting content though
14326,Linda  Polin,you must fit within her agenda

14330,Lisa  Nicholson,presented the subject matter whith great familiarity and a unique sense of style fun down to earth and approachable
14331,Lisa  Nicholson,one of the most dynamic personalities ever encountered she makes a very dry subject entertaining and i learned a lot from her if they offer her tenure brandeis will lose a real gem
14332,Lisa  Nicholson,i sleep well before her class she likes to make you feel stupid
14333,Lisa  Nicholson,i agree with the chip on the shoulder comment she is abrasive and derives joy from making people uncomfortable also she is biased toward the girls by taking passes late for them and not for the guys not cool
14334,Lisa  Nicholson,no comments
14335,Lisa  Nicholson,i am impressed she can walk carrying that enormous chip on her shoulder lighten up
14336,Cara  Garcia,teach the class instead the students ran the class means well but seem knowledgable

14340,Francisco  Balderrama,he is amazing i have taken two classes with him he sometimes has paper assignments but not difficult it is more of your opinion on the matter being discussed in class you learn so much i decided on minoring in chicano studies after taking him my first year
14341,Francisco  Balderrama,helpful clear allows you a good amount of freedom in his papers
14342,Francisco  Balderrama,class material very interesting and relevant very approachable professor very encouraging and nurturing environment readings and assignments are not overwhelming it helps to have an interest in the topics covered to really get the most out of the class highly recommended professor
14343,Francisco  Balderrama,this is the first time i even write about a professor but i had to write about him i took his class in the and he is one professor who i still fondly remember he truly is there to help you get through your courses and give you a and along the way i truly do wish there were more just like him gracias professor all my best to you
14344,Francisco  Balderrama,i thought he was a chicano studies professor i think he should stay there he know enough about history to be teaching it
14345,Francisco  Balderrama,best professor so helpful knows his material makes class fun and project fun not hard at all and his lectures are great you will learn from him easy a
14346,Francisco  Balderrama,awesome professor you will learn in this class and you well love his class midterms and finals are take homes
14347,Francisco  Balderrama,great teacher papers all take home
14348,Francisco  Balderrama,very helpful and quite respectful to every student very clear and concise rubrics gives plenty of time for each assignment mixes various forms of instruction to teach his classes
14349,Francisco  Balderrama,he is a nice professor and its a very easy class
14350,Francisco  Balderrama,great teacher i wish he thought hist bc his class was really easy and informative i got an a and those only come every other blue moon so it must mean he is doing something right you will not regret it at all.take home midterm and final lots of videos lots of free time but you still learn a lot
14351,Francisco  Balderrama,this professor is soo nice and helpful he tells you what is expected of you and also his midterm and final are both take home essays just pay attention and do the work and you will pass
14352,Francisco  Balderrama,great professor the class is not hard at all he is a very understanding person he shows alot of interesting documentaries that will be useful during final keep up with class discussions and read a bit from the book and do good
14353,Francisco  Balderrama,he is a great teacher i enjoyed going to class and listening to what he had to say he is an easy teacher if you do the work
14354,Francisco  Balderrama,i understand all the negative comments i think great we have a mexican nationalist teaching in a us public school something in that for everyone for example i learned a lot about the teaching priorities of mexican nationalists and what a great country this is that we allow such people to teach here
14355,Francisco  Balderrama,just do everyone including yourself a favor and retire already
14356,Francisco  Balderrama,easy teacher and very helpful he gives you points for attendance along with point for group discussions which occur pretty much every class meeting his office is alwayas open if you need to speak with
14357,Francisco  Balderrama,the man of the hour pleasure to have this teacher i was on the soccer team i missed a few times and still passed with a b you can write about what evers in the essays he likes for you to use samples from the book very easy and flexible on the hours emails right back and overall the one to take honestly plus makes class a bit fun
14358,Francisco  Balderrama,how many yawns does it take to fill up one of his classes i always fell aslpeep before finding the answer
14359,Francisco  Balderrama,lectures readings are all useful for the midterm and final papers the more you use them in the papers the better your grade the family report paper is kind of like a research paper but more based on comparing two generations hassle to do yet balderrama guides through the process the family paper its pgs long so dont procrastin
14360,Bruce  Roter,i enjoyed taking theory with dr roter as he was very clear about what he wanted in each paper had a minilecture about each piece in class and was very timely about returning papers and grades as long as you take notes and are in class you will be able to keep up with the workload i highly recommend taking this course with roter
14361,Bruce  Roter,i lasted two days in ear training before i switched not only was he extremely unclear but he also made me feel very uncomfortable when i asked if i could test out of his class depending on the mind you have ear training is either very easy or very difficult he hates students with absolute pitch but many others fail his class
14362,Bruce  Roter,dr roter goes through material so fast your hands will be on fire sometimes he go through the terms we need to know and expects us to know when the test comes up his matching section in tests are vague so the only way is to take a guess unreasonable when the answer i gave was correct but wanted something else deduct it
14363,Bruce  Roter,worst teacher in my opinion
14364,Bruce  Roter,tough but he knows his stuff but you need to let him know if struggling if you gonna fall behind tough grader if you have one blemish on a chord identification points off of the quiz it adds up study and make it
14365,Bruce  Roter,take music theory with dr roter he is a great teacher and as long as you pay attention in class you will do fine he keeps the class interesting and you will learn a lot
14366,Bruce  Roter,awesome teacher the type of teacher you will remember for the rest of your life
14367,Bruce  Roter,take theory with him
14368,Bruce  Roter,words what would roter do wwrd
14369,Bruce  Roter,i have him for graduate classes and had him for undergrad and every week i learn more and more in a very fun learning environment which helps the hard material great teacher overall had him for theory iv orchestration and now form and analysis
14370,Bruce  Roter,great teacher he has a quirky sense of humor just subtle enough to slide by half the class at am while the other half has a everpresent half smile on their face you never know what going to say next but always entertaining also very good at finding new ways to communicate new ideas to help everyone learn better
14371,Bruce  Roter,class is not applicable to what we as teachers need to know and should be offered as an elective rather than a requirement for degree rarely will a teacher need to instruct on how to analyze atonal music to an elementary middle or even a high school it is a college level course which is rare in a typical classroom setting
14372,Bruce  Roter,no comments
14373,Bruce  Roter,i love dr bruce roter
14374,Bruce  Roter,i love dr roter funny and expects the very best from everyone and is a very active believe in us living up to our full potential
14375,Bruce  Roter,i hated him for dictation but then we got along in theory i would always make comments just to rile him up and now i love him hahah hes just funny and a really smart guy
14376,Bruce  Roter,i find roter strangely sexy and i know why maybe i am attracted to his intelligence
14377,Bruce  Roter,dr roter is extremely intelligent and has an intense grasp of the musical world backed up with a great passion for music he also has a good sense of humor although nerdy at times and sets a high standard that encouraged me to do my best very interesting classes
14378,Bruce  Roter,dr roter has a great sense of humor that he incorporates into his teaching he gives an a properly balanced class of learning and smiles great
14379,Bruce  Roter,outstanding professor wants his students to learn and experience the subject hard as all get out but be ready for anything after him
14380,Barbara  Lewis,fabulous professor be prepared
14381,Barbara  Lewis,possibly the hardest classes but lewis is so good worth putting in the extra time and work be prepared for the bar if you take her class
14382,Barbara  Lewis,good command of subjects and ability to communicate them to her students one of the best profs at brandeis
14383,Brady  Rimes,great teacher hard class i recommend missing class it will kill you
14384,Brady  Rimes,no comments
14385,Brady  Rimes,drive a cadillac through the forest and you will be fine seems hard at first but go to class and take good notes
14386,Brady  Rimes,a great teacher his assignments build on each other so make sure you understand as you go and start the assignments the day assigned my first c was in his class and i changed my major to business but good for computer science majors if you want an easy course
14387,Brady  Rimes,great proffessor and treats all students the same
14388,Brady  Rimes,very good at teaching and making you practice
14389,Brady  Rimes,on of the greatest professor in this department i enrolled in every class he taught because it is a guarantee that you will learn he does give a lot of work and all his classes are a challenge
14390,Brady  Rimes,good ole my favorite instructor by far
14391,Brady  Rimes,dr rimes is the best lecturer in the department a good guy to talk to during office hours as well the only concerns i have with him as a teacher is that sometimes his assignments are unclear and he seems a little disorganized with his paperwork your hw and tests
14392,Brady  Rimes,no comments
14393,Brady  Rimes,i liked him thought he was an excellent teacher at first i found him slightly unapproachable but after i had to go to him for help he was great and helped me out just get behind in class
14394,Brady  Rimes,dr rimes is an excellent professor he follows a simple philosophy of jumping right into the subject matter this teaching method provides for a better overall learning experience
14395,Brady  Rimes,exceptional professor exceptional person always excited to be in class cares about students very easy on the eyes
14396,James  Robinson,i took a variety of classes from doc robinson when i attended emu including interracial comm a white chick if you have issues re feeling uncomfortable because white due to his class maybe you should check yourself as far as coursework i felt it was challenging yet fair and doc robinson was always available for appointments
14397,James  Robinson,no comments
14398,James  Robinson,he is an absolutely terrible teacher do not take him
14399,James  Robinson,good new guys i heard retiring he is boring and useless he has cancelled class about times and does not notify us a commuter and he is not considerate at all to his students
14400,James  Robinson,he is literally the worst teacher ever had in my entire life
14401,James  Robinson,i have never hated a class so much the professor is totally useless i agree with everyone else and their negitive comments forget about asking for help if you have a choice take this class with him
14402,James  Robinson,i would not recommend him he is easy gives easy assignments and grades pretty easy but you will not learn a thing we talked about prejudice and stereotypes all semseter he has you do the work for him a lot of the time you work a lot in groups which is pointless for that class he is unorganized unclear and boring
14403,James  Robinson,um did someone say retirement because thats exactly what he needs to do sure he use to be a great professor he explain anything needs to realize somethings just can be elaborated on class has potential discussions were ok.but overall i think its probably my worst class yet here at emu.be weary of this class if you dare take it
14404,James  Robinson,says you can only be a if you are white pretty much hates on white people all class whole class based on no variety not helpful grades unfairly ridiculous assignments wont check or respond to email unorganized he lost my term paper this man is biased and stay away
14405,James  Robinson,by far this is the most wonderful teacher i have ever had he is caring funny sweet helpful everything yes he may not be clear about some assignments but he is willing to help out the best he can this professor puts a smile on my face everyday i would recomend him to everyone
14406,James  Robinson,i had the worse experience with this professor out of all of my communication professors he explain his material and is very unclear on every subject i wish i had known about this site before i took him because he is the worse and to add insult to injury he has the nerve to make us writ in apa style and he even know what it is.i
14407,James  Robinson,this guy litterally borders on racism the entire semester we talked about stereotypes and i kept leaving class feeling like a lot of what i heard was how evil i am because white further he refuses to fully explain his assignments and he really explain anything very well at all
14408,James  Robinson,very easy but also very boring class was based around stereotypes for the entire semester it gets old after a while case studies are also pointless take it with someone else if you plan on getting something out of the class
14409,James  Robinson,what the heck was the point in me taking it he is boring and the material was pointless
14410,James  Robinson,worst teacher i ever had in grad school out of state but found this site and thought i should share this with everyone i got an a but it still worth it
14411,James  Robinson,i found him to be both uninterested in his students and in the subject matter he spent the entire semester reiterating the same exact communications theories every other com class at emu teaches with nothing new or even remotely insightful to add doc robinson on the dangers of dogmatic thinking intolerance and ethnocentrism yet i have found him to be one of the most dogmatic preachy intolerant and closeminded professors i have ever had
14412,James  Robinson,good teacher inter racial is a fun class
14413,James  Robinson,omg his classes are so not hard just do the reading people and take notes then memorize his defs the pts of certain concepts etc he like slacker students so take him if you give a
14414,James  Robinson,at first i thought he would be hard and he seemed hard to understand as class progressed though its very easy to understand what he wants he wants for his students to express what they are reading and learning from his class.as long as you appear to be mindful of others you will have no problem
14415,James  Robinson,he was a good profcommunications is a majorso stop your whining
14416,Diane  Sandhoff,loved her as a clinical instructor classroom was wonderful she made everything interesting and soo clear
14417,Diane  Sandhoff,great teacher and my favorite aunt
14418,Alexandre  Avdulov,his language courses are extremely tough and i have seen students cry during the oral exams he is very caring with those he believes to be making an effort but he is harsh on others take his class if you want to focus on your core courses hardest course taken and i may fail it
14419,Alexandre  Avdulov,avdulov is one of the most caring profs at smu he legitimately cared about your grades your attendance and your happiness in class but his class is difficult extremely difficult required an immense amount of dedication time and effort his grading scheme is vague thought i failed until i saw my grade very stressful
14420,Alexandre  Avdulov,he is visibly enthusiastic about the content he teaches which always makes class enjoyable he brings in people multiple times during the semester to teach us first hand about japanese culture which was really interesting and broke up the lecturing the only thing i hated was the mandatory book we had to read so boring confusing and tedious
14421,Alexandre  Avdulov,avdulovsensei will change your life his classes are rigorous although not necessarily difficult to do well in dedication and attendance are mandatory however if you put forth the effort he will make sure you get an a in his course he is both professional and enthusiastic and integrates both japanese culture and language into his lessons
14422,Alexandre  Avdulov,took this class language with him again saw two sides i recommend this to everyone its very light fun an amazing person and professor and is very passionate about japanese language and culture if you took japanese with him but not this be afraid of this like a totally different prof in this class then what he is in jpns
14423,Alexandre  Avdulov,seen two sides of him he is very passionate about japanese culture and language as am i however as a language professor his course is very rigorous and demanding requires a large time dedication regardless of your willingness to learn the language and this may interfere with other courses if taking this as an elective doing bsc
14424,Alexandre  Avdulov,i am not sure why some people did not like him he is a fantastic teacher who knows alot about traditional japanese culture he is strict but very nice and helpful got an a and i am happy with that
14425,Alexandre  Avdulov,absolutely phenomenal professor he is extremely passionate about what he teaches and is dedicated to helping you receive the best mark possible that being said do not expect a bird course by any means quizzes are frequent and rigorous and you can expect to be diving into kanji by the end of your first semester
14426,Alexandre  Avdulov,avdulov is a fantastic professor if you put in the effort and are dedicated to improving he will do anything to help you reach your goals however if you skip classes or slack off you will get no love from him those who left comments about rudeness were likely in this category work hard and take it seriously and class will be great
14427,Alexandre  Avdulov,expect a bird course from him pay attention when he says something will be on the test write down everything that sounds like a key term and take an interest in the course notice and go above and beyond for you short with people who deserve it be a lazy student in his class especially introductory japanese
14428,Alexandre  Avdulov,best prof had so far in my studies he takes genuine interest in his students success the likes of which never seen he will move mountains to help a student learn the language if that student is genuinely interested if they then nothing he can do for them highly suggest avdulov sensei if you want to learn the language
14429,Alexandre  Avdulov,avdulov is the best if ready for the challenge of learning a new language take him his teaching style is awesome and super helpful if you really try hard and he sees that love you if you do bad on a test let you retake it be basically the exact same so you can ace it definitely the best prof for japanese
14430,Alexandre  Avdulov,good professor pay attention to the terms and phrases covered in class some in japanese because be on the test very helpful and personable
14431,Alexandre  Avdulov,to the person who said rude and not a good prof wrong sure he have patience for the people who try and are forever behind but their fault not his if you actually want to learn the language take him very nice funny and helpful if you try and make sure you learn he really loves what he teaches
14432,Alexandre  Avdulov,amazed at the good comments i had him a few years he was horrible rude to the students and just a huge jerk i would never ever take another class with him again ever
14433,Alexandre  Avdulov,recommend taking japanese from avdulov if you are actually interested in learning the language and are willing to put in the time and effort that requires his classes are always fun and interesting and if you work hard you will learn a lot honest and if you do poorly let you know
14434,Alexandre  Avdulov,is the best i think language is a thing that you have to work hard and he well helps to do it
14435,Alexandre  Avdulov,a wonderful prof so glad i had him teach me japanese two years in a row he was extremely helpful and understanding of me when i was having issues and he expects only the best from all of his students full of interesting little facts and amusing stories he really just wants everyone to do their best
14436,Alexandre  Avdulov,this guy is this guy made taking japanese more than just an anime thing he is great as a person and very interesting his stories are hilarious if it was any other prof i dont think i would like going to university if it wasnt for this course but take his class only if your serious he wont sugar coat things
14437,Alexandre  Avdulov,too many anime morons take this course complain wake up people learning japanese a bluehaired adventure full of chibi eyes and giggles a lot of hard work avdulov is a challenging prof always honest with you about japan and your work work hard waste his time and help you in every way possible ganbatte
14438,John  Everett,really cares about his students and makes sure you know all the time that he is willing to listen during the class and after the semester is over he says he hold attendance against you if or less classes but he does class is work heavy at the end just reading through the whole class and then all the assignments are due at end
14439,John  Everett,attendance required expects participation
14440,John  Everett,outstanding professor he truly cares about the students and really makes the class interesting the assignments are fairly graded and make you think about the material in an interesting manner i would highly recommend one of his classes to anyone
14441,John  Everett,this is perhaps the most relevant class i took during the mba program he wants you to participate in the class so make sure you do the workload was reasonable the classes were enjoyable and he makes learning the material fun
14442,John  Everett,nice guy hardass on participation and attendance but gives good quiz notes and prepares you well for projects
14443,John  Everett,took him a couple of years ago when i was doing my mba for strategy of the firm or something like that great teacher class was really enjoyable especially the mock business and the different teams that we were divided into earned an a and received an email from him afterwards thanking me for my participation and work in the class
14444,John  Everett,plays favorite so just ask him to the bar or stuff like that also if a hot girl easy a
14445,John  Everett,great class great prof make sure you participate big on that suck up and get an a if not a talker then this class is not for you

14456,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,great teacher really connects with the class and makes any topic enjoyable does require some work here and there but it is worth it to have her as a professor just do your work and go to class and you will get an a
14457,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,giampetro is the best professor at loyola our class met on saturdays but she made it fun she is hilariouis for the most part the couse material is interesting i highly recommend her
14458,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,one of the top professors at loyola made a subject i had no interest in at all fun and interesting challenged me to change my way of thinking and was pretty successful in making me see other perspectives outstanding
14459,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,great professor enjoyed every class
14460,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,absolutely the most honest straightforward prof ever had understands the whole balance thing for adult learners great prof love her

14462,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,professor giampetro is honestly the sweetest lady ever she gives a reasonable workload and is constantly there to help you listen to people that say she pushes propaganda and is bias she lets everyone in the class say what they feel and is willing to listen to all opinions take her if you can you regret it
14463,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,professor giampetro is the one of the top two professors at loyola she makes the class fun to learn and makes the entire class excited for each and every class she also has an understanding that most graduate students are busy outside of the classroom also great feedback
14464,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,professor giampetro is a great professor she has real life experience she brings to the classroom combined with respect for her students as individuals she is cognizant and flexible when it comes to the balance and workload is reasonable yet challenging
14465,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,she is one of the best professors i ever had she makes the material fun to learn and makes you want to come to class the workload is reasonable and she understands the balance
14466,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,i had her for the glass ceiling course i found her very well organized and she selected good readings she did not push her ideas on you but rather had you think about the subject matter and make your own decisions i would highly recommend this elective
14467,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,an academic with no real personal experience in any of these issues if you want an easy grade and work is paying anyway why not
14468,Andrea  Giampetro-Meyer,she is not a teacher she is a propaganda pusher and a manipulator liberals and will love her nonliberals and should drop her class asap for good reason because she is not a teacher and your tution money is being wasted she should be forcibly removed from the school this is a jesuit institution not college park
14469,Francis  Martini,horrible class night class and he kept us the whole hours everytime class was boring could get done in hour what we did in must go to every class takes attendence and partipation quizes every week final project most of grade group work during class makes it more liveable has a really bad underbite felt like a driver ed class
14470,Francis  Martini,keeps the classes interesting even plays games with the class very friendly and likes being a teacher too bad most professors at loyola anywhere near as good
14471,Jushan  Bai,no comments
14472,Patrick  McMullen,humorous and amusing in class very difficult to work with outside of the classroom and does not offer additional support or assistance grading appears subjective as there is no rubric and little constructive feedback on assignments
14473,Patrick  McMullen,pat is one of the most amazing and approachable professors wfu he genuinely cares about student learning not grades and inspires students to take learnings beyond the classroom a real asset to the facility of the university i would definitely take him again if possible
14474,Patrick  McMullen,nice guy made class interesting pay attention to the small tidbits asides as he finds a way to include them on the exams
14475,Patrick  McMullen,good professor went a little fast at times which was hard for us people but all in all a good class way better than quant
14476,Patrick  McMullen,great teacher great class great tools
14477,Patrick  McMullen,heard this guy sucks via email but since i never tried i comment on that he told us he was brief thoughalmost as to forewarn us i though he went out of his way to help us understand this stuff actually we had extra tutorial sessions that he absolutely have to dobut did the final was tough but the semester he was fine
14478,Patrick  McMullen,turned what could have been a great course into a trainwreck twofaced refused to answer students questions in class at a student hour he should be ashamed
14479,Patrick  McMullen,cb demos were very helpful his lectures were a little dry his grading was way too tough for a credit graduate class he treated us like high school students
14480,Patrick  McMullen,nice guy but class amounts to nothing more than long drawnout crystal ball he messes with the lighting in class constantly during these also he has different expectations for performance levels between his quizzes and tests a tidbit he will not mention to you until after the fact
14481,Patrick  McMullen,two personalities a friendly face in class and nasty and mean comments through email
14482,Patrick  McMullen,no comments
14483,Patrick  McMullen,i just wish we would stop talking about rennie stennet otherwise ok and he smells good too
14484,Jonathon  Bradshaw,mr bradshaw keeps things interesting thats for sure could go into a little more detail in lectures but he knows what talking about possibly hundreds of years of experience and is one funny man a great guy and a good prof overall
14485,Jonathon  Bradshaw,well what else can be said how can you add to perfection one of the best professors ever had be prepared to work hard for your grade not handed to you on a plate for his class he should be teaching more classes and clinicals as his knowledge of nursing is precise and endless other tutors should take a leaf out of his book
14486,Jonathon  Bradshaw,great sense of humor keeps me awake while going through sometimes boring content also wonderful nursing anecdotes that show the humane side of the profession a very likeable and intelligent person and a great teacher
14487,Jonathon  Bradshaw,really super guy great personality and made boring stuff really meaningful puts up with too much crap from noisy disrespectful students needs to crack the whip more on the idiots
14488,Jonathon  Bradshaw,no comments
14489,Jonathon  Bradshaw,no comments
14490,Jonathon  Bradshaw,ok teacher
14491,Jonathon  Bradshaw,no comments
14492,Ronald  Weber,hes a very intelligent man and he knows his stuff he will push you but as long as you stick with it then you will pass the way he teaches will prepare you for graduate school make sure you do your best and dont procrastinate remember your degree is no free ride dont take anything he assigns for granted and you will be ok
14493,Ronald  Weber,weber is a freaking amazing teacher did his layers of rome trip thought it was going to be a party you go over there to learn i learned more in one month with him than any other professor a tough grader expects a lot from you and is truly one hell of a teacher if you want to learn take this class if you want an easy a keep walking
14494,Ronald  Weber,you can get an easy b if you read and complete the assignments on time and completely a hard grader and the professor will grade based on how well you understood the readings and subjects for that designated assignment
14495,Ronald  Weber,he expects your to log in at different times to the discussion blog and reply to at least peers with a minimum of words he even grade most of the things he has his ta grade nancy she is a freaking hard grader she does not cut any slack also he assigns a homework assignment every week due on tuesday at get him
14496,Ronald  Weber,a senior set to graduate in the winter of the first time i took humm i received an f the closer i got to graduation the more i wanted to retake the course in order to get rid of that f so i decided to register for the online version of the course biggest mistake of my life never been more stressed out over a course
14497,Ronald  Weber,worst class i have ever taken he is condescending and not easy to work with in the online class he calls out your discussion points in red that do not align with his philosophy and makes you feel like dirt when asking for help i wonder if he even likes doing his job. pompous and grumpy stay away from this class if you can
14498,Ronald  Weber,i felt so discouraged after this class i always thought when things are a myth there is no right or wrong answer sorry but to him there is only his right
14499,Ronald  Weber,of the most frustrating experiences in my academic guides seem slight or opaque in regards to the assignments which were disjointed in regards goals if we were able to discern feedback was critical being constructive often irrelevant or inane
14500,Ronald  Weber,not quite sure how what he does is considered teaching more like unencouraging terrible
14501,Ronald  Weber,worst teacher i have ever experienced he rarely gets off his high horse to actually help students learn his views which are a must and if you prefer thinking outside the box good luck because he allow it there were several email threads over the semester with complaints about his attitude and teaching style avoid at all costs
14502,Ronald  Weber,i wish i had know about his online course before taking it the worst experience ever
14503,Ronald  Weber,this class was horrible online and i would not recommend it to anyone no lessons tough with a very freestyle type of teaching style there were several student complaints during the semester about instructions given
14504,Ronald  Weber,do not take this class online hie pretentiousness is unbearable and he rarely provides feedback to help you understand so you can develop as a student his lectures are unclear on the blackboard software and never get where you are supposed to go with your comments because of this senior with a gpa just do it
14505,Ronald  Weber,teaching via the socratic method is bs in a greek literature class i like teaching myself
14506,Ronald  Weber,weber is a great teacher the class is a bit difficult but if you read and have a terrible group you should do well weber is great at keeping you interested and probably the best teachers had
14507,Ronald  Weber,he is a good teacher in the beginning of the semester he will break the class up into groups if your group sucks your grade could go down a couple of points read read read that is the only way to get a good grade and make sure that you do the quizzes those are easy and at the end attendence is added to extra credit
14508,Ronald  Weber,i think that weber is the best professor that i have ever had of course keeping up with the readings is vital to your grade goes without saying but he is the best professor you can ever take he is an inspiration
14509,Ronald  Weber,he helps you keep up with the reading tasks by giving you quizzes he sets up the class in groups and that works out great at first he annoyed me but later in semester i came to understand what a good teacher he is if you are new to college responsiblities he will be challenging he prepared me for future college demands and i learned the value of studying in daily increments instead of
14510,Ronald  Weber,i had him in then transferred to utaustin i had great profs at utaustin but weber is still my all time favorite and most memorable he is truly inspiring
14511,Ronald  Weber,the class is hard if you read pretty much it if you are interested in learning which is why you should be in college then enjoy him i also went to the rome trip with him same work load worth the time and
14512,Daniel  Kern,great teacher taught very well was always willing to help if you had questions his tests are appropriate for the course and pick ridiculous problems you are fine as long as you do the homework one of my top math teachers
14513,Daniel  Kern,homework mandatory which is nice does a lot of examples on the board but makes a lot of mistakes is not a fair grader taking off more points than necessary for small mistakes especially considering how often he messes up on the board overall he is a nice guy though and i would definitely take a class with him again
14514,Daniel  Kern,this teacher was excellent he was always ready for questions on the homework and even encouraged them he helped to the best of his ability and truly cared for the knowledge that he gave his students i hated math from previous teachers but i liked it in his class anyone wanting to take calculus should definitely consider taken dr kern
14515,Daniel  Kern,kern explains everything very clearly and is always available for help he is quickly responsive to any email questions and keeps the class updated on any via email it is evident that he cares about the success of his students very approachable and kind very lenient grader credit available if needed highly recommended
14516,Daniel  Kern,great teacher i found that he was extremely helpful and welcoming to any who came to his office for help he also helped us to better understand careers in mathematics easy grader and offers easy extra credit problems
14517,Daniel  Kern,excellent teacher difficult subject but he is genuinely interested in seeing students succeed taken both calcii and diff eq with him curves tests and usually offers some form of extra credit
14518,Daniel  Kern,i thought based on our homework that the tests were going to be really hard they at all even though i had to drop the class too many other classes stayed to take notes and learn the material even given me copies of tests that given this semester over all good teacher best math teacher ever had
14519,Daniel  Kern,makes a difficult subject into something understandable always willing to spend time to help those confused
14520,Daniel  Kern,assign too much homework but tests are fairly hard of course
14521,Daniel  Kern,always well prepared for classes course material was easy nothing but matrices and everything you do with them amounts to arithmetic and high school algebra pretty good teacher if you listen and take notes little need for extraneous studying are easy mostly computational
14522,Daniel  Kern,cool guy good teacher
14523,Daniel  Kern,his second year after getting his phd and has no clue how to teach upper division course if you try to see him in his office hours he gets pset and keep looking at his watch so you would feel bad and leave he has no clue to do his own homework that he expect you to do avoid him at all cost
14524,Daniel  Kern,daniel kern covers all the material on a basic level and though there is more he could say on the material he instead slowing the class down with long ambivalent pauses you learn much and end up having a hard time with hard material
14525,Tony  Gremaud,great prof however he is a stickler for marking this was however an english course so i can hardly blame him over all he was extremely helpful and kept every class interesting
14526,Tony  Gremaud,he is helpful but picky when it comes to marking tries to keep class interesting overall he was a great teacher and i enjoyed his class
14527,Tony  Gremaud,an online general elective about an introduction to slavery interesting to speak with in person and helpful on writing my final paper showed real interest in the subject and managed to teach effectively through an online system
14528,Tony  Gremaud,really hard marker
14529,Tony  Gremaud,he will eventually be a great teacher but for now he needs a little nore experience
14530,Tony  Gremaud,he is pretty strict excellent lecturer tho very into it hes sexy also hehe
14531,Tony  Gremaud,cant argue with a class where watching tv is given as home work makes u think more which could be good and bad
14532,Tony  Gremaud,tony is
14533,Tony  Gremaud,awesome professor good sense of humour just a nice guy in general
14534,Tony  Gremaud,too by the book and makes very rare exceptions arrogant too sometimes
14535,Dave  Challen,dave is the amazing i love this man i had him in my second semester of fanshawe and he really cares about his students he encouraged me to go to university and i did and love it he is a great man gives you lots of chances to get marks criminal justice with him was one of the best classes i have ever taken
14536,Dave  Challen,dave is a great teacher really got me into the subject of criminal justice and wanting to learn all i could
14537,Dave  Challen,nicest man in the world but wont listen to what you say if you have a reliable source gets off topic sometimes but because of all the class descussions we have only problem is that he mainly only teaches off of power point
14538,Dave  Challen,very dry super nice guy though
14539,Dave  Challen,seems like a really nice guy very much a text book professor lectures are a little dry but he adds a little info to make them better definitely a nice guy though
14540,Dave  Challen,dave is a wonderful teacher he taught us not only the course material but he went beyond the realm of the text to help us learn about life and social issues that we aware of great
14541,Dave  Challen,truly the sweetest man teaching in the graduate and undergraduate level willing to go above and beyond for his students he is everything a teacher should be thank you dave
14542,Dave  Challen,no comments
14543,Paulette  Tandy,her class is a lot of work but it as hard as i thought it would be show up start early study for tests and ask questions if you need to there are pop quizzes but only points each you get to take them with your group and she checks them over before accepting them no reason not to get full credit
14544,Paulette  Tandy,nice prof for exams just study the notes understand everything memorize her tests are more applying what you learned than memorizing but very doable if you study while studying think of examples of the content and how you can write about things talked about the semester long group project sucks if you have a bad group
14545,Paulette  Tandy,dr tandy is a sweet lady this will not safe you however when it comes to passing this class if you work for it tests are very tough and there is really no time to study since the semester is full of incredibly long hws assignments sua outside of class events and activities study early and get ready for tests a long time in advance
14546,Paulette  Tandy,a sweet lady but about the only upside unfortunately she is also one of the worst lecturers ever had spends an insane amount of time talking about inconsequential things and flying through more complicated parts exams are not only more complicated than anything you do in class but also worded vaguely avoid her if you can
14547,Paulette  Tandy,week summer course only take this class if you absolutely need to there is a ton of homework that averages about hours a night mcgraw hill based connect do all the practice the tests are hard but not if you study all the content the last two exams are challenging she provides powerpoints with her speaking professor did all she could
14548,Paulette  Tandy,she is my favorite accounting professor at unlv
14549,Paulette  Tandy,really pleasant lady the class is interesting and it actually made me look more into internal audit but the group project is a huge pain especially if stuck with a bad group have the initiative to ask questions because the instructions are really vague do yourself a favor and team up with good students or be a loong semester
14550,Paulette  Tandy,excessive work and a waste of time learned more from professors at csn than from this woman sua connect homework networking events and not enough time for exams she comes to class smiling but a smile welcoming you to hell also get ready to spend money on class materials not worth it
14551,Paulette  Tandy,had her for internal audit and thoroughly enjoyed the class and her teaching style the exams and group project count for the majority of your grade so take those lightly she provides handouts for her lectures and if you study those be totally prepared for the exams
14552,Paulette  Tandy,took it online over summer that was the first mistake unfortunately i had no other option took her days to respond to my emails even then they were unhelpful mcgrawhill based course which sucks not enough time for the exams and will leave you rushing to guess amounts of homework which take hours of your day beware
14553,Paulette  Tandy,week online acc hmwrk is very time consuming can use check my work suggest getting a perfect score on hw since the tests are hard there is not enough time for the tests answer questions you know and then figure out what you since you will run out of time available for questions via email clear layout of hw and points no ec
14554,Paulette  Tandy,class was online a week summer session not very helpful responds to emails at her convince i had to wait a week to review a test as she was on vacation min is not enough time for tests with depth of work on questions better to take the class during a regular semester with a professor who wants you to succeed not sure she does
14555,Paulette  Tandy,took acc online and was skeptical at first because of the other reviews a great professor and emails right away if you have questions read the book do the practice questions and double check your calculations it helps i got an a on all the exams but you have to really think outside the box on some questions and manage your time
14556,Paulette  Tandy,her internal audit class was an excellent elective that helped me better understand the materials in my other classes the group project had some rough points but she is a very lenient grader she lets you take the iia certification exam in lieu of the final but i would recommend you just take the final her tests are not difficult at all
14557,Paulette  Tandy,great teacher very helpful tests are clear and she prepares you well great at explaining things gives great examples
14558,Paulette  Tandy,actually a decent teacher her powerpoint presentations were very helpful i barely read at all the book is which is ridiculous and she is the only teacher for that uses that book her final test is bs and she curve at all so beware
14559,Paulette  Tandy,overall good class that will prepare you for a career in accounting group project can be pretty burdensome especially if you get placed into a good group so be prepared to spend a lot of time on it acl assignments are difficult and time consuming and worth very little of the overall grade take it only if you are serious about accounting
14560,Paulette  Tandy,took acc over the summer online totally thought i was going to fail because i failed every test but the last one but i still got a c if you do the online homework and study the notes its possible to do better apparently she said she curved the grades good thing
14561,Paulette  Tandy,online warning if you take acc online then know that the mcgraw hill homework will not prepare you for the exams you will have minutes to take the exams it is not enough time exam do the definitions first then the problems exam do the problems with lots of first exam made me drop the course
14562,Paulette  Tandy,i would recommend going to class the material necessarliy hard but the exam review guides are vague and pretty much include everything the sua is time consuming but if you double check with a group for each part you should be fine she is very nice and knowledgable about the profession and what employers look for
14563,William  Jenkins,great professor
14564,William  Jenkins,he is a subjective marker likes you higher grade
14565,William  Jenkins,good luck trying to get anything clarified after the class is over
14566,William  Jenkins,a professor who is very passionate about his work he is very strict about computer use in his class he yelled a few times at students for using facebook the assignments are time consuming and not so easy but he will help with any questions in person or over email a very interesting course and i would recommend taking it
14567,William  Jenkins,this professor is one of the best had at york you rarely come across a professor who cares about his students and believes in potential his assignments are not easy but he will walk you through them and give you a bunch of useful resources you will learn a lot in his class
14568,William  Jenkins,his lectures put me to sleep he needs to be a little bit more exciting
14569,William  Jenkins,the papers and exams are very hard but i worked very hard to get a b in the end but was bellcurved down to a c because the class average had to be
14570,William  Jenkins,all these people have only been talking about the lectures but they didnt mention the exams and paper this course is too much for a year course alot of work and little return.sometimes they ask you the smallest thing that was covered in the lectures no body cares about students because there are too many of them a tells you to ask b and b
14571,William  Jenkins,sometimes his lectures are so boring and unclear that you just want to break the slides as a person he is very helpful but sometimes he acts like i have things more important than you so hurry up
14572,William  Jenkins,he just reads from his slides quotes a lot from famous people but always stutters during his talks and contradicts himself
14573,William  Jenkins,the best out of the three profs for the class he had a very good powerpoint actual words not just pictures and he would explain each point very helpful prof love his lectures
14574,William  Jenkins,outstanding lecturer cares much about his students much better than the other two profs and much better looking
14575,William  Jenkins,great course amazing prof
14576,William  Jenkins,hot accent
14577,William  Jenkins,amazing professor class was interesting and the material is very easy to understand i took this course as an elective and it was mad easy the teaching style is good too and i know a lot of people enjoyed him
14578,William  Jenkins,i find his lectures very interesting and easy to follow my marks are lower in his classes than any other though take his course again because i like what he lectures about and how he lectures he also like black sabbath
14579,William  Jenkins,excellent prof and interesting course material overall great course
14580,William  Jenkins,excellent prof and very interesting course sucked i recommend this class its one of the best i took professor jenkins is very helpful and always willing to help students
14581,William  Jenkins,the material is interesting the text is short and the prof is a hottie
14582,William  Jenkins,excellent
14583,William  Brewbaker,wellspoken highly intelligent professor not terribly outgoing but really nice and helpful if you take the time to get to know him exam is tough but would still recommend
14584,William  Brewbaker,brewbaker sucks boring make sense smart ass no good never ever recommend one of his classes i love healthcare law and he completely turned me off of it boo
14585,William  Brewbaker,starting using the casefile method which consisted of a treatise many property casefiles that were essentially long problems we were responsible for many pages in the treatise very hard to comprehend along with working out the casefiles prof brewbaker has great passion but lacks in his ability to bring his knowledge to the students
14586,William  Brewbaker,no comments
14587,William  Brewbaker,brewbaker can brew some thoughts

14591,Wythe  Holt,wythe is one of the greatest men ever meet he is truly a wonderful person if you get the chance you should really try and get to know him
14592,Wythe  Holt,a socialist he has an irrational hatred of bush and all things a true believer and an honest man personally not intellectually his class is not very hard and will enlighten you but beware trying to indoctrinate you
14593,Wythe  Holt,no comments
14594,Laurie  Ross,by far one of the best class i have taken so far required to write a lot of essays but that is the good part about it you can really see how much you improve from the first essay to the last essay definitely recommend
14595,Laurie  Ross,best professor in the menifee campus very easy and fun class coming from someone who used to hate english i took her for and and now i am her si leader class tutor i highly recommend this class you can get an easy a if you keep up with the work wonderful person
14596,Laurie  Ross,the best english class i ever had her instructions are clear and brief she is a very easy going professor the paper are super easy and you even get to revise it for a higher grade
14597,Laurie  Ross,best teacher ever
14598,Laurie  Ross,this teacher taught me a lot i asked for help all the time and she always helped me the class was hard though i learned and that what teachers are about kindness is one word that discribes lorrie i liked her because she was good at what she does writing and found it easy to talk to her
14599,Laurie  Ross,best english teacher i have ever known she is so helpful and goes above and beyond for her students i would take her for if she taught it
14600,Laurie  Ross,very confusing weekly instructions reprinted from past courses with incorrect dates and misspellings poor instructor she does not seem to comprehend higher level literature
14601,Laurie  Ross,very easy professor lenient grader lets you resubmit two of the essays not a lot of work had to read three very interesting novels gives you ample time for assignments one essay per month learned a lot form this professor do take her
14602,Laurie  Ross,took lit in class assignments are easy homework should be easy but she expects essays to be written like an grader i am an a english student and i got cs on some of the essays i turned into her however she allows you to rewrite papers for a higher grade final was super easy she comes off as rude sometimes
14603,Laurie  Ross,she is good you will learn alot
14604,Laurie  Ross,good teacher hard grader and bad handwriting but still nice
14605,Laurie  Ross,too much work for very few points
14606,Laurie  Ross,she is very helpful and her assignments are clear if you do your work you will have no problem
14607,Laurie  Ross,class had a lot of busy work activities her grading is extremely hard and sometimes confusing
14608,Laurie  Ross,if she doesnt like your writing style your doomed i did not like her because when i asked her for help on a couple of essays she gave me responses and then marked me down for the way she told me to correct them shes nice but dont pick her if your writing style is unique and not to her liking
14609,Laurie  Ross,she is awesome she will bend over backwards to help you great teacher
14610,Laurie  Ross,no comments
14611,Laurie  Ross,i have had this teacher for many classes and she is a wonderful teacher she really helps you write in new and interesting ways she may require some work out of you but it is well worth it
14612,Sam  Marcosson,i would not suggest taking this professor he is incredibly difficult and the exams are impossible
14613,Sam  Marcosson,he makes you work for the grade but he does give good feedback on how to improve also if you participate it can really help your grade
14614,Sam  Marcosson,he makes con law interesting and loves the subject a rare ability to take a subject that he knows about and translate for those who at his level if only more british profs were like him
14615,Sam  Marcosson,had for both con laws very enthusiastic about the material and that makes a world of difference i.m.o look if you are a bigot federalist society type you might not like this class unless you like having your ideas unabashedly liberal but you will learn the material he can be a bit pompous and aloof
14616,Sam  Marcosson,exam was ridiculously hard good teacher and interesting class but often talks down to students slow to return emails be prepared for his grading he gives out a lot of and very specific on exam hour exam by the way
14617,Sam  Marcosson,he was tough but interesting
14618,Sam  Marcosson,if he dislikes you screwed he never responded to my emails
14619,Sam  Marcosson,great
14620,Sam  Marcosson,he was the hardest professor i ever had at u of l but he knew this topic and clearly conveyed it i made an a with him and i was not an a student during law school heard he was really hard for con law and i also heard you learn it
14621,Sam  Marcosson,if he was half as bright as he thinks he is call it marcossun
14622,Wallace  Edgerton,as others have said edgerton is funny but that make him the coolest teacher ever he goes on long rants and requires that you learn his opnions his tests are unprofessional and he can sometimes be insulting to certain groups he is easy and grades on a curve but his class is very tedious your choice
14623,Wallace  Edgerton,wayy cool funny if you actually listen to what he has to say actually knows what hes talking about easy a if you attend class just sit in the front so you can hear him i recommend
14624,Wallace  Edgerton,edgerton is great really easy class he gives out the answers to the test the class before each test so you only have to take notes then he assign homework and he can be pretty funny he lectures all class but it bad highly recommend
14625,Wallace  Edgerton,to the point he is a good teacher if you dont like to study his study guides are not the test to find the anwers to the test will take you a few days he is a good teacher for thouse people that learn by just hearing someone talk sorry dont recomend him he also grades on a curve
14626,Wallace  Edgerton,this was one of the most boring classes ever been to i literally did not take one note except the class before each test he would simply read throught the tests and go over the answers if you mind the ridiculous banter and just want an easy a this is the class for you if you have difficulty attending boring classes do it
14627,Wallace  Edgerton,professor edgerton really knows his stuff he also tells us about his opinions on different matters which makes the class more interesting only exams but when you study the study guides and take notes be fine i got an a in this class
14628,Wallace  Edgerton,he is a really cool guy politics is his profession the mayor of menifee so he knows what he is talking about the class consists of only tests which is intimidating but if you follow the study guide an easy a i read my textbook but needed it to look up terms on the study guide great hilarious man
14629,Wallace  Edgerton,he is so awesome i would reccomend this class and professor to everybody he has tons of knowledge makes the class fun and truely cares about his students i have one more class with him and actually kinda sad its over believe in the revolution
14630,Wallace  Edgerton,his lectures can get boring but you dont really have to show up.i would recomend it since on all exams he had questions regarding his opinion on a certain subject the tests require a lot of reading and understanding of concepts covered in the text even though his lectures are boring he would make the class laugh at almost every lecture
14631,Wallace  Edgerton,the class consists of just exams which are each multi choice he care if you are there or not he only cares about your grades on the exams lectures can make you fall asleep textbook is needed there is a lot of reading for the exams he is a really funny guy and definitely makes some interesting jokes if you catch them
14632,Wallace  Edgerton,we need a revolution edge is the coolest old guy ever he is so funny yes he does ramble on about current events but he challanges his students to think outside of their own little boxes show up for class and use the study guide for an easy a he has inspired me to become politically to make this world a better place
14633,Wallace  Edgerton,listen to the guy three comments down from mine edg is a good teacher he teaches because he wants to not because he has to its a fun and very easy class just write down whats in the margins and bold print follow the study guide and its an easy a
14634,Wallace  Edgerton,reminds you of a really cool grandpa with plenty of stories likes to make jokes and tries to keep your attention by saying some pretty controversial stuff this guy is hilarious pt tests it invest in flash cards because you need to know a lot of info for tests great teacher great man
14635,Wallace  Edgerton,awesome professor he is hilarious great class for night students because he keeps things interesting he definitely shows his bias on everything and wants you to agree but a politician what do you expect examsmultiple choice no graded homework use the study guides and you will get an a guaranteed support revolution
14636,Wallace  Edgerton,rambles on about current events for most of the class and makes fun of students when hes not teaching for final goes throught test ques by ques and tells you answer huge helpful curve take class if you only want to read text and get a cause although entertaining will not help much in class hard to follow to take notes
14637,Wallace  Edgerton,spend the first hour talking about current events digresses so much insane funny old guy with good stories and oneliners study guide has everything you need to know so show up if you want easy a
14638,Wallace  Edgerton,great fun teacher very very funny makes this class fun
14639,Wallace  Edgerton,as long as you took this in high school you should be fine most of the time he talks about the current events going on easy to pass
14640,Wallace  Edgerton,a very wise man
14641,Wallace  Edgerton,very good at keeping students interest and multiple choice tests
14642,Robert  Ebert,this professor was a little degrading to his students but nonetheless he was very knowledgable about the subject there was hardly any homework and the tests were manageable as long as you attended lecture labs let out early often so overall i would say he was a decent professor if you need to get this class out of the way
14643,Robert  Ebert,if into bio this is the guy for you his lectures are a bit dry but he is really enthused about what he teaches had him for my first college semester and one of the best
14644,Robert  Ebert,ebert is a great teacher hard to pay attention to the lectures sometimes but he grades on a curve and offers extra credit i missed the final day and even call him till two days after he took time out of his schedule to give me the test and i passed really nice guy and really enthusiastic about bio
14645,Robert  Ebert,if science your strong subject mr ebert may not be the teacher for you he is extremely nice and wants you to learn and succeed however he expects you to really know every detail and yes the labs are rather loong and unexciting there was choice and quizzes for each lab great teacher but overwhelming
14646,Robert  Ebert,esay for me
14647,Robert  Ebert,bob ebert taught bio to me back in the a great teacher and after over years including grad school he was one of my favorites
14648,Robert  Ebert,one of the best professors ever had he really has perfected the art of breaking down complex subject manner in a way anybody can understand he definitely takes the time to help you take him
14649,Robert  Ebert,he is definitely monotonous but his notes and drawings are usually what are on the tests so they bad he very extroverted but amiable there be problems understanding but beware his multiple choice test where the choice of two or more of the above are true highly recommended
14650,Robert  Ebert,he is kinda boring unless u are freakishly interested in bio very good lectures however he wants you to know the lecture notes cold.tests are kinda hard mostly true you draw pictures.study hard if you want and a but hes a sweet about his students
14651,Robert  Ebert,really nice guy really knowledgable he did care about his students learning
14652,Robert  Ebert,this man went out of his way to help his class learn he really made biology understandable and he even made it relative to every day life he drew everything out on the board and i thought that his lectures and labs were very colorful wonderful teacher
14653,Robert  Ebert,ebert is the worst professor i have ever had simply put his ideas are outdated and his conservative ideals come through a little too frequently lectures are painful
14654,Robert  Ebert,awesome person really nice guy however i agree with the boredom factor he is soo sweet but never meet someone more monotonous in my life torturous but like the others i do recommend him
14655,Robert  Ebert,he is a very cool man who will give you tons of breaks and knows a ton very smart however lectures and labs are soo boringg drink of caffeine before comming to class trust me youll need it but i do recommend ebert
14656,Robert  Ebert,boring but a good teacher
14657,Robert  Ebert,he is a great teacher for he knows a lot and makes real world connections with his area of study
14658,Leslie  Abramson,professor abramson is a fantastic professor he cares about his students so much and you will learn a lot in his class his exams are tough however taking one if his classes is absolutely worth it
14659,Leslie  Abramson,the absolute best professor i have ever had i think it is possible for a professor to care more about his students he is tough but also unbelievably helpful he is a breath of fresh air in the stuffy law school atmosphere funny and very knowledgable he wrote the civ pro book
14660,Leslie  Abramson,love him must take before you graduate no one cares more about his students than les
14661,Leslie  Abramson,absolutely the best not only has he written on just about every legal topic imaginable but he can explain it very clearly as well also extremely accommodating whether going over material outside of the classroom or helping plan your schedule i took classes i had no interest in just so i could take him for a teacher it was worth it
14662,Leslie  Abramson,my favorite professor i had him for and crimproi and thorough witty helpful and knowledgeable exams are difficult but his office hours are excellent and he will give you supplements if you need them to prepare he hates unprepared students so do your reading and use office hours
14663,Leslie  Abramson,if you put in the effort you do well not sure about a lot of the questions on the exam i felt like i did well and got a c but with an open book test you need to study a lot more than you think he has high expectations for understanding material and will get easily pissed if you know the material when called upon
14664,Leslie  Abramson,the best
14665,Leslie  Abramson,i never missed a class made and some in law school and i got a d with him i was all prior to law school but i cared a little less in law school this class held my attention though i learned a lot but be ready for his finals consider yourself warned
14666,Leslie  Abramson,love him very funny so he keeps your learn a lot plus you get to watch cops
14667,Leslie  Abramson,a class act best overall
14668,Enid  Trucios-Haynes,great professor con law is fairly muddled as it is but she does a good job clarifying very helpful during office hours really call on students but likes students who participate so volunteer con law ii was even better than con law i so stick with her very nice prof
14669,Enid  Trucios-Haynes,some like her style one of those people who thought her class was great she teaches conlaw as bar prep not as historical study or philosophical discourse also one of the few people met who make my liberalness seem moderate to
14670,Enid  Trucios-Haynes,apparently it is possible to make con law dull and uninspiring my advice is to bring something interesting to read she notice oh and get the emanuels all in there unfortunately
14671,Donna  Shea,shea is easy and helpful she clearly explains what she expects upfront and then grades according to the critera she set great online classes easy managable and helpful
14672,Donna  Shea,she seemed a little unorganized slow at returning emails and rarely answered the questions i had
14673,Donna  Shea,she is one of the best teachers ever had she really cares about her students and makes each one of them feel special she tells you exactly what you need to do to pass and then gives a chance to redo assignments if you get it right first time
14674,Donna  Shea,caring instructor
14675,Donna  Shea,very good instructor sets goals and lets you know what is expected of you to suceed in her class very good at online classes all future educators should take her classes to learn how to teach in the class room
14676,Gerry  McKeon,he is smart as hell but really teach he just wrote on the board without consideration for the existence or uniqueness of any audience deciphering missing steps from the board was like solving a puzzle and there much value in going to class i went anyway lots of independent learning was needed nice exam very challenging
14677,Gerry  McKeon,a nice guy but he is very confusing at times he writes very quickly causing him to make many mistakes obvious and notsoobvious that will confuse you later the quizzes are ridiculous but the final for this course is a joke
14678,Gerry  McKeon,he works very fast if you pay attention quite easy to follow if you get distracted you miss his explanations and therefore are lost the problem sets were fair as were the midterm and the final the final was exactly like the practice exam allows formula sheets in the tests
14679,Gerry  McKeon,wow he is useless left me confused after almost every lecture probably knows his stuff but teach at all his quiz questions are rediculously hard also the only way to get them is go to a tutorial he always asks the class if its ok and assumes that the silence means it probably is but it definately isnt ok
14680,Gerry  McKeon,such a bad prof class was very borning spent the whole time taking notes but not understanding them his answers to questions left me more confused than before i asked have never seen him without his fanny pack on
14681,Gerry  McKeon,the midterm average was what else really has to be said writes fast all over the board continuously corrected by students however oneonone actually really helpful the any questions thing wont even help you because so confused on what he just wrote and explained
14682,Gerry  McKeon,teaches by doing example after example writes very fast on the board and it can be difficult to keep up with him he does explain concepts clearly though
14683,Gerry  McKeon,not that bad he just goes a but fast i have to agree when he says any questions its kinda pointless top say that cause totally not following whats going on nevertheless not too bad he could be worse
14684,Gerry  McKeon,no comments
14685,Gerry  McKeon,no comments
14686,Gerry  McKeon,the worst prof ever all he says is any questions when he dam well knows he answer it
14687,Gerry  McKeon,set a new standard for unhelpful profs goes at his own rapid pace whether or not anyone is following highly reccommended if you want to become dumber at math
14688,Gerry  McKeon,terrible prof doesnt help students at all answer questions just all around bad
14689,Janel  Sexton,cool professor i liked her style
14690,Janel  Sexton,hard but fair like the discussions eye opening
14691,Janel  Sexton,no comments
14692,Janel  Sexton,a little green around the edges knows her subject material too strick for working with adults
14693,Janel  Sexton,very unprepared in classroom presentations as far as films knows her subject very well assigns an over abundance of homework no flexiabilty for absence from classes to a point of being unreasonable
14694,Judy  Gregg,highly recommended if you take good notes and review them before the exam do well attendance is mandatory
14695,Judy  Gregg,awesome teacher she is fun funny and really helpful bother getting the book it was never used only homework assignments and test which were easy if you paid attention in class and take good notes highly recommended
14696,Judy  Gregg,loved this class i felt that this class should be deemed necessary for all people who ever plan procreate as it may be seen as a guidebook through early childhood buy book not necessary test based on lectures but she is amazing
14697,Judy  Gregg,a really nice smart and polite person she is strict on attendance but the textbook is rarely used since all exams are based on her lecture there are three question texts and research papers that too difficult other than that there any homework take good notes and do fine
14698,Judy  Gregg,great lady but puts a lot of your grade on attendance the class is super easy and fun
14699,Judy  Gregg,fun funny and well organized she is a great teacher taken her for psy also and i enjoy how she maintains the same structure throughout her classes highly recommend
14700,Judy  Gregg,mrs gregg is very nice very thorough she writes detailed notes on the board to accompany her lectures i recommend the buying the book as there is some info on the tests that she put in the notes her tests are bit tricky multiple choice but still tricky i.e one option will be a b only another will be all of the above
14701,Judy  Gregg,judy gregg was an amazing teacher no need to get the book all tests are directly from the notes she is such a sweet careing woman totally approchable and willing to help out her students her teaching method is outlines and labs very highschoolish easy tests multiple choice and common sense
14702,Judy  Gregg,very good teacher there is observation labs test and attendance is mandatory if you want points for it need the book just take good notes
14703,Judy  Gregg,great lady doesnt return emails but the class it great ive taken psych and child devlpmnt with her and she an amzing teacher doesnt use the book at all but all the notes she gives in class are extremely critical come test time
14704,Judy  Gregg,i put into words how awesome an experience her class was i have a little one at home and her chld dvlpmnt class helped so much organized clear and you just appreciate that very much buy the textbook her notes are all you need and some common sense she also has very nice legs
14705,Judy  Gregg,very smart teacher her notes are clear as well as her lectures you can tell she knows what shes talking about her tests are multiple choice but its common sense anyways dont bother buying the book her notes are more informative shes also super stylish i love seeing what shes wearing each class
14706,Judy  Gregg,i had judy gregg for psych as well as child she is an amazing teacher very helpful clear and has great style i totally recommend her
14707,Judy  Gregg,i had judy gregg for psych as well as child she is an amazing teacher very helpful clear and has great style i totallt reccommend her
14708,Judy  Gregg,professor gregg is one of my favorite teachers so far at citrus she makes me really love going to class because she makes it so interesting though it was a waste of money buying the textbook there is a lot of notetaking but worth it because it helps prepare you for tests i love her
14709,Judy  Gregg,great teacher straightforward funny and makes the subject interesting barely used the book tests are on the notes you have to do a few easy observations and some inclass group work
14710,Judy  Gregg,i had judy gregg for child and psy and she was great you never had to read the book or use it the notes are enough her tests are also super easy and you just need your notes to study from
14711,Judy  Gregg,professor gregg is my favorite teacher at citrus so far she is really passionate about what she teaches and will make you feel the same way we didnt use the book alot the tests were easy if you paid attention and study your notes cause the questions are directly from them i wish she could teach all my classes take her class
14712,Judy  Gregg,i was warned by a student that this lady was really hard on you the work was a lot and i was recommended not to take her class but i did i am so glad i took it she is an awesome teacher mentor and person she reminds me of my aunt she is very kind and clear on her notes i do recommend taking her classes.take a chance
14713,Judy  Gregg,she is a wonderful teacher notes are critical the book was never used tests are purely from the notes and observations are done very interesting course material
14714,Carolyn  Perry,taking her class right now and to be honest one word to describe her is unorganized her lectures are all over the place puts up power points for like seconds then moves on i tried to approach her for some help but she looks at me like i was dumb for not understanding the first time hands out way too many papers and does not explain them
14715,Carolyn  Perry,loved mrs perry at the beginning of the semester she said the class would be hard but as long as you read the text and pay attention to her lectures you should pass with flying colors she applies some of her life stories to her lectures which makes it very easy to understand of extra credit opportunities as well
14716,Carolyn  Perry,there are tests final and paper nice and approachable but unorganized be prepared to write really fast always take notes as she often asks s at the end of class and expects you to answer in the form of a short paragraph she also puts you into groups her tests are hard her lectures have little to do with whats on the test
14717,Carolyn  Perry,prof perry is a very unorganized but she makes up for it with a lot of extra credit i can honestly say that if you study what she gives in her study guides then you should be good she require finals for people who have and above and trust me i had like a cause of the extra credit
14718,Carolyn  Perry,skips through power point slides in lecturesthen go back to them but moves on to other power points say much towards slides devastating how she give time to write down info from slides all she says is on blackboard how are we suppose to learn this way we pay to take the class for what to teach ourselves
14719,Carolyn  Perry,get the book her powerpoints have much to do with on the test grades on a curve over all easy class
14720,Carolyn  Perry,get the book her powerpoints have much to do with on the test overall easy class just have to learn on your own
14721,Carolyn  Perry,really nice and funny but she is all over the place her powerpoints and lectures are interesting but rarely have anything to do with her tests she covers alot of material but you know where to start when you study her little study guides very useful either she curves her tests so that helps tremendously okay overall
14722,Carolyn  Perry,very easy class she curves her tests so receiving a b is easy the powerpoints and study guides help much with tests i never read the textbook and still received an a i have a in the clas
14723,Carolyn  Perry,boring instructor all she did was lecture from the book and test what i learned was strictly from reading questions are not welcome
14724,Carolyn  Perry,i suggest reading the material ahead of time from the text if you have it they have it in the library which i used because textbooks are do the extra credit always that means come to class or else you will miss out day pick on people to participate let this scare you away she stops after around the week
14725,Carolyn  Perry,she is very unorganized her lectures and power points had nothing to do with her tests she rarely covered what was going to be on the test her in class assignments felt like they were meant just to take up time do not recommend taking her class she makes an easy class hard with her teaching
14726,Carolyn  Perry,not the most interesting class just the usuall run over notes and one or two in class assignments testing is based on what she talks about this class is missing something to catch student attention
14727,Carolyn  Perry,the best professor
14728,Carolyn  Perry,i loved her class it was very easy to get an a.if you do your h.w class assignments and study it wont be hard at all to get an a there are tons of extra credit assignments i recommend prof perry
14729,Carolyn  Perry,really loved this class a great prof gives a lot of helpful advice for future teachers she always gave back papers tests she does a lot of group work but it definitely helps take a chance and take her
14730,Carolyn  Perry,idk what everyone is talking about great always gave me back all my papers and replied to my emails if leaving a negative comment then that probably means you got a bad grade which is obviously your own fault i got a and it was easy
14731,Carolyn  Perry,this professor is seriously the most disorganized teacher at citrus she misplaces work doesnt respond to emails and shows preference between students if you are going to take her save a copy of all of your work
14732,Carolyn  Perry,i am in her d.e class it is the middle of the week and we still received our h.w yet but we are still expected to turn it in by the same deadline i am really disappointed with this teacher because how are we expected to do good when you short us on our time to complete assignments so frustrated with her
14733,Carolyn  Perry,i like mrs perry i am currently taking her child online class her hw is very easy her website is a bit confusing but not totally unmanageable i have learned so much in her class totally recommend it its easy i have put minimal effort in and have on all my work
14734,Jerry  Giger,dr giger is awesome he totally loves god and his conducting and teaching show that i love this man heh
14735,Jerry  Giger,mm
14736,Jerry  Giger,he is a great prof he knows what he is doing his beard is also very hot and his silver hair makes him distinguished
14737,Jerry  Giger,he is a great prof i like his legs personally but he is a man of god and that comes across in his teaching
14738,Jerry  Giger,the man and gorgeous
14739,Jerry  Giger,nice guy good teacher and conducter
14740,Jerry  Giger,hes hot take him if given the chance
14741,Jerry  Giger,no comments
14742,Jerry  Giger,very respectable conductor however as a teacher he rather lacks in teaching skills
14743,Jerry  Giger,no comments
14744,Greg  Detweiler,not a major but always loved music and dr d reawakened my love for choir he really cares about his singers just be ready for quartets and remember not the end of the world if you have to go in for resings
14745,Greg  Detweiler,my experience with dr greg detweiler made me choose a different career path originally i pursued music as a hobby i graduated from msu with a degree in political science through his support and guidance i now coach voiceover and have a successful career in the arts it started with concert choir and ended with practice
14746,Greg  Detweiler,expects a lot from his choir which is not a degree you can get here he expect you to practice he wants the best from a student which sometimes he sounds rude sometimes racial to prove a point forget to go to class you get downgraded if you miss classes
14747,Greg  Detweiler,dr detweiler can really make a choir sound fantastic however he student leadership run away with itself sometimes creating disorganization and frustration students should not be grading their peers and i feel that dr detweiler should watch more carefully over his leaders when he delegates
14748,Greg  Detweiler,detweiler is genuinely nice and means well with everything that he does that being said he will not let you bs your way through choir a professional and expects you to begin viewing music as your future profession as well bring your music get your notes stop by his office and say hi sometime smile and wave in the hall love you
14749,Greg  Detweiler,i think he really cares but is just extremely awful showing it likes to do everything himself which does not leave much time to help students so you would need to book a time convenient for him look forward to your quartet which is recorded and graded if you are good at sightreading and sulfege you would do well sorry for the newbies
14750,Greg  Detweiler,dr d is kindhearted and passionate about choral music he takes a genuine interest in those students who prove interest in his classes he does not reward sarcasm but delights in respect he expects excellence and prides those who take the extra time to practice their parts outside of regular class time oh how i love to sing
14751,Greg  Detweiler,he is a great man he expects you to practice be passionate and learn fast you learn to do what supposed to and it is a very enjoyable experience he is extremely talented and is the best choral conductor ever met
14752,Greg  Detweiler,this teacher was very passiveaggressive and picked favorites overall his class was not a good experience
14753,Greg  Detweiler,this guy made me hate all choral activities with a passion if you absolutely must take his class please remember that choir everything and ignore all the whining from the choir officers too your life is not gonna end if you have to resing or make s from their stupid fundraisers
14754,Greg  Detweiler,he made me hate choir
14755,Greg  Detweiler,no comments
14756,Greg  Detweiler,i love him understand him
14757,Greg  Detweiler,love dr d oh how i love to sing
14758,Greg  Detweiler,i love dr detwiler a very funny guy and a great teacher however he has some trouble remembering names it took him four times of meeting me to actually remember mine lol
14759,Greg  Detweiler,i really admire his passion about music and his interest in the students a truly amazing and goodhearted person the top of his profession bravo dr d
14760,Greg  Detweiler,dr detweiler has a great way of getting a group to come together and blend for a truly beautiful sound
14761,Greg  Detweiler,i love greggy d

14779,Brenda  Adams,she is a big kid she stays up late playing the legend of zelda sometimes if you want a fun business class look no further this class helps you learn and you will pass if you do your darn work
14780,Brenda  Adams,she is good teacher and very kind individual i introduce her to my son and he said ms adams is the nicest in pcc her bit25 is an important knowledge take her class
14781,Brenda  Adams,ms adams was a kind teacher she tried to improve her slides from the previous semester to spruce things up her lectures can be a bit dull if you know the material already but she is a helpful and encouraging teacher she has patience and the eagerness to help you pass
14782,Brenda  Adams,one of my favorite teachers of all time really helpful really welcoming you cannot go wrong
14783,Brenda  Adams,im hispanic came to class half awake after work ending at to her class starting at loads of extra credit its impossible to not want to try a c student if i can get an a in this class anyone reading this should be able to do the same take here class trust no regrets best teacher hands down ps she is super nice
14784,Suzanne L.  Cross,
14785,Suzanne L.  Cross,class is very easy just show up and do the reading dr cross is not so fun though i think she ever learned how to smile
14786,Suzanne L.  Cross,difficult to relate to intense personality instructional nightmare
14787,Suzanne L.  Cross,an easy
14788,Suzanne L.  Cross,how can a professor be so bad because the social work program is so bad

14792,Moataz  Emam,one of the best clases ever taken teaches you a lot and maintains interest responds well to questions and is available for help any time fair grader scales when tests are too hard and assigns very good hw problems because of him i even took phys gives extra credit wish he taught all of my classes because i love his sense of humour
14793,Moataz  Emam,this guy is awesome to get an a in his class is soo easy i mean it mean gonna learn much but an a is very possible also funny and cute oops did i just say that sweet guy quite entertaining homework is mad short and easy u have a week to do problems extra credit
14794,Moataz  Emam,mildly entertaining lecturer but not enough examples in class and his tests suck if you like multiplechoice exams avoid him if possible
14795,Moataz  Emam,mediocre
14796,Moataz  Emam,not a good teacher for this class basically copies all the examples from the book then reiterates them not accurately to a bored am class meanwhile the tests and homework are using physics we want to meet in a dark alley
14797,Moataz  Emam,he was my thesis advisor and i thought he was awesome he has great explanations and is very helpful you just have to try
14798,Moataz  Emam,great guy he has fun teaching the subject and that rubs off on students granted he loves physics but is bothered us this semester i really recomend him
14799,Moataz  Emam,this class and the homeworks are by no means impossible if you take notes in class.he want to simply feed you formulas he wants you to understand them and their applications and that involves physics sometimes in a word or he is friendly funny intelligent and helpful
14800,Moataz  Emam,he would be a great physics teacher but when he teaches calc he keeps putting physics problems in
14801,Moataz  Emam,he definitely be teaching calc he almost never gives examples with numbers we bought the book and never touch it he never gives easy homework problems to practice with only hard problem sets which are nearly impossible without practice and a big eraser
14802,Moataz  Emam,can not stand this class with him makes me feel stupid ona regular basis and gives homework that is too hard and never gives examples in class
14803,Moataz  Emam,should not be teaching calculus
14804,Moataz  Emam,super friendly man very approachable and excellent with explaining things on the lower level and not too shabby to look at either hehe
14805,Moataz  Emam,he is a great professor very enthusiastic and willing to help take a class with him if you can
14806,Moataz  Emam,no comments
14807,Moataz  Emam,very nice man confusing at times but is always willing to help you during his office hours very very fair grades
14808,Moataz  Emam,no comments
14809,John  Zenger,brother zenger is a fantastic teacher and he really cares about his students even if you like insects you should take his general entomology class it will change your life
14810,John  Zenger,bio is really not a difficult class there are a few tests but all the questions are given beforehand and discussed in class the semester ends with a debate which is pretty fun my only advice and warning would be to focus on the paper you choose your topic after the first week so just keep up with it
14811,John  Zenger,i loved evolution with bro zenger the subject matter itself is pretty easy just read from the text book and discuss in class there is a very large paper you have to write which is a lot of work but you get to choose what you write about so that helps bro zenger is a great teacher and he cares deeply about his students
14812,John  Zenger,great teacher had a lot of fun
14813,John  Zenger,really nice guy class can be a little boring at times but it is mostly because of the material that we have to cover he does a pretty good job of using different teaching methods
14814,John  Zenger,i loved brother zenger he was so nice and willing to help and made class interesting just do the homework and come to class and study for the tests which were difficult but as long as you study its pretty easy loved the study guides and reviews in class
14815,John  Zenger,brother zenger is very helpful and definitely wants you to succeed the homework is easy but the exams are a bit hard so make sure to study for them
14816,John  Zenger,excellent and passionate professor he is extremely willing to help you out in class he really inspires you to think and learn in his class
14817,John  Zenger,he is my favorite teacher one homework assignment is due before each class it takes about an hour if focused we watch videos and do interactive science activities online for lots of the homework assignments i think anybody makes science as fun as he does attending class is important for quizzes you find a better teacher
14818,John  Zenger,the class was fairly easy but the tests were very poorly written it seems to me like he tries to trick you he required a textbook that was only on amazon and we only ud it twice and there were hardly any questions over the reading in the text book i felt like he prepared for class because the class time was not over the prep assignments
14819,John  Zenger,fairly good teacher i enjoyed his classes expect to do homework for each class and trust your original quiz score not only are his multiple choice tests difficult all of the above but he makes the test the day before you take it and fixes any errors after you take it overall nice teacher fairly difficult class
14820,John  Zenger,i really enjoyed taking brother class the homework was not hard mostly busy work doing the homework and attending the test prep sessions really helped me on the tests he is helpful and willing to meet after class if you have any questions
14821,John  Zenger,loves the material is enthusiastic tries hard to create fun activities is very understanding of students and is a push over he cares more about the material than the grade which is good for those interested in the material as well as those who just need the grade he is a great teacher
14822,John  Zenger,origins of life class excellent teacher he was really excited whenever anything new came up or great questions were asked he will answer questions right when you ask them if you talk to him about problems you are having in the class he will help you out with them he gets you engaged in discussions tests do test you but too bad
14823,John  Zenger,brother zenger is great at teaching but i was surprised by his disinterest in the class i would suggest taking another teacher who will be more invested in their lower level classes i felt like we learn near as much as we could have because he was more concerned with his higher level classes
14824,John  Zenger,excellent teacher plan on doing a fair amount of homework and making sure to come to class but learn a lot
14825,John  Zenger,very interesting class easy homework and assignments the tests are so hard though i would study for hours and go into the test and feel like i had never seen the material before the tests do not follow the study guide very hard to know what to study for
14826,John  Zenger,a info crammer pure he will assign a chapter and a quiz after each class which is easy to skate by is unmerciful and lets satan write tests
14827,John  Zenger,he was a great teacher for bio204 once you get use to his teaching methods there is reading for every class with a study guide the tests both lecture and lab follow the study guides and lab reports very closely so if you study it hard to do well on the tests but the tests are all write on and you have to be able to explain fun class
14828,John  Zenger,this was a great class he made us think and come up with ideas that we would never have stumbled upon otherwise he tackled evolution with a finesse that is admirable in a church school i learned a lot in a scientific way and still found strengthening in my testimony highly recommend
14829,Maryann  Sydlik,very good professor so sweet she seems kind of hard nosed at first but once you get used to her very nice and extremely helpful taken lower level physiology courses before this one and got very good grades in them but i really understand the subject until i took her class
14830,Maryann  Sydlik,if you work hard she will help you anyway she can shes a great teacher get you to know what you need to know
14831,Maryann  Sydlik,teacher was good for most part felt like she treated class like children rather than adults we are
14832,Maryann  Sydlik,expects great things from her students if you give your all you will succeedif not you will not be respected by her weird sense of humor took me awhile to get her i bet fun when she lets her hair down
14833,Maryann  Sydlik,dr sydlik is a great lady and a firm but fair teacher who wants her students to suceed
14834,Maryann  Sydlik,no comments
14835,Maryann  Sydlik,dr sydlik is the best teacher i ever had
14836,Maryann  Sydlik,i thought dr sydlik was very helpful i had her in her first semester and i liked her very much she was very clear and concise as far as treating her students like year olds goes if you are inconsiderate going to let you know about it
14837,Maryann  Sydlik,she treats all of her students like
14838,David W.  Alsop,not at all helpful
14839,David W.  Alsop,a maniac who digs insects a blast to work with bring on more rolling rock
14840,David W.  Alsop,had him for invertebrate zoology and parasitology but sadly not entemology very tough definitely yet you learned a lot and will definitely never forget his classes tests were difficult but fair too bad he retired miss his quirkiness doo da da da dee doo who had him understands and enthusiasm thanks dr alsop
14841,David W.  Alsop,great take him if you can take the heat
14842,David W.  Alsop,he is the devil incarnate i hate him a lot and a lot he ruined my grade for biology and my future with a normal lab professor i would have gotten of lab its a miracle that hes retiring i only wish he did it sooner
14843,David W.  Alsop,took this class over because of him and got out of on the lab with diff prof dont even take this dude
14844,David W.  Alsop,thank god not teaching lab this semster this son of hairless lady is hard
14845,David W.  Alsop,no comments
14846,David W.  Alsop,advice to people who are registering for him for lab you will never get a good grade i guarantee you he loves labs and goes into too much detail for and parasit hes very interesting hes a tough grader though you study and study and study and you get a but very interesting and enthusiastic abt his work
14847,David W.  Alsop,great professor keeps you interested very quirky fellow if you like to breeze through a class he is not for you his tests are very hard but ask around you can find his old exams and they are almost identical
14848,David W.  Alsop,alsop is the g.o.d of bio at queens he is very fair and a lot of fun to work with i wish every professor had the enthusiasm of this guy
14849,David W.  Alsop,this is the best professor ever if you love him you are a lazy incompetent waste of space
14850,David W.  Alsop,i took credits with alsop and i enjoyed his classes and did well in all of them lots of hard work tho if stupid take him recommend him for nonbio majors
14851,David W.  Alsop,i dont understand why teachign bio he should be teach some kind of mental class
14852,David W.  Alsop,no comments
14853,David W.  Alsop,do not take this teacher he is terrible at doing the job he is paid to do and on top of that he is a mean spirited person who doesnt care for students
14854,David W.  Alsop,he is a terrible teacher so stay away at all costs he will fail u and enjoy doing it
14855,David W.  Alsop,alsop and dervin are the two teachers u should avoid at all costs very tough on grading reads the labs inside and out dont take him if u wanna pass bio
14856,David W.  Alsop,hard but fair
14857,David W.  Alsop,hard we are lucky to have a professor who is so excited about the material and teaching
14858,Savage-Dun,super hard class but she was a great prof
14859,Savage-Dun,she cotaught the class with dr melendez as a result i believe most people compare her to melendez that being said many dislike her because she doesnt spoon feed you everything that you need to know for the tests which melendez does but if youre willing to pay attention during lecture and actually work a little for the class a great prof
14860,Savage-Dun,she is amazing she came around to every single recitation to try to get to know her students enough said she will always be there for you to answer any questions you have and will defiantly try to curve your grade up a bit if she sees hard working and diligent
14861,Savage-Dun,prof katty is great currently having her i do not know why people complain genetic is a challenging subject work hard read the textbook and you willbe ok she has a good knowledge of the subject i do not blame the prof for poor grade but the effort u get what you put in i recommand katty but be prepare to work hard read the texbook
14862,Savage-Dun,i love genetics but am very disappoinetd with this class and professor her lectures are based on pictures taken from text book she will read the captions word for word out of the book she explain anyhting lots of homework problems not covered in class or recitation and on exams how is that acceptable worst prof so far
14863,Savage-Dun,a heavy powerpoint user concentrate on all the material on the slides as they will show up on the tests the problem is that sometimes obscure information shows up on the tests as well very clear and articulate in the lectures but sometimes match the tests
14864,Savage-Dun,lecture is boring she has pictured from textbook in powerpoint and she explains them recitations are very important they are guaranteed to be in the test no reviews so going to lecture gives a sense on on the test she has difficulty explaining thing but go to her office if u need help
14865,Savage-Dun,wish i looked this site b4 choosin her class bc comments r right on target i read every single chapter covered did every single hw problem studied a great deal ended up with b she knw answers most questions asked by students her lectures r useless she uses images from textbook only in slides exams are hard beware
14866,Savage-Dun,horrible please waste your time with this women.take genetics somewhere else.not only is she extremely boring but she is extremely inept as well.many questions were asked by of which she could not answer.she even admitted that she has a difficulty with teaching genetics.very disappointing considering her phd status
14867,Savage-Dun,i enjoy genetics but it is not my most natural subject i read the book for every chapter covered in this class and to be frank the textbook was rather useless for the majority of the chapters her lectures derive directly from the textbook with no explanation provided while she is rather approachable she simply cannot answer questions it se
14868,Savage-Dun,genetics class is hard she puts very tricky questions on exam.read every word of exam she uses clickers so you must attend class but you cant take notes in class slides are exact copies from textbook she puts no work into teaching she is a nice person but a bad teacher you really have to study to pull an ok grade overall not recommended
14869,Savage-Dun,the most horrible teacher ever she is not organized help you out and also gives no review sheet places wrong answer keys to previous exams just bad she teaches from the textbook and the exams are hard really hard
14870,Savage-Dun,class was a joke easy bio class just do your work slides are simply images from books so no extra info to remember tests are relatively simple and recitation is easy
14871,Savage-Dun,slides are not helpful n not organized no notes at all
14872,Savage-Dun,great class really simple exams mostly mc
14873,Savage-Dun,very hard and she uses only the slides which are not helpful at all the exams are dam hard
14874,Savage-Dun,this proff doesnt know how to teach
14875,Savage-Dun,the class was so interesting and the subject was fascinating you can tell that she realy likes the subject too also even though sometimes she may seem unapproachable she is very willing to answer questions and appreciates good ones the tests are fair you need to study but not usually ment to trick you.i totally recommend this clas
14876,Savage-Dun,slightly boring lecturer but she knows her stuff and her tests are pretty fair
14877,Savage-Dun,this woman is a condescending mean individual.doesnt care about anything its her way or no way and her lectures are soo boring tough grader and her minons are morons too
14878,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia was a great teacher she always answered your questions without making you feel like an most teachers she was so understanding and caring she is also funny which is a plus apply yourself and you have one problem
14879,Cynthia  Schauer,you have to make sure that you attendant class throughout the entire weeks lecture is something that you want to miss because almost every week you have a quiz due based off lecture taking notes is always the best so that you can go over your notes and be sure to pass your quiz use the book as much so i get it
14880,Cynthia  Schauer,by far the hardest class ever taken this class was so hard i studied all the time lecture is all over the place and it makes it very hard to take good notes very scatterbrained and her lecture is confusing with the powerpoint she makes she help you very much in the lab wish i could explain some more but i ran out
14881,Cynthia  Schauer,she is the sweetest professor she is kind of difficult but if you listen and study you will be fine
14882,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia really makes sure you know she is there to help you at anytime she even came to our study group on a sunday in her personal time she expects you to work at learning not just show up anyone saying a bad professor willing to put the work in tests are a little tricky be careful
14883,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia play she expects you to preread the material before coming to class each day then in class she expects participation she will ask you questions she tries to guide u to the answer but is often confusing how she does it she was very helpful outside of class she seems intimidating but is truly a kind soul ask she will help
14884,Cynthia  Schauer,i loved cynthia and the way she taught her class she lets you know there for you the whole way through you definitely float through cell biology because not an easy subject but if you do the work as she suggests and participate in class be fine so passionate about what she teaches a truly awesome professor
14885,Cynthia  Schauer,i gave cynthia some credit for being encouraging but her tests are ridiculously hard and she is not approachable in lab for questions her midterms and final exams are beyond what anyone should be expected to know and when you ask a question in lab she will only tell you that not correct and walk away instead of being more supportive
14886,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia will see you for what you are take her classes if a check in the box for your degree program but if passionate and actually care about the subject matter cynthia is an incredible leader help you realize your goals she will let you know if you cut out for the field which is a much needed trait in a teacher
14887,Cynthia  Schauer,she is very scatter brained although she knows her stuff her lecture is all over the place which makes it hard to take good notes she makes up and writes her own quizzes with a lot of trick questions so read the questions carefully she will expect you to read and fully understand the class information before coming to class very hard class
14888,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia expects you to already know the material in class before learning when you ask questions she makes you feel stupid and says you should already know the answer and tells you to ask class members for the answer very scatterbrained jumps from topic to topic i learned absolutely nothing from her i learned more by teaching myself
14889,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia is a very great instructor she really does her best to get everyone involved i enjoyed her class very much but not much of a morning person so my brain was only half awake very sweet lady
14890,Cynthia  Schauer,this was by far the worst class of all my classes offered at kvcc this instructor talks way above your head offer any extra credit to help you out and if you let her know you are struggling she will tell you straight to your face that you should reconsider your goals for the future horrible
14891,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia is completely scatterbrained she adds new assignments randomly and due dates change all the time so you get confused by all of her confusion takes forever to grade exams hardly reflect lecture at all talks above what most people even know yet like we are already microbiologists when actually there to learn horrible teacher
14892,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia is a very good professor she is very passionate in her work and knows her stuff if you put in the work and study you will not do well in this class she is the one of the best instructors at kvcc
14893,Cynthia  Schauer,this professor goes too fast and has high expectations
14894,Cynthia  Schauer,professor schauer is a passionate compassionate person she is patient beyond measure and helps students succeed she fosters a place of learning not just spitting out the right answers schauer encourages questions not just perfection she takes classes out of her profession so she understands being person in and out of class
14895,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia is an awesome instructor i am sad this will be my last class with her i took her for both cell biology and microbiology and really enjoyed her class she is super smart and really cares about the students doing well and wont let you give up her lectures are interesting and labs are so much fun
14896,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia is a really nice and knowledgeable lady she use the book so i waste your money she is all over the place when it comes to when things are due or whats going on in the class in general shes really frustrating in regard to any type of class schedule and you have to remind her of things several times
14897,Cynthia  Schauer,cynthia is awesome i never write these reviews but i wanted to for this class because she is fabulous she actually makes the subject material make sense she has a real passion for what she teaches shes very prompt at answering emails and is extremely helpful i am hoping to have her again as an instructor
14898,Milagros  Ranoa,been almost years since my first class with her but she still ranks as my favourite professor her intro course motivated me to change my minor wish i could take her classes again
14899,Milagros  Ranoa,i wish she was still here becasue i would like to take more classes with her i loved her class and her teaching style i miss her
14900,Milagros  Ranoa,easily my favorite professor understanding and helpful and a relatively easy marker intro was hard but past that she eases up and gets to know you quickly i love all of her jewellery
14901,Milagros  Ranoa,beautiful professor beautiful woman so kind and more than fair exams interesting lectures great prof all good things to say
14902,Milagros  Ranoa,nice but dry take notes read text and be fine
14903,Milagros  Ranoa,excellent prof
14904,Milagros  Ranoa,no comments
14905,Milagros  Ranoa,easy easy easy very interesting lecturer and tests are cake i mean really she gives you long answer questions to choose from and you pick two what more do you want
14906,Milagros  Ranoa,very organized and clear in lectures
14907,Milagros  Ranoa,blaah
14908,Milagros  Ranoa,well she is alright but she mutters and dosent know what she is talking about unless she has her notes otherwise its almost impossible to take notes she also jumps from topic to topic not my fav prf by any means
14909,Milagros  Ranoa,hard to get a good mark in her intro course but she gets better as you go and as she gets to know you she rocks
14910,Milagros  Ranoa,hard marker on long answer exams are tough apparently she is a feminist but never really found that
14911,Jim  Whitehead,jim was great and was usually always prepared for lectures he oftentimes went over indie games and how well designed some of them are this helped contribute to our design decisions he met up with each team each week and gave critical brutal advice not all of it was gold but he definitely helped us especially with art direction
14912,Jim  Whitehead,he is a nice guy but should not be teaching game design classes he gives horrible advice that drove our project into the ground he understand games at all if you take any of the senior capstone classes with him it would probably be in your favor to ignore what he advises you change about your game which is to say everything
14913,Jim  Whitehead,good teacher for intro to cmps if you need it for a ge or major his class was very easy notes were all online with everything you needed to know inclass pop quizzes fell asleep many times failed the second midterm and managed to get a b in the class though keep in mind this is more about the history of cmps rather than programming stuff
14914,Jim  Whitehead,jim is a really nice and helpful teacher if you need help on the homework or an extension for a week or so he will definitely let have your time with the assignments really enjoyed being in his class highly recommended
14915,Jim  Whitehead,best class ever got to play video games for homework the midterms were pretty easy and professor whitehead was a very nice and approachable guy
14916,Jim  Whitehead,pointless class dull lectures use book but an easy a
14917,Jim  Whitehead,this class rocked jim is a great teacher he knows what talking about game demos class completely relevant to lecture and they are all great games jim is obsessed with shmups but it makes a good inside joke i had a great time in this class and i am trying to be a ta next year
14918,Jim  Whitehead,gym is awesom he let us play games in class and let us joke about his white head we played on a console pretty much everyday
14919,Jim  Whitehead,so much fun not an easy class but definitely worthwhile lectures were entertaining and relevant to gamers highly recommended
14920,Jim  Whitehead,nice guy very cool obsessed with shmups the work is easy the assignments too bad you can study for the tests for or hours and get an a making the video game is awesome and the top video game creation groups get prizes like an xbox for example if you ever wanted to make a video game take his class especially friends
14921,Jim  Whitehead,this guy wants to make the game design course easy for you though he necessarily know all the answers you can ignore what you get on the tests as long as anywhere near passing the only thing that matters is the final project you must take that project seriously not fake like in other blowoff classes
14922,Jim  Whitehead,jim is extremely nice and understanding a great guy who really wants to make his class interesting those who took and feel he was unclear or stubborn are wrong his notes spell out what will be on the test he published study guides online and encourages discussion on the various topics in class he even let me make up a midterm
14923,Jim  Whitehead,creating video games sounds cool not with this guy very disorganized very stuborn his test dont test knowledge cool guy but sucks as a teacher he came minutes late to our exam had another exam a week before our project was due and wouldnt push it back becuase he wanted to demo the video game for the last few classes
14924,Jim  Whitehead,whitehead is a very clear concise teacher who really makes an effort to make the material somewhat interesting he try to trick you and the class is very laid back and for an engineering class really decent
14925,Jim  Whitehead,really a good teacher able to make sense of the many concepts taught in the course and ask questions on his tests he requires many readings but a very positive thing very effective from a truly educational perspective great teacher and person to talk to
14926,Jim  Whitehead,one of the better teachers in the cs department
14927,Jim  Whitehead,no comments
14928,Jim  Whitehead,boring too much reading for an engineering course
14929,Jason  Carland,i have to agree with the others it was the easiest a that i ever made but if you want to really know the material then you are out of luck he is the only one who teaches the forensic accounting class
14930,Jason  Carland,i honestly believe that my year old could have got an a in this class i still have a clue what forensic accounting is but i have an a on my record
14931,Jason  Carland,does not communicate well with students in his online classes we very seldom heard a word out of this guy but if you want an easy a then go for it of course you still wont have a clue as to what the material means and you may need to repeat the class at a later time
14932,Jason  Carland,jason is a seasoned professional on various levels while his technique of lecturing is everything but lively if you follow what he says and walk off the lecture path with him you learn alot more than with the textbook great sense of humor too
14933,Jason  Carland,no comments
14934,Jason  Carland,a nice guy and decent teacher really likes what he does and is helpful
14935,Barry  Cohen,professor cohen is a great professor honestly as long as you grasp the concepts of any programming language then translate them to the appropriate language that learning good a lot of homework and the exams are all right not too bad
14936,Barry  Cohen,barry is a very good teacher he will adapt his lecture depending how fast the class is going and will give very helpful advice at recitation
14937,Barry  Cohen,great teacher was able to learn they provide labs that you need to do do those and you can basically pass
14938,Barry  Cohen,barry cohen is one of the best computer science professors in njit his use of class time is remarkable except for the times when he goes off into tangents he is very knowledgeable about the material and his use of classroom assistants is definitely made to help students i would highly recommend him
14939,Barry  Cohen,he is a good professor he teaches well although e dies stray off topic sometimes
14940,Barry  Cohen,difficult for me to rate him accurately because i already knew everything covered in cs so i found the class pretty boring prof cohen was still pretty interesting though because he tends to go off on tangents although that might have a negative impact on someone who know the material from which he is digressing
14941,Barry  Cohen,great teacher knows his stuff and knows how to teach people who complain are the ones who did not try and were playing games on their laptops in class
14942,Barry  Cohen,not a very understanding prof seems very nice and very approachable but in reality he is totally the opposite take cs instead cs
14943,Barry  Cohen,unfortunately the class does not use a book and is introductory so basically your as lost as you can be he thinks he covers topics but please you love your gpa do not try it
14944,Barry  Cohen,do a good job teaching in class so the homework assignments are very very difficult not very helpful either would not recommend
14945,Barry  Cohen,knows what he is talking about since he is the head of the department kind of acts like he is all knowledgeable but you eventually understand that he is just good at what he does take him if you want to actually learn something instead of just going through the motions
14946,Barry  Cohen,i had him for molecular evolution bioinformatics and i have to say i was impressed he spoke about genetics and evolution with the greatest of ease pretty good for a cs professor excellent professor
14947,Barry  Cohen,cis became java instead of this semester he was somewhat new to it and made mistakes while teaching but a lot of profs do even though he tried his best and he was a good teacher the best is his practice problems right before an exam which he goes over thoroughly if you know how to solve them you should do very well on exams
14948,Barry  Cohen,take him for and his stuff
14949,Barry  Cohen,no comments
14950,Barry  Cohen,one of the best cis professors he explains very well
14951,Barry  Cohen,he is a very good teacher explains thoroughly tries to help you in any way many corny jokes makes more fun
14952,Barry  Cohen,a gentleman makes learning a new language like very easy which infact could be very difficult extremely helpful and nice guy his jokes are not funny at all take with him
14953,Barry  Cohen,his practice programming parts of his lecture will be on the commons hes very nice and explains things to detail take if you have no clue about
14954,Barry  Cohen,explains material well easy grader
14955,Kim  Specht,although she clearly knows what she is talking about she is not clear when teaching she acts as if you are stupid if you ask questions in class the one good thing i have to say is that she is much nicer outside of class and gladly gives you help if you ask for it only outside of class
14956,Kim  Specht,horrible she talks as if unsure of what about to say she tells you trust me i will lead you there she takes a very long time to get to her point her labs do not relate to what learning from the textbook class mandatory but she will yell at you and say a bad role model if you go avoid her
14957,Kim  Specht,very in class but super helpful and a lot nicer in office hours if she makes you feel stupid get over it just her style
14958,Kim  Specht,she is not direct and it takes her an hour to say a sentence
14959,Kim  Specht,just plain bad
14960,Kim  Specht,worst in the chem department avoid her class if you can
14961,Kim  Specht,no comments
14962,Kim  Specht,she is difficult but you will learn a lot she was very enthusiastic about biochemistry initially she is intimidating but once you ask her for help she will do everything to help you succeed i would recommend her to anyone but be prepared to work hard
14963,Kim  Specht,uninteresting and bring the material to life
14964,Kim  Specht,dr specht is one of the best professors had some students find her intimidating but actually very nice especially if you see her out of class she knows how to write questions that require you to think and apply what you know as opposed to what memorized
14965,Kim  Specht,terrible
14966,Kim  Specht,great dry sense of humor expects lots from you but you learn alot
14967,Kim  Specht,no comments
14968,Rudy  Pyle,decent lecturer but came off as very lazy i.e showing frontline documentaries almost every class and giving the entire class a same grade on papers reference the textbook once but gave a final based on stuff in it that he come close to discussing in class frustrating dislike him personally but not a good teach at all
14969,Rudy  Pyle,good background interesting speaker
14970,Rudy  Pyle,rudy lost me when in class said that only whites can be
14971,Rudy  Pyle,race and ethnicity is a class with a lot of potential but professor pyle just live up to that
14972,Rudy  Pyle,he may seem a bit off topic and pointless at times but he truely is a proffessor that lets the class do the teaching he guides the conversations and discussions at times at times does not if the people are good the class is good if not well blame the professor just read the book do the assignments and participate in class
14973,Rudy  Pyle,took this clas over the summer was a breeze the topics where interesting and i just really enjoyed the class if u are unsure about the ratinngs take him over the summer and i garantee you will like it
14974,Rudy  Pyle,not too bad
14975,Rudy  Pyle,he starts out as a good prof but as the semester progressed he got cranky and grouchy the class seemed really pointless becasue we ended up watching a ton of movies i would not reccoment taking a class from him if you can help it
14976,Rudy  Pyle,professor pyle is awesome really relaxed in the classroom and tries to get people involved with his discussions also willing to laugh at himself and he realizes that people a long time ago forgot how to do that but he still does awesome
14977,Rudy  Pyle,his class seems pointless some of the assignments are confusing and he is not help at all
14978,Rudy  Pyle,actually said in class that blacks cannot be news flash rudy all people are even you suck it up move on work to improve but live with that fact
14979,Rudy  Pyle,good stuff a little odd but alright in general can be purdy funny at times as well
14980,Rudy  Pyle,no comments
14981,Betty  Zacate,professor zacate is the type of professor where her instructions are pretty vague so you need to make sure to ask as many questions as you need to to get things cleared up she gives out a lot of writing assignments which work towards the ten paged paper at the end of the semester for extra credit she also explain the chapters often
14982,Betty  Zacate,nice but not very specific on what is expected she does not use canvas she does not know grade unless you ask and she will give you an estimate rather than figuring it out you need to read the text often to prepare for reading quizzes and when she lectures she speaks in a monotone voice and reads from the book with no elaboration
14983,Betty  Zacate,i still understand why i had to take her class but she does not explain anything basically on your own she gets mad or aggravated if you ask a question that does not go with what teaching that day if you have a question she will make you wait until class ends or she simply says you should have asked me before class
14984,Betty  Zacate,if you have the option please stay away from her and any class she may teach after one whole semester i did not learn one thing of value she treats her class like going to be your major and runs it like a higher level course out of all my years in school mrs zacate was hands down the worst teacher ever had would never take again
14985,Betty  Zacate,super passiveaggressive asked her simple questions and gets confused tried to dumb the question down and ask again and she still was confused not surprised a lot of people dropped quizzes and boring documentaries every week would not take again
14986,Betty  Zacate,terrible at explaining gets highly confused over any questions most disorganized teacher ever had wastes most of the time in the course actually teach just grades would have dropped this class after first class if i listened to my instincts she should be fired i love art and wanted to learn more too bad i had to teach myself
14987,Betty  Zacate,a good person but her teaching skills are not the best she will help you if you stay after class very boring and she can barely hear the tests are difficult but easy to get your grade up i had a d and the final brought me up to b with only question right it was out of over questions
14988,Betty  Zacate,professor class is very easy and it is chockfull of extra credit however she teach very well and makes students do online tutorial quizzes about the content you can keep redoing them until you get it right she also seems to get flustered at any questions that fit right into her framework
14989,Betty  Zacate,horrible teacher with no plans at all she takes attendance at the beginning of class and also after break and she gives points for attendance but not the problem never clear on anything you will be in the dark the entire course she makes you watch old movies that has nothing to do with the course or tests however homework was easy
14990,Betty  Zacate,pretty easy class she takes attendance right at the start of class easy grader and gives extra credit show up to class and take good notes and you will get a good grade class is very boring but she knows art very well got an a in this class
14991,Betty  Zacate,easy class just show up and do the work she grade hard and half your grade is basically homework and attendance tests are not hard either just take notes in class and you even need to read the book
14992,Betty  Zacate,a tolerable enough woman but as a big fan of art she bored even me to tears you have to show up but if you bring a laptop you can entertain yourself on facebook the entire time let you use notecards and make sure you do the chapter quizzes and be fine bring something to do unspeakably boring
14993,Betty  Zacate,prepare to reenter grade attendence is taken exactly at start of class if ur late at all points off takes attendence again after break if u leave points off heaven forbid u speak at all during her lecturing all these points are taken out of your grade i attended and got an a so i am not of those irrate students just mad over a bad grade
14994,Betty  Zacate,eccentric oldschool teacher that actually has expectations of her class god forbid with facebook generation will answer all your questions easy grader interesting class
14995,Betty  Zacate,she was unrealistic about the expectations of her class she wanted to cram and incredible amount of work into a week summer course i dropped her class after day because she talked in circles and had a very strict attendance policy
14996,Betty  Zacate,she is eccentric and boring but very flexible helpful and insightful theclass waseasy
14997,Betty  Zacate,betty keeps it real dig the berets she dons pay attention and show interest old school teacher that lets you use notes for exams
14998,Betty  Zacate,i really enjoy this class
14999,Betty  Zacate,worst teacher her method is very dry and boring you do not actually learn anything she actually made me hate art easy class just read the book and zone her out if you must take it with her i would advise against it plus a real jerk to a lot of students over the smallest things like being seconds late no joke
15000,Betty  Zacate,this isnt a hard class but this teacher makes it harder then it has to be she gets flustered and confused when you ask her any questions the test have material not covered in the lectures and are horribly structured her power points are useless and she goes over things you need to know way to fast then she spends minutes on enrichment
15001,Mark  McKibben,kibbles is the man he does make you do a lot of homework which is extremely taxing but is also really clear in lecture if you wake up each day at to listen to him talk you should be fine
15002,Mark  McKibben,calculus ii is hard the material but mark makes it easier to understand the information by drawing and showing proofs he is great at drawing graphs by the way his homework is always complex and makes you think really hard applying usually takes me atleast hours to complete his daily homework but great teacher
15003,Mark  McKibben,pretty cool and funny teacher hyper and silly even in class but the workload is quite a lot to handle also a very hard course with homework everyday about projects during the semester takehome tests which are hard the manual he sends out during the first week is not helpful at all he that helpful either.maybe just me
15004,Mark  McKibben,mckibben is the man though i think he is a little too smart sometimes i have trouble following his thought process which is lightning fast so us slower beings tend to get lost on the first try
15005,Mark  McKibben,nice man but the material was just too hard he was such a mathematical genius that he find a way to teach it to idiots like me who only took it for requirements recommend basic math for those who do math real good
15006,Mark  McKibben,mark is a great teacher he spells all the material out with crystal clarity and can answer any question that being said so brilliant that it was really hard for those of us that are only so good at calc to keep up and understand the material calc ii like a normal calc course it was intense i spent a lot of time prepping for exams
15007,Mark  McKibben,holy cow this class was insane but i recommend godel escher bach frontiers because an incredibly interesting class probably only because mr mckibben teaches it works really hard to help us understand everything great comments makes you want to do well in his class
15008,Mark  McKibben,what can i say great take any course teaching simply because he rules so much as a professor
15009,Mark  McKibben,very enthusiastic brilliant ask him about his nasa project someday sense of humor challenges you with the material but willing to talk it through
15010,Mark  McKibben,mark gets pretty excited over calc its funny he does a really good job of staying upbeat and energetic even when my class was dead tired and i was nursing a hangover the courseload is challenging but he helps you if you ask for it
15011,Mark  McKibben,mark is great his only real flaws are that he can be a bit too smart for his own good and his clothes are all too tight
15012,Mark  McKibben,great teacher absolutely one of the best teachers i have ever had he attempts to make things creative and challenging while also making sure we are learning
15013,Mark  McKibben,very effusive teaching clearly loves teaching upbeat very good at answering questions homework makes you think puts a lot of work into the course excellent at explaining concepts best math teacher ever had
15014,Mark  McKibben,mark is the best he loves challenging people but is always available to help he goes out of his way to make sure everybody does the very best possible and learns lots
15015,Anne L.  Dearing,worst professor ever i have never had anything below an a in english and i have a d i have never been so dissappointed in a professor in my life she is terrible and she is very mean and often comes off as rude she calls people out and she tears them apart shes like a vicious dragon she skipped class more than i did and were way behind
15016,Anne L.  Dearing,awful
15017,Anne L.  Dearing,get a new prof
15018,Anne L.  Dearing,hey i got a b shes not that bad
15019,Anne L.  Dearing,an honest yet sometimes hard hitting professor who excels at making you put effort into work at the things you need to accomplish for the class do not expect to go in for an easy a and do not expect there to be special treatment you do the work you earn your grade whether good or bad on you read mess around
15020,Anne L.  Dearing,prof dearing a bad teacher things to note about her class absences bring you down a letter grade being late by minutes times counts as an absence the final paper accepted late not even later that day she teaches grammar and essay structure if you want to read poems and analyze symbolism this the class for you
15021,Anne L.  Dearing,she takes off a final letter grade for every classes missed so skip too offen her quizzes are easy grade boosters and she teaches pretty straight to the book if bad at english you might struggle a little bit however a hardass and though her expectations are clear she grades tough i would take her again if i had to
15022,Anne L.  Dearing,this is the worst teacher at hvcc do not take her class she is not a good teacher at all she does not help she does not give any good advise drinks coffee and chocolate bars all class grades really tough my friend told me to drop her before school started and i should have listened absolute worst there
15023,Anne L.  Dearing,do not and i repeat do not take this class never in my adolescent life have i stressed so much about any academic subject but this course is absolutely abysmal the teacher tries to be funny but often comes off as very condescending there is very little passion in the class which makes it that much harder to sit through
15024,Anne L.  Dearing,nice but a tough grader you have to do all the work and keep up or you will fail
15025,Anne L.  Dearing,i have never had a professor who was more vague on what she wanted from us when it came to assignments the only student who got above a c was the girl who got dearing a fifty dollar giftcard to this teacher does not care about her students and her lectures never matched up to what we read in the text books avoid her at all costs
15026,Anne L.  Dearing,professor class is definitely not easy but she is without a doubt a great teacher you really have to work for a good grade and attendance is mandatory to pass overall she was very helpful though and wants success for her students i would not recommend this class if you like reading she also was very helpful with writing papers
15027,Anne L.  Dearing,very unpleasant instructor i immediately dropped her class after the third day of having to sit in her classroom miserable also the first thing she assigned was to write a biography about our personal lives and then present it orally in front of the class on the third day awkward expect reading due every class and numerous essays tests
15028,Anne L.  Dearing,makes you work but is very riveting at lecture
15029,Anne L.  Dearing,she was not there for the first two days of class and most of the majority of the semester but very strict with absences for students which i think is stupid and makes her a hypocrite very rude and egotistical a grader nazi so expect to get an a overall i recommend you take her and just leave her class now
15030,Anne L.  Dearing,grades really hard i do not recommend did not enjoy this class what so ever and felt really discouraged on one of my descriptive essays we had to do for class she wrote too much description sorry what awful
15031,Anne L.  Dearing,avoid her i stand her she thinks she is funny but she i wish she is dead
15032,Anne L.  Dearing,devote your life to her class work hard make many sacrifices and you will still not smell the paradise of an a only thing i liked about her class was before the research project
15033,Anne L.  Dearing,i withdrew from her class she is super tough and the class average can be between the c and d range at times a lot of writing is expected in and out of class and is super strict about grammar and mla format one mistake and you are done the class went down to about students from being full when i withdrew she tries to be funny
15034,Anne L.  Dearing,do it no run find another professor took comp online she never gives a grade higher than a b really i asked her she said very rare she gives an a unless its advanced college work go to the next professor
15035,Eric  Ericksen,i took his class for an easy a i have a background in finance as my family has been in different financial and investment fields for decades it was an easy class if you agree with him as a licsenced broker with years of experience i disagreed with some of the things he said it a boring class though
15036,Eric  Ericksen,funny guy never stopped laughing afternoon class never felt like it though really good class
15037,Eric  Ericksen,laughed the whole time make a late afternoon class seem so blah funny funny guy definately reccomend him can be a little disorganized but interfere with the learning
15038,Eric  Ericksen,he is all over the place and disorganized but very fun to be in class with as though he took in too many caffene pills before class
15039,Eric  Ericksen,useful for all majors little unorganized but easy and knowledgable
15040,Eric  Ericksen,everyone should take class makes it easy for none fin students
15041,Eric  Ericksen,favorite class and favorite prof most useful class ever taken funny
15042,Eric  Ericksen,wants everyone to do things his way unfortunately the wrong way
15043,Eric  Ericksen,i learned more useful stuff in this class than any other class great prof
15044,Eric  Ericksen,no comments
15045,Eric  Ericksen,entertaining disorganized presentation vague always late expectations unclea
15046,Eric  Ericksen,easy if keep up useful for life helpful if ask for it
15047,Eric  Ericksen,no comments
15048,Eric  Ericksen,very twofaced professor
15049,Eric  Ericksen,belittles his students class not worth taking
15050,Eric  Ericksen,bad class worse teacher
15051,Eric  Ericksen,no sympathy for students worthless teacher
15052,Eric  Ericksen,worthless class and teacher should pick another profession
15053,Eric  Ericksen,belittles his students appears nice but he care about his students
15054,Eric  Ericksen,energetic and fastpaced good if you can keep up good luck if you
15055,Nina-Nash  Robertson,i miss dr nina so much i am so honored to have sung under her
15056,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is the greatest choir director ever had she cares about input and does everything she can to get the best sound out of us possible in order to pass you have to show up but a given in choir and if you have too many absences she offers extra credit by attending festival choir amazing person and professor love her
15057,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is absolutely amazing got a great sense of humor is very easygoing and loves what she does so energetic what makes choir so great just be sure to show up to class and learn the music and golden
15058,Nina-Nash  Robertson,i am a recent graduate and nina was my saving grace at cmu she provided creative outlets through choir and challenged me to be the great musician that i became over my years as a vocal student i had several voice teachers but nina was the one that taught me the most about music and responsibility do yourself a favor and join her choirs
15059,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is my favorite professor in the school of music whoever says take this class is likely someone who is not that great of a singer but was pampered in high school you have to be the best singer to be in choir but you have to be willing to try and work hard i have never seen nina be rude towards a student and im a junior with h
15060,Nina-Nash  Robertson,not going to do choir again but i did enjoy the class great and if a music major love her
15061,Nina-Nash  Robertson,i love choir but after taking it with nina i will not be taking it again she sucks the fun out of the class i felt like i went backwards in my training she prefers young sounding voices and has obvious favorites she is incredibly rude to her students and thinks that what she says is the law do not take choir with her
15062,Nina-Nash  Robertson,ok not the most amazing conducting ive seen but i was spoiled at my previous college i dont think she spends enough time with concert and i think she does play faves sometimes but who doesnt i like her and am interested to see how my years at cmu play out
15063,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is the coolest person ever i loved taking her class and i loved the music we got to sing it was great
15064,Nina-Nash  Robertson,she has her favorites we do the same music all year long she talks badly about students quite often she is ok part of the time other times he is a completely horrible person
15065,Nina-Nash  Robertson,personally i think she puts to much time into other choirs and not concert choir choir was horrible because of this and not to mention we sang all the same songs the whole year
15066,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is a great choir director and an amazing woman
15067,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is a great person but the coir was just okay had better expereinces and singing the same songs all semester sucks but you gain some great friends and you get to sing so no complaining
15068,Nina-Nash  Robertson,taught me more about music than i ever thought i would get to learn very enthusiastic about her job and her students take choir classes with her
15069,Nina-Nash  Robertson,not even going to go there
15070,Nina-Nash  Robertson,the chorus was kind of a let down only because of previously amazing experiences let trying out keep you from any music classes at cmu very relaxed and friendly the class was fun and challenging attendance makes your grade or not not hard at of confusing direction at times
15071,Nina-Nash  Robertson,great prof
15072,Nina-Nash  Robertson,nina is a wonderful person and has a deep passion for music but i hated this class because we sang the same songs all semester also days a week and credit hour
15073,Nina-Nash  Robertson,it is inspiring for future music educators to observe choral teaching and conducting at best nina embodies what choral music is
15074,Nina-Nash  Robertson,best teacher and nicest woman ever she will do anything she can to help
15075,Christian  Schoof,he was alright some of the lectures all that clear and sometimes he seemed a little unenthusiastic but not bad
15076,Christian  Schoof,christian is like a wizard it takes him months to teach what the math department takes courses profs and months to teach poorly truly magical
15077,Christian  Schoof,super helpful and very clear in his lecture and in his email very nice proff and i would totally take another course with him again if i could
15078,Christian  Schoof,really good proof and very clear in his lecture assignments and exams are fair very nice and helpful
15079,Christian  Schoof,nicest prof really makes you think about the concepts reading online class notes will help a lot
15080,Christian  Schoof,a really good teacher
15081,Christian  Schoof,thinks hes better than he is
15082,Christian  Schoof,the best prof ever
15083,Christian  Schoof,christian is great take anything you can with him
15084,Christian  Schoof,christian is awesome the best prof that i have had here at ubc so far very helpful great class fun and interesting lectures he is very fair and like conventional teaching methods rather he will teach you why something is the way it is thanks christian loved your class
15085,Christian  Schoof,nice guy really easy his in class notes the greatest but his handouts are good
15086,Christian  Schoof,no comments
15087,Christian  Schoof,a very smart guy he knows well what teaching very open to questions clear notes
15088,Christian  Schoof,i think a first time instructor but really nice and tries hard to make us understand very willing to help and always looking for feedback on class
15089,Kristine  Fitch,kristine is one of the worst professors had incredibly full of herself and teaches her opinions like fact also technologically illiterate and wastes time trying to figure out the simplest things tests have confusing questions and she expects us to teach ourselves the material outside of class avoid
15090,Kristine  Fitch,she the worse but lecture is sometimes all over the place she is technologically challenged and she jumps back and forth through topics so it can be hard to take notes
15091,Kristine  Fitch,kristine is an alright professor she can be a little off sometimes and she forgets to put discussion questions up on icon a lot for exams need to focus more on examples rather than the actual definitions the exams super hard but i learned the hard way for the first half of the test the papers are short to pages hard
15092,Kristine  Fitch,kristine is extremely invested in what you take out of her class and i really enjoyed the class much more then i expected to considering i am not a communications major definitely take a class from her if you can
15093,Kristine  Fitch,fitch aka a lot of time and effort into teaching although the course material is abstract she explores both the simple and complex aspects creating depth of understanding her review chats online and discussion sections prepare students for the tests a great class if willing to study and come to lecture
15094,Kristine  Fitch,normally i hate my comm studies classes but kristine is funny understanding helpful and smart she truly cares about her students and the material she teaches i say her class is either easy or hard but she challenges you in a way that makes you want to do well i took her advanced topics in comm studies and a great class
15095,Kristine  Fitch,she was very nice and the class was extremely helpful in teaching me new and interesting things
15096,Kristine  Fitch,kristine is a nice lady who tries to make things fun plays a song before each class and relates it to lecture and goes the extra mile to help has open chats online right before tests posts lecture slides on icon you need to buy a clicker like she says you do
15097,Kristine  Fitch,not making clear or very logic point you feel like you know every word she says but it just make little sense not helpful in understanding the major need redesign
15098,Kristine  Fitch,wonderful at well planned lessons good organization interesting and compelling
15099,Kristine  Fitch,challenges but supports very smart and committed
15100,Kristine  Fitch,she is incredibly moody and unfriendly to some graduate students for whatever reason if you are not her favorite she will not smile when she sees you and if she is knowledgeable or an in your face feminist then she needs to be more friendly so that students will want to find out what she is all about i want to study with her
15101,Kristine  Fitch,fitch is quite knowledgable get on her good side and pay attention to details go to section write your papers very straight forward those are graded by your ta so suck up to them
15102,Kristine  Fitch,ugh she was odd her tests were hard the sections were easy but pointless assignments were very easy go class half the time and made a b
15103,Kristine  Fitch,kristine really knows what she is talking about in communication studies she does a good job at giving a brief overview of all the basic important topics in comm studies but also does a good job of making sure people understand them tests very hard and if you are able to take the honors section the best way to go
15104,Kristine  Fitch,its mostly commonsense and she even makes that boring unfortunatly you have to take this to get in the major but she sucks
15105,Kristine  Fitch,reeaal snippy
15106,Kristine  Fitch,yikes
15107,Kristine  Fitch,unhelpfull and just not interested in
15108,Kristine  Fitch,boring and confusing lectures and not friendly when you go to office hours unavailable to needs unless you are a chosen one that she likes
15109,David  McNevin,loved this class no nonsense approach to teaching conveys the critical information and explains its significance and application would take labour law again with him in heartbeat
15110,David  McNevin,he does an awesome job with a course that lends itself to being boring and hard to work with you might be able to learn more if you took this class with a judge but this guy definitely does a great job and relates concepts to reality very well
15111,David  McNevin,awesome one of the best had thus far made one really dry course one of the most interesting taken go to lecture and you need to read
15112,David  McNevin,always has a joke to tell but wants you to learn and understand what teaching you so a nice balance of work of play he explains things clearly and uses great examples to help you understand awesome professor
15113,David  McNevin,hilarious works magic with a very very dry subject also cute and gives away on occasion
15114,David  McNevin,so cute and oh so young
15115,David  McNevin,excellent prof very clear and thorough you need to do the readings
15116,David  McNevin,civil procedure is boring as hell but since you have to take it pick mcnevin funny and will make the material interesting
15117,Mimi  Fagan,never physically met her but she responed to emails promptly i enjoyed the class we used the test and the tests came right from that make sure to study for exams lots of memorization and cover a lot of material
15118,Mimi  Fagan,internet course never saw test grades portfolio or observ journal grades posted in eagle very vague syllabus and poor instructions for largest point assignments and offered little to no help in clarifying it very frustrated at the slowness or lack of answers to questions sent via email not recommended for an internet course
15119,Mimi  Fagan,she is a very nice and helpful teacher although this class is ridiculous the test are hard because it is all memorization and you know what will be on the tests i would like this class better if it so hard very relaxed class you get a lot of good input from this class with cool art projects class stunk but good outcome
15120,Mimi  Fagan,thank you
15121,Mimi  Fagan,i think the tests were hard as long as you study all the tests are essay but all you have to do is study your homework questions which can be a lot i liked it because i felt like i got my moneys worth you actually have to work for your grade i enjoyed it looking forward to my summer class with mimi
15122,Mimi  Fagan,tests are extremely hard because it is total memorization she is a great professor and very resourceful
15123,Mimi  Fagan,she has good teaching techniques but if you have problems memorizing information this is definatley not the class for you granted i am doing well in the class but its all from guessing pretty much alot of the material contains material from recent chapters the art activities are great though
15124,Mimi  Fagan,mimi fagan rocks a great teacher lots of fun and helpful
15125,Mimi  Fagan,allows students to work together on projects most class periods she takes this information and arranges tests tests are very difficult all memorization and listing list the ten steps to list
15126,Paul  Stevens,amazing professor his expertise within the subject matter is beyond this world he lectures only for hrs and the rest of the hour lecture he allows for group work his teaching method is nothing that you will expect but even though he relies on a lot of independent studying and research it pays off this method is very effective
15127,Paul  Stevens,avoid at all costs his lectures consist of him reading from essays he probably wrote years ago there is little to no direction for assignments there was no proper syllabus you are given three thick reading kits and left to decide what to read on your own this is a prof who retired ten years ago
15128,Paul  Stevens,he is a great professor willing to challenge conventional means of teaching and he is extremely brilliant granted he demands you know a bit more than you should coming into the class but it is a level course after all very lenient and enjoys teaching he constantly makes you realize that you are capable of my more great class overall
15129,Paul  Stevens,has to be one of the best can hist profs at york very easy going great lectures really intellegent knows his history in an out willing to help even outside of class follow university protocol which makes it even easier to work with him loved the class and great prof
15130,Paul  Stevens,a very intelligent man within his field of study not the best lecturer he seems somewhat out of touch with the modern university system he has an amusing tendency to glorify himself within his lectures
15131,Paul  Stevens,just brilliant
15132,Paul  Stevens,no comments
15133,Paul  Stevens,not only this professor stevens the best professor at york university but the most articulate and most calculated with his words will not bore you with social and cultural history
15134,Paul  Stevens,he is such a monotone speaker i felt like sleeping ever day in his class but his assignments and grading schemes are amazing you can ask him any question and he will help you until you feel comfortable with the material other than his boring way of lecturing he is a great professor one of the best i had
15135,Paul  Stevens,he is a great prof who knows what he is talking about the class will fly by
15136,Paul  Stevens,most insane teacher ever reminds me of john malkovitch complete with sleepinducing voice he came to class less than i did but is still the sweetest prof ever your entire grade is basically given at the end but lenient never again though
15137,Paul  Stevens,a great prof very approachable will always make time for you outside of class a very fair marker classes are relaxed
15138,Paul  Stevens,he sucks no guidance or structured lectures i only know of my mark so far and forgot always absent and give students prior notice
15139,Paul  Stevens,this man was terrible why is he teaching he knows lots sure but so boring and no direction to his students at all it was like he was trying to get us to fail
15140,Paul  Stevens,excellent teacher expects a lot from his students but is so inspirational
15141,Knofel  Staton,does knofel read these he was one of my professors at obc judy greer mcallister
15142,Knofel  Staton,no comments
15143,Knofel  Staton,no comments
15144,Knofel  Staton,amazing the only thing i like is the boring reading assignments
15145,Knofel  Staton,i just feel he is set in his ways and untouchable he is great when it comes to preaching and getting a class excitted and motived but when it comes to helping a student who may require extra time and slow the class down he gets frustrated he assumes that student doesnt take the class seriously or study he will offer to help but i would wonder if would expect the student to change to his stlye of learning not everyone learns the same auditory
15146,Knofel  Staton,i still remember when staton jumped on the table or picked on the girl in the front row as his girlfriend this guy is truly a great teacher funny lively the perfect class o wake u up
15147,Knofel  Staton,no comments
15148,Knofel  Staton,great prof amazing talent for teaching unreal enthusiasm and super easy grader
15149,Knofel  Staton,i have often referred to him as my hero he is like a cross between a fire ant and papa smurf
15150,Knofel  Staton,no comments
15151,Knofel  Staton,he makes the bible come alive if you have not had him as a teacher you are missing out on some great lovelism
15152,John  Burton,amazingly intelligent he lectures from memory and knows something about pretty much everything his course was truly fascinating only problem is that he made his exams years ago and change them to what he actually taught this year but in the end hes an easy grader and weighs the percents of each piece of your grade in your favor
15153,John  Burton,super interesting man super interesting class it was my first anthropology class and i learned so much he is really knowledgeable and has the coolest stories to tell there is only a midterm and a final so it isnt that hard of a class at all
15154,John  Burton,john burton is by far the best professor i have had at this college i plan to ask him to be my adviser and because of his teaching i have decided to major in anthropology he supplements his class with his own studies and so he is a master of the material if you want an easy class that will expand your mind give it a try
15155,John  Burton,very good storyteller chooses a wide variety of texts and is extremely animated making for a good lecture sometimes a little low on class discussions
15156,John  Burton,anthro do it just watch movies and probably learn nothing and then the class ends up being pretty hard
15157,John  Burton,amazing professor love his tight jeans and boots love his discussion of cows even more
15158,John  Burton,you dont really have to go to class but you should always get the notes because you will need them wacky grading system your whole grade is the midterm and the final nothing else ya stress
15159,John  Burton,an excellent class john burton is a phenomenal professor this class will open your eyes and change your perspective of the world around you
15160,John  Burton,no comments
15161,John  Burton,his classes are amazing i highly reccommend him difficult to get in touch with though sometimes keep to emails
15162,John  Burton,how did an intro class change my life
15163,John  Burton,great class
15164,John  Burton,prof burton is an amazing professor i loved every class i had with him especially language symbolism and theory in anthropology he is a great guy still helpful after graduation even though i switched careers and moved away from anthro
15165,John  Burton,an incredible professor and one of the most intellegent in the entire school
15166,John  Burton,john burton is a first rate professor and a superb anthropologist his language and symbolism class made me decide to major eloquent smart with a wry sense of humor highly recommend africa course too treats students as young anthropologists and never talks down recommend him enough
15167,John  Burton,my favorite teacher this semester stories are interesting and easy to follow very approachable and understanding so no worries about talking to him after class you respect him right off the bat for his knowledge and experience in the field class gets our early often
15168,John  Burton,can get boring as an early class but if you can bave the time than its def worth it surprisingly tough grader on the minimal amount of work assigned
15169,John  Burton,john burton is an amazing storyteller and a very funny guy he started off one of his lectures with the first time i had malaria i liked one day when he put away his notes and told stories the whole time dance major in college no less
15170,John  Burton,very intelligent and knows what talking about because done fieldwork in the past sort of intimidating but friendly if you talk to him one on one
15171,John  Burton,he was everything you would want a college professor to be extremely intelligent fascinating and a bit arogant all at the same time
15172,Kay  Leach,mrs leach runs the practical nursing program and teaches the harder classes sure she is hard on you but she expects a lot from you because nursing is a career where you must weed out those not cut out for the job as i am now working on my still fall back on things she taught me in class respect her not all care about you like she does
15173,Kay  Leach,kay leach is a great instructor i wish that more instructors are like is the best
15174,Kay  Leach,no comments
15175,Kay  Leach,very biased quickly picking her pets and discriminating against those students that she does not like
15176,James  Tompkins,dr tompkins teaches for understanding not memorization come to class participate and pay attention hi lecture videos are exactly what he taught in class so if you understand something watch it until you get it his quizzes are short but difficult i cannot stress enough how important coming to class and paying attention are
15177,James  Tompkins,genuinely difficult professor to navigate but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material which his quizzes and exams directly reflect do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly really tried and still made a yeah and he round up either
15178,James  Tompkins,great professor taking him in the summer is more difficult to manage tho would recommend him for regular semesters
15179,James  Tompkins,tompkins is a very good teacher who cares about you understanding not memorizing the material his youtube videos are extremely helpful but his tests and quizzes are extremely challenging and quite difficult he does not care about your grade and makes it nearly impossible to get an a in his class too much information to learn for a week clas
15180,James  Tompkins,if too lazy to go to class study this is not a course for you if you are willing to be challenged and god forbid learn something do fine as long as you work hard go to every class and start studying for exams way ahead of time you will be fine deep breaths relax
15181,James  Tompkins,this prof cares more about hearing himself talk than your education my peers busted their butts for and the b is with a curve on exams show him exactly the way he shows you if not you are wrong the biggest barrier to your success will be giving tompkins what he wants the way he wants it not learning the material
15182,James  Tompkins,he is not that hard if you just want to pass quizzes are of your grade but they are only few questions each he grades purely on the curve his teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you he has lectures on youtube which really help very light workload
15183,James  Tompkins,really great and caring teacher offers videos of all lectures so that you can study he wants you to understand the material and is always willing to meet for extra help prefers to call you on the phone to answer questions over emailing tough grader but completely fair
15184,James  Tompkins,good prof cares and gives you multiple opportunities to succeed always willing to answer questions outside of class my first class with him tests are hard but watch the videos go to class and pay attention because it helps you learn definitely would take him again not an easy class though
15185,James  Tompkins,very hard class does not use textbook wants you to learn to derive formulas you will not ever use tests impossible do not take this professor
15186,James  Tompkins,great professor and hilarious recommend taking him in the fall though taking him in the summer four days a week is tougher to manage
15187,James  Tompkins,tompkins is an amazing teacher he wants to ensure that you understand everything to the nth degree his class was one of the hardest classes i have ever taken that being said tompkins knows this and expects a lot but gives a lot of help he has his own youtube channel with his lectures to assist in studying study and practice a
15188,James  Tompkins,engaging his lectures are great i enjoyed his class and the way he teaches
15189,James  Tompkins,he is just a great professor and do not hesitate to take his course explains things well
15190,James  Tompkins,great professor smart sharp understanding always willing to answer questions i took two of his classes during the summer tests are hard study the lectures pay attention in class attendance not mandatory but he will give hints for the testsquizzes get a good group in i wish more were like him would take again
15191,James  Tompkins,i took him for fall class dr.tompkins is a talented professor with unique teaching style starting from our class he started providing audio powerpoint presentations which turned out to be very helpful tests are very challenging so pay attention to everything he says grade consists of a midterm final or group project and five quizzes
15192,James  Tompkins,i took this professor for a maymester and he was incredibly nice and made what could be a boring class interesting he is very discussion based so you have to be willing to participate grades easily on group project but tests can definitely be tricky and difficult if you prepare he really tries to help you understand the material though
15193,James  Tompkins,very good professor with an interesting teaching style tests are not that hard if you understand the material and pay attention to everything he says in class he will always answer any questions by making you answer it so be ready grade consists of a midterm final three quizzes and an optional group project take him if you enjoy finance
15194,James  Tompkins,this class covers corporate growth debt equity financing and dividends these topics are not taught in other courses there are five projects the math is not hard explaining the formulas can be difficult exceptional professor exceptional course
15195,James  Tompkins,if you want to learn take tompkins he covers more material and in greater detail than other professors he is challenging the projects are time consuming but are graded easily the quizzes are hard but are representative of the test do well on the midterm and set
15196,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,she is not a strong teacher i did not learn very much in her class she disrespects graduate students if you are looking into graduate school avoid applying to this professor
15197,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,get ready for a hand cramp lynn is a great prof cause she knows her stuff is clear and organized but she post notes on ur courses or web ct and will fly through the slides in class there was so much material in this class chapters on the final and all comprehensive expectations for a level class were a bit high
15198,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,alot of material and the final is culmative which really help the tests arent hard just too much to know and she explain the that well
15199,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,very thorough lots of much appreciated structure
15200,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,she explained things well but her tests were very hard there is a lot of material to cover in the class no matter who teaches it her final was comprehensive which made it very difficult considering the amount of information you learn in the calss
15201,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,her class is very interesting she has funny examples and encourages class participation she has a downtoearth approach not a proff that acts like she knows all the answers a breath of fresh air i would recommend her give any assignments just exams
15202,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,she is a very hard marker her tests are really hard be prepared to read the whole chapters of the text she finishes a chapter in days
15203,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,she is a hard marker but if you ask her what she wants you will see an improvement in your mark i would take another class from her there were no surprises
15204,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,too many notes i trippled the amount of my notes from any other level course tests are not overly hard but they are long and not enough time is given to complete them difficult marker she seems nice and knows a lot but needs more experience
15205,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,she is a great person very interested in what she does tries to make class exciting her exams are fair just figure out what she wants and your fine be prepared to have a sore hand lots and lots of notes goes through really really fast
15206,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,if you go to class her tests too bad for essays though watch out she is a tough marker we did cover lots of information in a short time but a lot of it was common sense so it that hard take another class from her
15207,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,lots of work lots of material to cover in a short time poor teaching style only uses powerpoint slides but possesses a great deal of knowledge tough exams and tough marker beware
15208,Lynn  Loutzenhiser,a bit to ditzy to be teaching at a university
15209,Chris  Hood,chriss hood is rad
15210,Chris  Hood,no comments
15211,Chris  Hood,funny and always makes time for his students outside of class
15212,Chris  Hood,best writing instructor i have ever had his conferences will help your writing skill improve drastically
15213,Gerald  Visgilio,talks very quietly and drones but what saying is easy to understand which is good for me since i suck at econ very patient and explains what he wants out of you so not hard to get good grades very nice to students so long as you are nice back
15214,Gerald  Visgilio,worst professor i have had at conn hard to pay attention to explain anything and expects us to understand right away problem sets are hard and graded hard do not take his class if you are interested in econ it is extremely frustrating
15215,Gerald  Visgilio,pay attention and take notes in class and you will do well no problem tests are problems discussed in class
15216,Gerald  Visgilio,lecturs are hard to get through at times but are very clear and tests are straight forward
15217,Gerald  Visgilio,hes my boy
15218,Gerald  Visgilio,fair grader goes into great detail on every subject take notes and tests will be no problem his personality can be tough to handle for long periods of time
15219,Gerald  Visgilio,professor v is a little boring and solely lectures the class and once in a while picks a person out to answer a question on the spot however he is very fair he always rounds up he definitely does not move too fast every class begins with a review of the last class
15220,Gerald  Visgilio,napoleon complex jerk should not be allowed to keep teaching most unfair grades in history prof with this many psych probs should have been retired long ago
15221,Gerald  Visgilio,amusing but i find it very difficult to feel engaged in the classroom he also does not take the time to learn names
15222,Gerald  Visgilio,he goes way too fast in class and is pretty unclear i think he has just been teaching for too long and has forgotten how to teach and that we all know everything already
15223,Gerald  Visgilio,as an ir major i was required to take econ classes of the that i took only one was even slightly educationalthat was intro to micro with visgilio he is a straight shooter and is totally reasonable and fair great guy and professor

15226,Jamie  Bush,a real good prof extremely helpful and friendly a fair grader sure enough the class was very helpful and the prof was even more helpful gives extensive comments on assignments he really wants people to learn in his class sometimes a bit monotonous but still manages to keep you interested girls watch out for his sly smile
15227,Jamie  Bush,great prof sparked interest in little narratives generally a fair evaluator straightforward tests very helpful agreed on the goodlooking part
15228,Jamie  Bush,good professor interesting material and insight drones a little at times but generally keeps the attention of the class allows for discussion which is helpful assignments and tests are graded fairly and prof bush is there to help however he can
15229,Jamie  Bush,his insight is intriging makes you think and draws you into a deeper understandings.you will gain so much out of this make you think diffrently about the diversity of pretty sexy this sly smile on his face so if you get a tad bored you can occupy your mind with him.really great guy in general
15230,Jamie  Bush,all i can say is an amazing professor gives thorough insight into the readings so you feel like they were pointless like in other courses a genuinely nice friendly and approachable guy always smiled when i handed in a test or essay to him
15231,Jamie  Bush,really great as a individual will say hi on the street and know your name some times very monotone but you wont be able to hold it against him cause you like him so much
15232,Jamie  Bush,no comments
15233,Jamie  Bush,an amazing prof he gives great insight into every work we studied which were all very interesting he is very involved with the course and does way more than any other prof at u of t definitely the most eloquent man ever met fabulous
15234,Jamie  Bush,a little monotonous but he knows his stuff
15235,Jamie  Bush,really intelligent and gives great insight into the material he tries to get the class involved which is great i love his extensive vocabulary and use of the english language
15236,Jamie  Bush,smart guy and a good teacher the only problem with his class is that his voice gets sort of droning which can lead to sleepiness the material he assigns is interesting and relevant and he explains it quite well up with the undershirts
15237,Jamie  Bush,no comments
15238,Murphy,no comments
15239,Murphy,murphy always talks about football and never mentions anything about biology he has confusing lectures but i will admit that his powerpoint short video presentations are ok his test are very hard and if you play football he will pass you reguardless so unless your an athlete i dont reccomend this class
15240,Murphy,this teacher is full of himself and his family he talks about his two sons all the time his quizzes and test are super tricky during lecture he goes offtopic all the time.bio is hard enough and he only makes it worse
15241,Murphy,never had a teacher pass out so many papers this is strange for a environmental guy in average lecture approximately of what is said is repeated insights that you hear is confusing assignments not nice at all
15242,Murphy,rambles a lot but does not give tests show up do the assignments and you can get an a
15243,Murphy,as long as you do your work you will pass he talks a lot and does not give tests bio you dont need to take notes at all just be on time and dont be absent he is very good about helping and explaining does contract class
15244,Murphy,a good guy be on time and do your work bio is a great class especially for those of us that are biology challenged it focuses on environmental issues if you make an effort murphy will help you pass with whatever grade you contrac
15245,Murphy,was not helpful at all spend all that money on the book and didnt even need it lectures where boring and not relavent to the hard test
15246,Murphy,no comments
15247,Murphy,he enjoys talking about his many degrees and about how great he is then why is he teaching at long beach city honestly come on now self absorbed low life
15248,Tony  Hage,wonderful professor truly cared that you learn and his efforts show it
15249,Tony  Hage,professor tony hage is an amazing instructor i strongly recommended him very passionate explains in detail making complex info easy to understand shwd short cut go above and beyond to help students plenty of reviews materials available before after class labs a final overall an excellent professor i would take him agai
15250,Tony  Hage,am really i took your class what a blessing he taught like an african teacher from ghana he will make u love chemistry oh my god he doesnt run from questions his in class lecture notes are the best am done with the class but i have his lectures still in memory i will take u again for pleasure just to be good with calculations dont miss him
15251,Tony  Hage,i will say that he is the best teacher i have evr had since i came to the united states he is very attentive and thorough with his teaching to add to it all he is very considerate.i think he is a real gem and he has made me a chemistry lover good job professor keep it up
15252,Tony  Hage,great professor he is very passionate about chemistry and will explain it as many times as you need so you understand it i would definitely take a course taught by him again if you listen and try then you can easily get an a
15253,Tony  Hage,haha did i say easy a he never runs from a question he encourages more questions he simplifies all the material his tests are written problem solving but get a question that discussed in class over times i know slow students who made it in his class so because he was willing to help
15254,Tony  Hage,fantastic teacher obviously passionate about the subject and passionate about teaching he is very good at making complex information easily digestible he has been teaching the course for decades and he has it down to a science no pun intended love to take another of his courses if i could bonus his personality is unique and fun
15255,Tony  Hage,hes brilliant he explains in detail makes it look easy its bviously chemistry no easy as u have to put in the work but he makes it look easy try not to skip class
15256,Tony  Hage,toni hage helps you understand chemistry he is there for you if you want to learn tests are not multiple choice so you must know your material all the material is covered in the lectures
15257,Tony  Hage,great teacher he is clear and he explains step by step he is the best teacher ever i love his class i hope he can teach my he covers the all book and i need to buy it mr tony the best teacher ever
15258,Tony  Hage,one of the best professors i have ever had
15259,Tony  Hage,professor hage is awesome take his class i drive minutes to get to class but i do not regret it his notes are very clear and his test are based on his notes if you study your notes before test you would pass his class with a good grade
15260,Tony  Hage,tony is an amazing teacher for those students who understand the hype it is because some of us just get chemistry but he makes us feel like it comes naturally i dropped another professor tacked on extra miles to be in his class would do it again i really hope he considers teaching organic chem take his class
15261,Tony  Hage,professor hage is an amazing instructor he not only has great analogies for learning chemistry but also gives plenty of review and instruction for his students hage made himself available prior toafter class for specific questions over lecture material i clear on class participation goes a long way with professor hage
15262,Tony  Hage,tony is a competent professor his lectures are understandable and he answers questions in a mostly clear manner however one thing that was annoying to me was how he bragged every other week about his amazing ratings on this website and the awards he got from the school because of them no offense but he certainly does not live up to the hype
15263,Tony  Hage,tony hage is handsdown one of the best teachers ever had if not the best i taken chemistry in probably years graduated hs a long time ago so the fact that i did so well is a testament to his teaching ability he breaks things down so they are easy to understand does tons of inclass practice overall an excellent person
15264,Tony  Hage,one of the best teachers i have ever had in my life.for anyone who struggles with chemistry take this teacher he is extremely clear in his teaching and goes above and beyond for his students he lectures in a way where his students can understand and encourages questions never met a person so kind
15265,Tony  Hage,very helpful teacher i will recommend this teacher to everyone who want to pass the class
15266,Tony  Hage,great professor my chemistry was good in high school but this professor made it even easier to understand for me with great explanation and examples he knows the chemistry really well u can almost ask any question and he knows the answer really great personality with a lot of knowledge
15267,Tony  Hage,just like all the rest of these reviews i concur he is the best teacher ever he makes chemistry fun if you ever get the chance to take his class do it you will appreciate chemistry for the rest of your life i took his class over years ago amazing professor
15268,Mary  Brown,mary is overall a good teacher you do not need the textbook just the lab manual we almost never had lab or lecture even though we are supposed to she gives out occasional extra credit ask questions if you have any because she is not the best at explaining things for the practicals i would recommend using quizlet to help you study
15269,Mary  Brown,mary is straight forward she only teaches the material necessary quizzes are from lab activities done in groups so attendance is important to get these points as long as you do the work and study you will do well she has a great sense of humor and i really liked her teaching style i feel i learned what i needed to
15270,Mary  Brown,this professor has a tendency to get off topic incredibly easy she is a very nice and funny person but scatter brained is saying it nicely be prepared to teach yourself a lot on your own time lecture heavy with little hands on learning
15271,Mary  Brown,dr brown is a great professor she does tend to get off topic often but funny and cares a lot about her students passing i wait to take another class with her
15272,Mary  Brown,very disorganized will waste your time for sure with odd musings and unrelated tangents makes it very clear how little she knows often behind on material uses the lab time to make up lecture time give the big picture so you will have to teach yourself the material on the upside the exams are pretty easy if you use study guide
15273,Mary  Brown,dr brown is a great professor anatomy is a very challenging course be she makes it enjoyable and understandable this was my second time around taking anatomy and with dr brown as a professor i passed with a b make sure to keep up with notes provided the greatest tool to passing this course is reviewing and using online lab tutorials
15274,Mary  Brown,she is funny energetic and really gets the students engaged in the class the notes seem hard to keep up with at first but basically an outline of the lecture shes giving and it goes in order you just have to follow along she cares about her students and wants them to succeed so if you go to her with quesitons she is always willing to help
15275,Mary  Brown,the best instructor i ever had she makes learning easy because she makes sure you know the most important things she focuses what you need know for real life and exam which makes grading easy i got a in her class of anatomy and you can also get that as long as you strive for it
15276,Mary  Brown,mrs brown is awesome she is the best biology teacher ever had she really wants you to succeed so she does all she can do to help you she is also very nice and though the lectures are boring she makes it fun this class is fairly difficult so make sure you miss days or you will be behind be on track with hw and study for your tests
15277,Mary  Brown,great professor actually enjoyed this class but no matter what teacher you have it is a stressful class lots of material to learn i recommend taking with or other classes too much
15278,Mary  Brown,the most amazing teacher ever have super funny and is always there to help takes the time to meet with you and explain stuff she is pretty straight forward on what she wants you to know
15279,Mary  Brown,she is very helpful during her office hours as well as class time tries to set you up for success
15280,Mary  Brown,dr brown is great extremely energetic she can be hard to keep up with but she really knows what doing i would definitely recommend her anatomy is pretty horrible so having a good instructor makes a big difference
15281,Mary  Brown,love her she very helpful and very animated during class to keep attention had her in anatomy now physiology anatomy was a little harder she gave extra credit on almost every exam she gives really good study guides in physio and tells you almost exactly what you need to know regret not taking her wish she taught every bio class
15282,Mary  Brown,a good teacher and she seems to know her stuff she does get side tracked quite a bit but she seems very passionate about her work and the students in general i only had her as a lab instructor but really awesome and she made it a point to teach everything she could in a timely manner willing to help out at any point just ask her
15283,Mary  Brown,love love love her she provides guided notes which make things a lot easier to follow and understand since there is so much material great sense of humor very compassionate and understanding with her students
15284,Mary  Brown,i had dr brown for bio and she rocks i took the class on a sunday and she made it fun and enjoyable she is always willing to answer questions and really challenges you i found her to be very fair and supportive of overall goal of being successful
15285,Mary  Brown,it was a pleasure taking the summer class with ms brown she challenged us to learn and identified areas of curriculum that was of importance it was good to know the teacher give us everything and allowed us to learn outside the classroom and encouraged open lab along with the apr online learning tool thank you ms brown enjoyed it
15286,Mary  Brown,very confusing to teach rushing and answer questions
15287,Mary  Brown,mrs.brown is a sweet person and is willing to help when you understand but her notes are horrible you basically have to take your own notes and really study outsid eof the class if you want to pass her tests are pretty fair and she always includes extra credit
15288,Edward  Wong,his lectures were very clear and often simplified the material for us his midterm exam was much easier compared to other sections all in all he was a good teacher in class and kept the class entertaining with his slides however on the downside he would sometimes seem annoyed or bothered to answer questions outside of class or at office hours
15289,Edward  Wong,amazing teacher i would definetly take him again lectures are easy to follow and never boring
15290,Edward  Wong,fina with him is considered a capstone fina course be solving cases and presenting throughout the semester extremely useful for finance students looking to apply what they have learned a very demanding course but be ready for the workforce thereafter he used to manage a multi billion hedge fund the best prof expe
15291,Edward  Wong,take class if you like group projects or presenting in front of class the group project very difficult but you will learn a lot as well his lectures are hilarious but the group presentations are often tedious very respected teacher and will listen to you his exams are very fair as well
15292,Edward  Wong,worst teacher i had in jmsb he teach you anything and care about his students you know how he grades you sent him emails to review my exams he never replied horrible teacher
15293,Edward  Wong,case analysis and final is a case workload is heavy after midterm all the cases are after the midterm find it hard to get anything above
15294,Edward  Wong,never had a professor with such vague instructions and unclear grading criteria teach anything on financial modeling supposed to learn it all by yourself if your goal is to learn modelling and valuation better off going to a seminar like wall street prep i only got as in my fina classes and this class ruined it
15295,Edward  Wong,taking this class was a negative experience the grading seemed very random with little feedback and no clear criteria instructions for the midterm were unclear help for the project was very vague with most of the valuation skills learned online no one failed the course but there were very few as and no one knows why they got their grade
15296,Edward  Wong,a great teacher and makes his lectures interesting but it his way of grading is completely random and unjustified he gave wrong instructions on what to focus on the midterm which resulted in a class average in the for the final we are supposed to value a stock without even having any complete financial statements
15297,Edward  Wong,avoid him fun to listen to and he knows his stuff but his grading is ridiculous i completely agree with the reviews below make friends with him or forget your a switching section for him was the worst move of my final year at jmsb
15298,Edward  Wong,one of the worst at jmsb finance avoid at all costs random grading criteria basically gives you a good grade if he knows you if you insist on taking a class with him focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get right from another review but my thoughts exactly wow
15299,Edward  Wong,one of the worst at jmsb finance avoid at all costs random grading criteria basically gives you a good grade if he knows you if you insist on taking a class with him focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get right
15300,Edward  Wong,he is very practical his class always involve real world cases and he is a easy marker i will definitely take another class with him
15301,Edward  Wong,one of the best in concordia he explains everything clearly and he is always there to help you will regret if you have never chosen him
15302,Edward  Wong,good professor his slides and explanation are very clear but he post them so you need to record them fast try your best to do the project
15303,Edward  Wong,prof wong is truly considerate for study progress and is willing help a student with good protaintials to achieve goals if you are a hardworker he is the one to choose to take
15304,Edward  Wong,one of the best professors in jmsb he teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word instead of boring textbook theory he knows that how important the gpa is when trying to find a job so he is never be a hard marker i learned a lot from presentations and while improving my presentation skills
15305,Edward  Wong,one of the best professor in jmsb he teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word instead of boring textbook theory he knows that how important the gpa is when trying to find a job so he is never be a hard marker i learned a lot from presentations and while improving my presentation skills
15306,Edward  Wong,this professor does not respect students regarding to his poor inclass sleepy behaviours and random marking criteria he will literally forbid a student from taking his class in front of the whole class rummer in school about him took over gifts from students who are pursuing taking his class it looks really bad if it is true
15307,Edward  Wong,he is a good teacher explain well but hard grader
15308,Julie  Ablarde,julie was great class was easy and she kept it interesting text was a waste of money though because she explains everything
15309,Julie  Ablarde,julia is absolutely wonderful person.she has the greatest big smile she reminds me of the actress gina davis she is so inspiring
15310,Julie  Ablarde,nice easy to approach
15311,Julie  Ablarde,great teacher she is very enthusiastic and passionate about anatomy which makes for a fun class even though the material is fairly complex
15312,Julie  Ablarde,great teacher also does not put up with class noise which is awesome
15313,Julie  Ablarde,julie is an amazing professor students know that if they need help in any area of thier julie is there to help she makes learning fun and her nerdy jokes always keep the class laughing or at least a smile with an eye roll she is passionate about what she teaches and relates with her students the best teacher loyalist
15314,Julie  Ablarde,ms ablarde is the most kindhearted hilarios and helpful teacher i have ever had she has made school very interesting and makes me want to go her refrences to the simpsons have made class more livly and fun ms ablarde helps her students even on her own time if they are having troble understanding the matirial i think she is awesome d
15315,Julie  Ablarde,julia is amazing brilliant a great teacher and beautiful how does she do it all
15316,Julie  Ablarde,crazy crazy and crazy
15317,Julie  Ablarde,julia is by far the best teacher ever had she makes learning fun you help but want to go to class i hope she continues touching lives with her wit intelligence humour i love you julie
15318,Julie  Ablarde,awesome teacher makes sure that everyone understands everything ands a humorous element to every class keep up the great work julia
15319,Julie  Ablarde,by using a mix of humour julie turned a terribly dry and boring subject into a fun and informing class she is the best professor i have ever had im just mad she doesnt teach year
15320,Julie  Ablarde,julia is the hottest teacher ever had that smile those eyes and
15321,Julie  Ablarde,julia rocks she is so much fun top talk to love the simpson quotes
15322,Julie  Ablarde,awesome teacher i luv her class
15323,Michael  MacKinnon,prob the best prof ever had i remember going into that class with no hope at all and little interest as it was my first lvl clss when i saw the reserve reading package i nearly dropped the course bec of its size but truly one of the few teachers that actually teaches you sth that u will never forget changes ur viewpoint on imp matters
15324,Michael  MacKinnon,easy to disagree with and argue ponits of disagreement
15325,Michael  MacKinnon,this man is a legend
15326,Michael  MacKinnon,awesome prof easy to get along with and easy to understand notes are hard to take in his class but if you listen and read do fine easy marker and keeps you up to date on current issues
15327,Michael  MacKinnon,i had no real complaints about mackinnon he was a really easy marker which was a definate plus and he was fairly easy to talk to be a great professor for someone just taking a politics course to fill their schedule very straight forward
15328,Michael  MacKinnon,very up to date on current events very interesting thoughts and ideas but i found that he spoke very fast but taking his class did make me feel more informed and helped take the step towards voting
15329,Michael  MacKinnon,yeah up to date on current events so he reads the newspaper this guy uses discussion of current events as a crutch because he doesnt know the real material very well course was way too easy a waste
15330,Michael  MacKinnon,no comments
15331,Michael  MacKinnon,by far the best teacher ever wicked class a must take you come out a changed person
15332,Michael  MacKinnon,very sharp and incisive though a tad intimidating very provocative lectures
15333,Michael  MacKinnon,very up to date with current events very current content great sense of humour highly recommend you man now dawg
15334,Sheng  Zhang,a smart guy but cant teach at all he does meaningless confusing proofs the whole class the two comments below are tripping if you do get stuck with him just watch professor leonard on youtube he teaches the same material i strictly watched his videos and took notes and finished the class with a solid a
15335,Sheng  Zhang,very smart guy and lenient with grading show up to class very often although i kept up with the homework and stayed on top of my stuff even though it might be hard to understand him at times definitely recommend him
15336,Sheng  Zhang,great professor very lenient grader
15337,Sheng  Zhang,i found dr zhang very helpful in such a tough class he takes a lot of care in explaining proofs and making sure that the material is well understood the class moves quickly so make sure you do the homework to keep up always willing to answer homework questions fail you unless you try at all
15338,Sheng  Zhang,it is pointless to go to class except for the weekly quizzes at the end of class just teach yourself from the textbook and work through problems his tests are easy because the questions come from the textbook the department final was also pretty easy but i would say this class is easy for those who can selfteach
15339,Sheng  Zhang,perfect teacher if you can teach yourself math so just come for quizzes to ask what will be on the quizzes which he will tell you his accent writing is rough take if dependent on teacher explanation very generous with points on tests attempts will get you far weekly quizzes midterms final
15340,Sheng  Zhang,the only reason i took this professor is because he grades on a straight scale is a is a etc his lectures are a bit confusing as he unnecessarily explains things and ends up making it make less sense i just used the book to teach myself most of the material and since an easy grader got an a in the class
15341,Sheng  Zhang,really tough class he is very hard to understand and his lectures are really confusing for some reason his example problems come out unnecessarily long and confusing tough time keeping up mostly studied on my own quizzes and tests are pretty hard although i question his grading because his answer key make sense caution when taking
15342,Sheng  Zhang,dr zhang does not have the greatest of english but the man is a master of math for his lectures if you can get past the wordage and minor broken english then they are a great source of info gives partial credit galore also gives credit for showing knowledge of material ran out of time showed i knew how to do it with indicators fx and got
15343,Sheng  Zhang,he was hard yeah but this is college differential equations is not supposed to be a walk through the park i went to every lecture and asked questions i would spend hours every day at the library studying for just this class but again this is college what did you expect put in the work and get an a
15344,Sheng  Zhang,the majority of the exam had content on it that was not covered very well i hope you understand math and word problems if you take him
15345,Sheng  Zhang,so patient with teachers and never thought id have to ever drop a class until i sat through one of this guys lectures couldnt understand anything and did all the practice problems for the quiz and it still made no sense i usually never complain but do not take this guy
15346,Sheng  Zhang,very nice and knowledgeable man doesnt have the best or most useful lectures but if you ask him a question he will answer it if you ask him a question on the he will definitely help you out if you do the assigned homework will be a breeze if you dont mind learning on your own go ahead and take him
15347,Sheng  Zhang,by far the worst teacher i have ever had he is probably one of the most brilliant at wayne state but does not know how to teach by any means he spends whole entire classes doing proofs and does not even teach on what we actually need to know for his impossible tests i will say he is helpful during his office hours i recommend him to no one
15348,Sheng  Zhang,sure he grades really easy but unless if you already taken a calculus class you will be lost every single lecture because he skips steps and explain what doing if you can study a lot and learn on your own then take him because of his easy grading people who say the best ever must already know calculus
15349,Sheng  Zhang,this is the best math professor i have had he is by far the easiest grader i have ever seen with that being said make sure you practice and do problems put in the effort and you will get an a
15350,Sheng  Zhang,hes the best study his quizzes and midterms for the final and thats it he bring the same problems
15351,Sheng  Zhang,very nice professor teaches the subject well by far one of the best professors had thus far
15352,Sheng  Zhang,good professor teaches the class very well very helpful makes calculus easy to understand even though it is a difficult subject
15353,Sheng  Zhang,he seems to know his stuff however he wastes way too much time trying to prove everything this caused our section to fall behind to catch up to the others for the final he had to cover the last chapter with very little depth a very easy grader and overall the class is extremely easy homework is optional
15354,Julie  Towell,very nice lady she rambles so you need to pay attention to the important stuff exams are not bad she gives study guides there are four exams no final and she gives extra credit at the end of the semester if you read you will do fine in her class she grades fairly and is willing to work with you
15355,Julie  Towell,extremely nice lady five exams and one paper good class but way too much material she needs to lessen the amount but get more in depth lectures are interesting but really fit tests tests seem more like a memory exercise she takes attendance so miss more than three classes i got an a
15356,Julie  Towell,shes the worst english teacher i have ever hsd
15357,Julie  Towell,not very helpful to students at all questions in the study guide do not help and you spend so much time trying to memorize what you have read for the tests that you have much time to learn other things
15358,Julie  Towell,well prety much the content of the was was not important and was not part of a real english class we had to read poems and then have a quiz on the poems and not english content it self i wish i had droped this class the first day i steped foot into it
15359,Julie  Towell,i had her for and guess what guys peace o cake alot of these reviews seem baseless essays tests thats all are you kidin me yea we had to read a book but it wasnt that bad disregard is that spelled wrong the other ratings she is good
15360,Julie  Towell,no comments
15361,Julie  Towell,she is the nicest person ever if you have to talk to her about anything but she does get lost in her lectures sometimes i would take her again for another class because she bad the tests were straight forward and the papers were very reasonable she is real strict on attendance and takes it everyday twice a day
15362,Julie  Towell,she is the nicest person that anyone would ever meet in this world the work is easy all you have to do is read poems and write responses for them you get a couple of major papers but all that matters is the grammar and not so much the content but if you are completely off subject in everything you write your grade might suffer
15363,Julie  Towell,this teacher is an attendance nazi after missed class or late arrival or early departure you start losing points off the final grade she is horrible at lecturing and seem like she has much knowledge of the material she skims the surface take someone else
15364,Julie  Towell,if you take notes safe tests are very straightforwardno trick questions.rather dry and the time goes by worth it for an a.quizzes are a joke and the papers bad either
15365,Julie  Towell,i quit school cause of her its professors like her who give english literature a bad name
15366,Julie  Towell,gave too much homework and work in general overloaded with class work and unfathomed time window to finish a book grading critiques were not fair and to get anywhere you have to suck up not my kind of learning experience
15367,Julie  Towell,a course surveying years is not going to be easy but she knows her stuff take lecture notes what tests are based on and read going to classes everyday is not unheard of this class does require effort but you will be rewarded
15368,Julie  Towell,this teacher is very very hard there are weekly quizzes in there all of the essays are based from reading materials no free topic very critical on grading essays no joke
15369,Julie  Towell,horrible teacher very tough on grading and assigns way too much work must show up everday and are overloaded with work also not avaible to discuss papers
15370,Julie  Towell,makes you think but the essays were awesome to read very helpful you need to attend class but will do well if you put in the effort
15371,Julie  Towell,awful simply awful
15372,Julie  Towell,makes english harder than it has to be gives in class assignments everyday which are so dumb talks a lot and is very very critical on your writing
15373,Julie  Towell,great teacher there may be a lot of reading but she never asks tricky questions and the final exam is the exact same questions you can even read notes and still get an a
15374,Brian  Lakey,no comments
15375,Brian  Lakey,this class is is supper hard i would not reccommend it unless it is required
15376,Brian  Lakey,do not take this class this was the worst class i have ever taken i showed up to class everyday and taped everything he said i also did all the reading and i still failed i was a student before i took this class out of students failed the
15377,Brian  Lakey,horrible teacher his tests were unneccessarily hard and his classes were so boring that you never want to go he really should stop teaching
15378,Brian  Lakey,besides the fact that he mumbles constantly and gives hard tests the class too bad the lab boosts your grade and he grades tests on a curve lectures were somewhat interesting but a lot of people failed then again there was quite a few stupid questions asked by the students during lectures so you blame it all on him
15379,Brian  Lakey,the class is very easy if you actually go to all of the lectures and pay attention his tests were not hard at all plus he was very easy going and listened to any concerns you had
15380,Brian  Lakey,the advisors are investigating him nice guy but ridiculously hard class.never missed a all of the reading and still failed i had close to a before i took his class the tests were definitely not anything that was covered in the book or lecture
15381,Brian  Lakey,is the worst professor ever at wsu he should be fire
15382,Brian  Lakey,i dont like the way he teaches and he is the most borning professor i have ever had
15383,Brian  Lakey,he is difficult and tends to have high expectations for students but is not unfair he curves his exams and listens to student input he also is a very dynamic lecturer with just an amazing amount of knowledge if you want to learn about psychology take a class from him
15384,Brian  Lakey,one of pych told me that wayne suspended him once for failing more than half the class harder than hell this is a phd psych level class not a beginning psych level class beyond difficult and gives very few and take him unless you want a d or f
15385,Brian  Lakey,i believe this guy taught intro if you get a average on all tests you automatically get an regardless of your lab grade i went to every lecture except and come exam time everything was foreign not recommended lab was great but lecture destroyed many had to retake
15386,Brian  Lakey,if you can appreciate genius in action take a class with this professor he is tough but with good reason pay attention and you might learn something besides that smile of his makes it easy to forgive him for being a hard grader
15387,Brian  Lakey,he is a very hard teacher the lab is easy but the exams are very hard just about immposible to get a good grade in lecture at the begining of class even says that more then half of the class will get a c or lower and eventually drop
15388,Brian  Lakey,an excellent teacher you learn alot but have to earn everything recomend him if you truly want to learn about psychology
15389,Brian  Lakey,not at all helpful or clear about what he wants out of students worst professor i have had at this school
15390,Brian  Lakey,tests unreasonably difficultpractically impossible to get an a never missed class but almost never knew what he was talking about either get out while still spite of this sublimely charming and keeps your attention riveted
15391,Brian  Lakey,brilliant and sexy a combination that usually is orthogonal
15392,Brian  Lakey,tests are extremely hard he trys to make lectures interesting and he somewhat succeeds definitely would not reccommend him because its hard to get a decent grade unless u want to study your life away
15393,Brian  Lakey,nice person but very odd knows what he is about but he is probably the only one i am not too sure if dr thoughts generalize to thoughts
15394,Jon  Sabo,learned the most from jon out of any teacher at bethel
15395,Jon  Sabo,jon is one of the best people i have ever met his passion for theatre and his extreme knowledge and skill in theatre is very evident any class you take with him has a profound impact on you but the times just working with him that you learn most
15396,Jon  Sabo,no comments
15397,Jacoba  Koene,excellent teacher very good at explaining concepts clearly and gives coursework that is relevant and helps improve your skills i feel i improved my spanish a great deal in this class
15398,Jacoba  Koene,hard class but pretty helpful if you ask for help class could be boring at times interesting at others very nice prof and has led a pretty interesting life
15399,Jacoba  Koene,is very qualified but sometimes lets classes drag
15400,Jacoba  Koene,great lady but class is hard
15401,Jacoba  Koene,proessor koene has lost all touch with what it is like to be a college student the class contains a ridiculously obscene amount of work for a few measly credits this class has made me hate the spanish language no exaggeration
15402,Jacoba  Koene,dr koene is awesome her class is very interesting and there are many opportunities to work on conversation skills she is kind and fair and has a lot of experience she is a spanish guru
15403,Jacoba  Koene,koene is great hard enough to make you think and work but she give you busywork that make sense to do she also likes to help students and is very patient plus had such an interesting life
15404,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,he is the best professor in entire uhcl i have seen most of the professors in uhcl but none like him character wise and as a teacher very soft person dosent get angry at all he knows the subject very well and has great knowledge in it most on them take advantage of his lineance and dont listen to class hes a great personality
15405,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,late to the start of class of time often runs class late as much as minutes of class time is reading powerpoint slides very little insight compared to reading the textbook assignments are poorly structured
15406,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,the most unorganized teacher i have ever had his tests are ridiculously long reads from slide to slide just like all teachers at uhcl my recommendations to someone who wants to learn net read a book basically the same thing but without a massive test do not take this course if you want an a
15407,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,great professor very helpful and cares a great deal about his students very knowledgable professor probably the smartest man i know he is kind of soft spoken but he knows what he is talking about and is willing to help
15408,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,sometimes class duration was too long and unnecessary allowed late submissions for assignments slow or no response to email otherwise he was patient and straightforward assignments were vague and students would submit their own interpretation instead of using a template for consistency
15409,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,he is one of the most boring instructors ever had he just reads the slides and you have to sit for hours and listen you have to study on your own he help much
15410,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,tests are short essay tough programming and simply long programs are very challenging and often take full time to complete still learning a lot about net etc but fairly decent in covering the topic he will look things up if he know class sessions are mm kay sleepy
15411,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,he has a take it easy california style teaching ways his programs are hard but doable you might have hard time hearing him in the class suggestion sit in the front seat for exams practise the exercises at the end of each chapter his assignments are done in grp of choose a good partner
15412,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,no comments
15413,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,do not know how to teach
15414,Alfredo  Perez-Davila,he gives very tough homework assignment on programming programming in internet protocol class yes his teaching is bad he just go over the text book builted powerpoint and read what the slide say i do not recommend taking his class so beware
15415,Timothy  Fox,wouldnt take this class ever again
15416,Timothy  Fox,i hated the class but professor fox was really helpful he was incredibly nice and super patient he was a joy but glad the class is over
15417,Timothy  Fox,professor fox is an outstanding teacher he really cares and makes a somewhat difficult subject easy and a lot of fun i looked forward to going to class every day i went out of my way to take another class with him next semester
15418,Timothy  Fox,prof fox is an amazing teacher even if students are not interested prof fox motivates them he is fun in class and lvoes joking around with students very reasonable and clear expectations for class and tests he is an absolutely wonderful teacher
15419,Timothy  Fox,prof fox is by far the best spanish teacher i have ever had he works hard to make us talk in class and engage us in the lesson he is update to date with technology and uses it well he really wants us to learn and remember forever rather than just learn to pass the test a very good teacher
15420,Timothy  Fox,one of the nicest persons ever had the privilege of meeting readings for class were somewhat hard but we went slow and he helped a lot too much translating though very helpful prof and very understanding not a lot of homework just reading and one major paper and presentation some parts of tests were a bit hard though
15421,Timothy  Fox,amazing guy class is fairly easy and he is extremely nice and knowledgeable take him at every chance you have
15422,Timothy  Fox,fox was very funny and definitel one of the best teachers i have ever had
15423,Timothy  Fox,my only complaint i wish speak more in spanish only during class
15424,Timothy  Fox,i wish he was as accurate with figuring grades as he is with language thanks
15425,Timothy  Fox,prof fox is interesting challenging helpful understanding and intelligent i wish i could have taken more courses from him
15426,Timothy  Fox,professor fox is very kind and very intelligent he is interested in his students and his class is stimulating
15427,Timothy  Fox,no comments
15428,Timothy  Fox,fox is my advisor so i get to know him more than a lot of other students he is supernice and helpful a little scatterbrained with meetings but that is easily forgiveable i suggest him because he makes the class so easy because fun
15429,Myrna  Simpson,very helpful and engaged the students explains topics clearly and is easy to understand
15430,Myrna  Simpson,i hate this woman too arrogant for her own good and yes id liketo see her academic career go down one day i just think dry and boring and makes a class that involves soil a blah course
15431,Myrna  Simpson,shes the sexiest teacher that i have ever seen good teacher and fair marker
15432,Myrna  Simpson,she good at keeping your attention also helpful
15433,Liwen  Shih,awesome professor gives you time always there for you helps you pursue your interest respects hard work
15434,Liwen  Shih,great to deal with makes the class enjoyable though you do have to earn your grade but not like the hardest there
15435,Liwen  Shih,great professor
15436,Liwen  Shih,she is the excellent instructor if you really want to learn.all of classes teaching are foreland of computer science and image she can hand all these very tough classes so enough to prove she can catch the step of development of computer science and engineering.strongly recommend her class
15437,Liwen  Shih,seem to put the time into this class should stop bringing her kids to school can you say babysitter
15438,Liwen  Shih,shes not good at subject
15439,Liwen  Shih,her class is very good her teaching is good she just go over the students understanding and convenience i would recommend her class
15440,Robert  Gay,made people almost cry in class because of how he went about criticizing papers he just wanted students to write papers he thought was correct rather than write from their own opinions he needs to learn how to criticize constructively instead of blasting people for trying their best good intentions but really bad
15441,Robert  Gay,the epitome of pedagogy if you believe your teacher should not impart their own views in class and their purpose is to get you to think for yourself then this sociologist is for you
15442,Robert  Gay,such a great guy and a great professor learned so much and so interesting and fun
15443,Robert  Gay,i love him he is so interesting and funny very laid back so if not what you need from a professor take him
15444,Robert  Gay,his accent is pretty nice good teacher easy class
15445,Robert  Gay,as baller as they come laid back but always willing to help out the lost and confused teaches a v lucid methods class that moves along at a crisp pace infusing practicaltype material with nicely coherent conceptual binding also has a dope accent you will not be able to imitate trust me class subheading how to save the world using surveys
15446,Robert  Gay,professor gay is my favorite professor so far at conn

15467,Gary  Bruce,one of the most welltaught classes taken it a but his lectures are so interesting you are guaranteed a good mark if you show up and pay attention
15468,Gary  Bruce,pretty much the greatest teacher had so far at waterloo hilarious and makes you wanted to attend class definitely take as many courses with him as you can you regret it
15469,Gary  Bruce,favourite prof so far makes the class amazing i am a health student but he actually made me think of taking more history classes
15470,Gary  Bruce,he was probably my favourite prof at waterloo
15471,Gary  Bruce,amazing he is a profound teacher who makes you think is very funny and gives you goosbumps when you hear his stories his passion shows through his lectures he is the reason i want to persue a career in the study of holocaust history
15472,Gary  Bruce,dr bruce is the greatest prof i have ever had it is because of him that i am still pursuing history he is always available outside of class and he makes the students want to go to lecture i never missed a class just because so interesting and entertaining
15473,Gary  Bruce,fabulous professor he will do anything to ensure you understand whats going on he has an amazing sense of humor yet is passionate about what he does i suggest taking as many courses with him as you can
15474,Gary  Bruce,prof bruce was the best professor ive ever had his avid interest in what he teaches is translated into how he teaches his interest is contagious after every class i wanted to go out and read more on what he taught this man is a genious funny and cares about his students i looked forward to this class every day and hated when it ended
15475,Gary  Bruce,excellent history prof i highly recommend his courses
15476,Gary  Bruce,wow there to say about gary that been said he really is all that and more best professor had in years not to mention one of the only classes that i looked forward to attending and wished it over when the lecture ended so great
15477,Gary  Bruce,awesome prof his class is interesting he is genuinely interested in what teaching he makes the subject matter easier to take in given the nature of the class overall one of my fav profs everr
15478,Gary  Bruce,gary is an amazing prof i have never looked forward to going to any class as much as i do for he rush through info and repeats info crucial plus he makes time for his students and is always willing to help he is a tough marker but a great guy all around and soo funny you must take this class amazing
15479,Vida  Praitis,professor praitis is helpful but she really takes off a lot of marks on attendance she curves not in a good way if she wants only three a in class she gives your final paper and poster bs without telling you any reason so that your overall grade can fall from a to a or on her class be careful on your every homework and quizzes
15480,Vida  Praitis,loved professor class she manages to explain a lot of pretty difficult concepts in easytounderstand terms lab independent projects are a lot of fun and always more than willing to help you with anything lab or classrelated quizzes require you to show your knowledge rather than vomit up a bunch of stuff memorized
15481,Vida  Praitis,best professor ever happen to me d she is nice and give respectful feedback on every piece of homework you submit she taught wonderful genetics and she knows what she is talking about during class she is also super helpful on projects definitely recommend her to anyone
15482,Vida  Praitis,an okay prof somehow simultaneously very reasonable and hopelessly out of touch with students push back a deadline but then not be clear what she wants from the assignment help if you ask for it but is also harder than other profs in that she assigns more work
15483,Vida  Praitis,she is very engaging and caring professor she has profound knowledge about c.elegans and embryo development i would recommend taking her bio intro class
15484,Vida  Praitis,really awesome teacher excellent class nice model system basically everything ever want in a bio classin one bio class now my advisor so the bias is just what it says on the label
15485,Vida  Praitis,this class was an amazing experience for me my bio background was beyond the intro level however the deep paper discussions were informative and her perspective as a geneticist refreshing her grading can be demanding but always fair she engages students with the material and i even got to work on a project directly related to her research
15486,Vida  Praitis,wow i learned more than i thought i would paper discussions were the best i have ever had at grinnell labs however suckeda lot this was not fault though yeast have a habit of not always working in regards to vida teaching it is important to realize that all of the bio professors teach right out of the book
15487,Vida  Praitis,vida was an amazing professor to have for a tutorial although she was quite demanding she was very helpful and interesting and usually very clear in her asignments and grading
15488,Vida  Praitis,her lectures are based off the supplied powerpoints verbatim classes are very very boring tests often lose sight of the fundamentals she is very enthusiastic outside of class and her labs are fun i really recommend her as a prof
15489,Vida  Praitis,i had vida for one class her first year of teaching and i remember what it was but i remember that although the class was hard i really liked her and thought she was very accomodating to needs
15490,Vida  Praitis,i dunno what this first guy is saying she was the first proff to actually make me love bio if you are interested in genetics then hesitate if you get her style then a piece of cake participate even if you know
15491,Vida  Praitis,a very kind caring professor but her intro bio class was pretty boring overly focused and teach anything new
15492,Vida  Praitis,vida is so nice that hard not to like her however her lectures can be unclear and her assignments are not spaced very well throughout the semester but very approachable and always willing to help
15493,Andrea  Austin,what a nice person she is very approachable and her lecture material is clear i would definately recommend any class with her
15494,Andrea  Austin,very good teacher the best i had willing to go the extra mile subjects were well thought out and organized it seemed like she enjoyed what she did and cared about studies and the empowerment of many types of women
15495,Andrea  Austin,probably the best prof i had all year d
15496,Andrea  Austin,super nice lady willing to help you out the course itself is alright some of it the thoery part early on particularly is quite boring but i thought she did a pretty good job of mixing things up in terms of assigned readings and videos
15497,Andrea  Austin,excellent
15498,Norman  Spivey,dr spivey really cares about his students he has talked to me many times in his office about personal life stuff and class stuff he is very smart in his field of study his examples he uses in class fit perfectly with the material we cover
15499,Norman  Spivey,that man knows how to do two things teach psychology and wear a beard great professor
15500,Norman  Spivey,interesting and knowledgable was an amazing teacher for social psych but is quite lazy in his methods for personality theory prefers to make us sit in small groups most the time and teach ourselves i dont pay for classmates opinions or to teach myself the book he should be held accountable for this i want my money back
15501,Norman  Spivey,the man he knows more about psychology then i know about my face way to go norm
15502,Norman  Spivey,he can be kinda tough but he really knows his stuff so glad i had him as a professor he is definitely one of the best psyc profs out there
15503,Norman  Spivey,dr spivey is a very good teacher not always the easiest teacher but knows what he is talking about and truly interested in helping students excel
15504,Kelly  Mailly,hot and awesome
15505,Kelly  Mailly,unpleasant she took her bad days out on us maybe its a bad relationship or she is just an unhappy person check with the department for what staff means just in case you get stuck with her
15506,Kelly  Mailly,no comments
15507,Kelly  Mailly,very helpful and available to answer questions seems like she cares a lot about us and likes what she teaches
15508,Chris  Dobson,professor dobson is very knowledgable in this subject and makes the class lectures interesting there is a reflection question after every class but easy and good for review anyway a few other point assignments that will help to boost your grade because the exams are tough you out of class early often
15509,Chris  Dobson,he is so funny and so kind his class is so much fun even if science interest you his lectures are never boring and as long as you come to class and pay attention the exams are really easy great guy
15510,Chris  Dobson,one of the most knowledgeable and helpful professors i have had at grand valley i would recommend taking any class that he teaches
15511,Chris  Dobson,one of my favorite professors so far dobson does a great job engaging students and seems to get everyone excited to learn science has never been my favorite subject but this has so far been my favorite class i have ever taken even for an class i never wanted to skip because there was so much material covered and class was very interesting
15512,Chris  Dobson,great professor bio really my thing but his sense of humor and stories he would tell related to class topics made class more interesting really cares about students and definitely wants to make sure we all succeed have picked a better professor
15513,Chris  Dobson,i wish prof dobson taught because he would be my first choice he is an amazing professor who knows what he is talking about all of class is lecture but it is engaging and easy to follow along sometimes he talks super fast but if you ask him to repeat something he will do it right away and make sure you understand i highly recommend him
15514,Chris  Dobson,dobson is super nice and he wants everyone to succeed if you go to class worry puts lectures on blackboard and easy to follow always got out of class early and he stays after class if you have questions
15515,Chris  Dobson,this teacher is great just a tough class
15516,Chris  Dobson,i was scared of this class beforehand because not really a science person however i truly enjoyed this class even at because prof dobson makes the content interesting and cares if you do well he lectures most of class but if you print off the power points it is relatively easy to follow along i would take him again if i could
15517,Chris  Dobson,one of the greatest professors had the pleasure of getting to learn from very tough material but thats biology for yah he did an incredible job at explaining methods
15518,Chris  Dobson,by far the best teacher i have ever had
15519,Chris  Dobson,wants all students to do well but makes it damn near impossible does not give any extra credit and does not curve any exams which is annoying when all other professors curve their grades hard tests but if you read his powerpoints verbatim then you should be fine study for the quizzes because those are easy points and do well in lab
15520,Chris  Dobson,alot of people have given dobson a bad name but i honestly think that he does a really great job at actually teaching the course its a lot of material and he expects you to know it so its on you to study your ass off but he explains everything so its easier to understand and is more than willing to answer any questions lectures are essential
15521,Chris  Dobson,dobson is a great professor he is funny engaging and honestly teaches a lot to his students in the amount of time he has that being said he is incredibly difficult compared to the other professors that teach this class if you are looking for a good professor who will teach you material look no further if you want an easy a keep searching
15522,Chris  Dobson,professor dobson is a great professor if you are looking to not learn and what an easy pass he is not the guy to take you will definitely need to read and study a lot outside of class he give outline and base his test off of those he is very helpful and wants his students to pass i would recommend taking him if you want to truly learn biology
15523,Chris  Dobson,dobson is a great professor and you can really tell he wants you to do great in his class and genuinely cares about his job he is very helpful during lecture but you definitely need to read and study a lot outside of class to pass the tests
15524,Chris  Dobson,he is super helpful since its bio you know its going to be hard but he makes sure you know what he expects of you he tells you exactly what to study and how to get an a
15525,Chris  Dobson,professor dobson was a very nice teacher who made lectures interesting he was always cracking a joke during lecture the tests are very hard and if you study a lot you pass if looking to put the time in i would definitely recommend him
15526,Chris  Dobson,tells you exactly what you need to know and all information is in his power point lectures even if you understand the book helps a lot it can be tough but as long as you pay attention and study you will do well
15527,Chris  Dobson,makes you work for your grade but tells you exactly how to get the grade you want study the powerpoints back and forth until you know them like the back of your hand and you will be good for the exams
15528,Stuart  Vyse,prof vyse has done a great job sparking my interest in psychology he does a great job keeping the class engaged with his helpful powerpoint slides succinct explanations of main ideas and integration of outoftextbook materials he will make you work hard but you will learn a lot in addition he is very kind and has a good sense of humor
15529,Stuart  Vyse,at times he can a bit too silly and forget that actually trying to prepare you for his tests
15530,Stuart  Vyse,he was a funny excellent professor he made the material interesting
15531,Stuart  Vyse,great professor probably one of my favorite professors at conn he presents his material in a clear and concise manner while also trying to add a little humor to it had him for two classes and wait to take more with him
15532,Stuart  Vyse,i love professor vyse he is adorable and funny and makes class interesting i definitely recommend him for any psych class i had his for and and he is just an amazing teacher
15533,Stuart  Vyse,really liked his class
15534,Stuart  Vyse,instead of v for vyse i accidentally clicked on b for boring no lie i suggest learning to sleep with your eyes open nice but scatterbrained and his classes i took and particularly hard
15535,Stuart  Vyse,he is amazing one of the best classes ever
15536,Stuart  Vyse,good professor i had him for both psych and psych stats he uses slides for everything so if you miss class you can just print out the slides and learn from that also if you print out the slides before class like the night before then you get to write down the other things he says more easily and that helps a lot highly recommend
15537,Stuart  Vyse,amazing really clear funny
15538,Stuart  Vyse,very helpful very informative very funny even in advanced stats and very cute
15539,Stuart  Vyse,professor vyse is awesome he makes the material interesting at the level course and incorporates a great sense of humor he seems very reasonable in his grading but mostly just a really intelligent funny professor
15540,Stuart  Vyse,he is a great teacher irrational behavior is interesting to begin with but he makes it even more enjoyable he tells jokes all the time very easy to talk to gives you more time when needed on assignments i think he grades very fairly you do the work you get the grade you deserve
15541,Stuart  Vyse,hilarious makes each class hysterical also a really nice guy
15542,Stuart  Vyse,for the class size he does a really good job interesting material he plays music before each class and has a sense of humor which makes the lectures even better
15543,Stuart  Vyse,i love the class
15544,Stuart  Vyse,i love prof vyse he is my academic advisor really funny and that always helps in a science class idk what to say about him take his class and find out
15545,Stuart  Vyse,i loved this course he makes the material so interesting and is really nice
15546,Stuart  Vyse,funny guy interesting so far
15547,Stuart  Vyse,he may have high expectations for the boring intro classes compared to some other teachers but hes actually a really interesting funny great guy if you get to know him in upper level clases
15548,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,good in teaching approachable tough course
15549,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,probably one of tbe best teachers at mcgill but his tests are very hard be prepared to put a lot of time in this course make sure you understand the material well do as many previous midterms and finals as you can this class is for sure the hardest one taken at mcgill
15550,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,an excellent prof teaches really well explains everything clearly and is very helpful if you go during his office hours however his exams are very tricky so you might want to get your concepts clear solve his past exams make sure you really understand the solutions and you should be good
15551,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,he is very nice prof clear precise and explains very well answer your questions seriously exams are bit hard but within the material he covers he is very responsible and respect students well best prof at mcgill
15552,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,
15553,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,his knowledge and wisdom fascinates me he was always smiling when talking to people no engineering background but he approved my taking his course and so patiently explained every basic things about engineering to me i wish i could take one more of his course but no longer at mcgill i miss him and his marcov chains
15554,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,one of the best electrical teacher you can find
15555,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,i took him for signals i must say he is the best prof explains the stuff really well this final was hard but the marking was lieneant take him for any course i love his greek accent
15556,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,easily one of the best teachers ever had very clear helpful and knows his stuff nice guy
15557,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,prof psaromiligkos is perhaps the most clear and precise professor that i have ever taken a class with he is also extremely dedicated hardworking and is always willing to clarify any doubts that a student may have his class notes are very well organized he is also very friendly and has a nice sense of humor indeed the best prof at mcgill
15558,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,he is a great prof down to earth when ure with him u never feel like talking to authority you feel like talking to a friend whom you respect and who cares about what you say
15559,Ioannis  Psaromiligkos,a good prof who understands why students understand
15560,Paul  Bush,bush is the type of guy who only wants to hear what he wants to hear he like when people correct him and he assigns many assignments multiple due on the same day sometimes forgets they were even due also his favorite thing is calling on every single person in the class and putting them on the spot with questions
15561,Paul  Bush,this was probably the worst experience i have ever had if you are a female forget it if you correct him when he is wrong forget it he thinks he can grade you at the end of the semester by just what he thinks my a was brought down to an a because of it
15562,Paul  Bush,incredibly hard at first but becomes the most useful class anyone in the field could take the way he prepares his students for post grad life is ten times better than most of his colleagues in the fitzwater center not a bad thing to say about him and do not take anything personally
15563,Paul  Bush,best teacher ever i have had him all four years and he has taught me a lot i have a great deal of respect for this man and i hope people will have the same experience i have had
15564,Paul  Bush,he is a really good journalism professor he will pick on you but usually its because you do your work overall be prepared to do a lot of work but you will actually learn something
15565,Paul  Bush,pretty good prof
15566,Paul  Bush,awesome professor pushes you to strive for the best those who like him much have never really taken the time to get to know him or they are probably failing his class because they do their work or read had him for all four years and my advisor i have nothing but good things to say about him
15567,Paul  Bush,the man rules the beard says it all the only bush haters are the ones who belong in community college and handle an actual class where you have to be prepared and know
15568,Paul  Bush,horribly boring professor he spends the whole class trying to find someone who isnt paying attention or doesnt know an answer so he can humiliate them also he is very discourteous and continues to lecture minutes after the class should have ended the only way to get the guy to stop talking is to physically start packing up your books
15569,Paul  Bush,professor bush is the man he makes class so much interesting by putting pressure on people to speak up
15570,Paul  Bush,worst teacher i have had in my life
15571,Paul  Bush,senior seminar is over the top as far as assignments go total chaos overall though a good professor and very reasonable when it comes to grading if met the requirements and demonstrated that done the work do fine also a good advisor if a journalism student
15572,Paul  Bush,good class a bit boring if had journalism in high school prof bush is decenta fair grader in j1 at least i wish he the only journalism prof though he can be funny and sarcastic at times he stressed professionalism to the max so no computer games during class and be fine
15573,Paul  Bush,bush is cool but can get kinda boring at times overall good guy
15574,Paul  Bush,def knows what talking about only complaint is that he repeats himself a lot
15575,Paul  Bush,even he doesnt know what talking about
15576,Paul  Bush,how can you not love a prof who will call shoddy work barfy or my personal favorite barfarific he knows his stuff and if you follow his advice learn a lot
15577,Paul  Bush,funny guy he sort of says that whole ehh not quite thing alot but if you pay attention you will learn a lot from him he is a fair grader too
15578,Paul  Bush,no comments
15579,Paul  Bush,good guy knows his stuff
15580,Udeme  Ndon,very unorganized late to class every day i learned more from the ta in my lab notes are hard to decipher and contain mistakes lectures are a waste of time
15581,Udeme  Ndon,this class is easy but professor is horrible at explaining and a lazy unfair grader he is even worse when you try to contact him for any issue whether it be class related or advising related his jokes are not funny at all grab the handout and leave the class fortunately for you the handout does a better job of explaining than he does
15582,Udeme  Ndon,his knowledge of the subject is extensive dr never tried to implement dialogue in the class setting in semester he was between minutes late to every lecture without exception which in a min class leaves no time other than straight lecture furthermore his ta for labs english language skills was not sufficient
15583,Udeme  Ndon,dr ndon is an excellent teacher his concern and natural interest for this subject is displayed by his teaching methods i took this class the first time they offered it and i would recommend it to anyone else that is interested engineering for the environment his tests and grading is extrememely fair i would definetly recommend it
15584,Udeme  Ndon,hes the most unorganized and laziest teacher inthe civil engineering department to put it short and sweet an idiot
15585,Udeme  Ndon,his a good teacher but like to give of so expect an a even if you get on all you midterms and hw and lab because the final is very hard and because of that most of the grades drop
15586,Udeme  Ndon,notes and lectures are very clear the homework is long but clear and understandable there are no surprises on the exams
15587,Udeme  Ndon,dr ndon is very clear in his lectures he makes the material seem easy and the exams are relevant to what is taught in lecture i would definitely recommend him to anyone that might need to take this class
15588,Udeme  Ndon,dr ndon is a very good man who is concerned for his students at most times he is very openminded towards the students and their requirements he is also a very openminded person in terms of testing being that he is very smart he sometimes gives exams that are he makes up for it later
15589,Udeme  Ndon,great course for understanding the complex process of hazardous waste managment and treatment process the handouts were very clear and dr ndon was always available for help outside the class
15590,Udeme  Ndon,the lectures in this class were very clear and understandable there were plenty of examples given in class the class was conducted in such a way that one did not even need to consult the book that much dr ndon was very nice and helpful
15591,Udeme  Ndon,after having just taken the eit exam i can say that ce was very helpful the class was conducted very wellthe lectures were clear and understandable dr ndon was always accessible and willing to help overall i enjoyed the class very much
15592,Udeme  Ndon,he is wellprepared his notes are very clear and understandable the fact that he is wellnatured helps also i highly recommend him
15593,Udeme  Ndon,he is a well prepared professor and gives us the experimences that are related to the course his homework assignment can help us to undterstand the class materials dr ndon is available in all his office hour
15594,Udeme  Ndon,his lecture is understandable
15595,Udeme  Ndon,although he presents himslef as generally good natured dr ndon is an ineffective teacher he is lazy and advance his understanding
15596,Udeme  Ndon,he sucks you learn nothing about engineering
15597,Udeme  Ndon,he reads out of the book.thts the lecture.dont even bother going to class.go ask him sumthing about the projects tell u to check with lab instructor and the lab instructor just sends u back to him do not take him with siambis.youwill screwurselfover
15598,Werner  Kriegelstein,dr krieglstein is one of the most shameless selfpromoters ever encountered all required texts were authored by him only one about ethics pgs did film analysis based on the or ethical theories actually covered final entailed giving our opinion of his novel did we like it and why got and feel that i learned nothing
15599,Werner  Kriegelstein,this guy is too deep for any sort of character based review he care about your submit the work on time and get an a seriously like a hype man for his own material all of the course material is authored by him and he even comes equipped with his own wikipedia page you learn much other than his resume
15600,Werner  Kriegelstein,easy teacher the movies you have to watch that bad and papers are super easy to get on easy grader as long as you seem like you kinda understand impossible to fail this class
15601,Werner  Kriegelstein,took the online class very time consuming not to mention you must buy of his textbooks which cod even carry i got an a because i sucked up in the papers i wrote you have to write an word essay a week his book compassion is very difficult to understand really struggled through the whole thing reccomend him for online
15602,Werner  Kriegelstein,the online course was very time consuming watch movies read his book and write a paper each week the material is interesting i feel like i did learn quite a bit but would have learned more in a classroom setting syllabus is clear you know what is expected from the start
15603,Werner  Kriegelstein,i really enjoyed introduction to philosophy with werner he is very intelligent and has a lot of wisdom to share i would recommend taking his class to everyone
15604,Werner  Kriegelstein,he mostly taught of whats wrong with plato and aristotelean views and why his philosophies are right.very ignorant to abrahamic religions made me believe that he has never really read a bible or quran because he was off in his facts.but if you want to know his views hes great.i had him his last semester so he must have already checked out upstairs
15605,Werner  Kriegelstein,i liked this class a lot i thought that using movies to write papers on the subject matter was an interesting idea he used some audio cds in this class that were really good made us think about things we otherwise would not have
15606,Werner  Kriegelstein,boring easy a
15607,Werner  Kriegelstein,i took this class through the internet papers midterm and a final you watch movies and then write your papers based off them and what you read in your books it is a no brainer he gave me an a and i never even finished reading his book compassion if you need an easy credit take this class it was a lot of work but a fair grader
15608,Werner  Kriegelstein,if you want an easy a take his class you do very little work he curves his tests like so impossible for u to fail you just have to show up to class kind of strange but i got used to him
15609,Werner  Kriegelstein,currently taking the class online great professor his book compassion is very insightful easy grader in the sense that he values ur opinion and is very open to new arguements leaves constructive feedback on all papers reading the book not difficult watch movies do the papers and do great
15610,Werner  Kriegelstein,loved him in this class he made the philosophy class what its supposed to be wish i could have him as a teacher again sadly i already have ethics done he uses his own books that he wrote for text books so if you have any questions about the reading he knows exactly wht it means
15611,Werner  Kriegelstein,he was very friendly and nice sometimes he was hard to understand i had trouble during his class and missed a lot of class i got cs on most my tests but since i got an a on the final and participated i got an a in the class hes very easy going
15612,Werner  Kriegelstein,ethics he is a cool dude because he have a set agenda to class he assign but has a couple tests which are rather easy if you fill out your work book the material covered in class is important but what he grades more on is your opinions and your pretty cool dude if you ask me
15613,Werner  Kriegelstein,ethics is a good class to take if you need an easy humanities credit i thought my papers sucked but i guess in ethics your opinion could be right so he gives you the a my midterm i thought i bombed but because i rebuttled some of the questions i got the a too what a good teacher
15614,Werner  Kriegelstein,dr krieglstein is a great prof he grades based on your true desire to learn and the effort you put into understanding the material he assigns a paper based on topics found in one of his books and assigns journal entries based on reading material and movies in class deep and profound class that may change how you live your life
15615,Werner  Kriegelstein,reading philosophy used to be tedious before i took this class dr kreiglstein has a wonderful teaching style and a tremendous breath of knowledge all the books he mentioned in class were great reads the classes always seemed too short and i was always waiting for class next week i would recommend this class as required learning for everyone
15616,Werner  Kriegelstein,a very wise man
15617,Werner  Kriegelstein,i am taking this class over the internet there are papers a midterm and a final as long as you answer all the questions for your paper you will get an a
15618,Phyllis  Goodman,professor goodman has not changed since these reviews started in obnoxious amount of work taking this class online in conjunction with another class with a fulltime job and a family is not recommended
15619,Phyllis  Goodman,let me preface saying i got a in the class but it was the hardest i have worked in any class in a long time especially online to get a good grade summarize the book if you are willing to put in the time you can do well but taking it in conjunction with other classes is an ill advised move
15620,Phyllis  Goodman,a business major and even though i got an a in this introductory internetbased business course i did not have much fun sure it was nice doing work on my own time and learning about business as a whole but there was little emotion or passion from prof goodman when we did have to meet in class it seemed pointless but the class was easy
15621,Phyllis  Goodman,took her online managemnet class spring it was the most work had in an online class but she grades very fair and if you do the work you should at the very least get a b i got a pretty easy a and actually learned a lot take this class over the summer or when you have a lighter workload great class
15622,Phyllis  Goodman,she does assign a lot of work but she is very fair if you do the work and this why called college and you make an effort do well she is very responsive and helpful i would take her again
15623,Phyllis  Goodman,i took her online principles of management class and wrote a lot of papers basically do what she asks by outlining the book and make sure to touch upon every point and get an a gives out extra credit points for adding comments on discussion board and is a lenient enough grader write the same paper and get an a
15624,Phyllis  Goodman,i took an online course with her and she does give a lot of work but if you do the work you should get most of the credit the assignments can be long and overwhelming but like i said if you do the work you will get an a the assignments can be done very loosely just writ to fill up space to her its quantity over quality you can get an a easy
15625,Phyllis  Goodman,i took her class two years ago through online biggest mistake i ever made in college she is horrible and gives too much work i sometime thought she was an english teacher while getting back the assignments i dropped out because of the overwhelming work load at her course if you are taking more than two classes make sure you have her
15626,Phyllis  Goodman,way too much homework offer any extra credit very picky strict internet course timeline
15627,Phyllis  Goodman,great teacher her online course was to the point and she graded very fairly this was my first online course i have ever taken and i got an a i enjoyed having her as a teacher
15628,Phyllis  Goodman,too much damn work
15629,Phyllis  Goodman,the most unhappiest women i have ever seen she does not know to smile
15630,Phyllis  Goodman,this lady just care wants to be hard core spoiling the classroom ambiance
15631,Phyllis  Goodman,no comments
15632,Phyllis  Goodman,taking her business simulation class and the homework was a fullload of pile we had in the group and now only left and both of us have to do all homework designed for people and she lack us off taking her class is challenging
15633,Phyllis  Goodman,she is not very friendly phyllis seems to be unhappy all the time but i was never sure what the problem was i would never take another course with this lady
15634,John  Tudor,really smart guy done this for a long time and it shows all of his lectures are very clear and he explains everything perfectly he gets really excited when we answer his questions and ask really intriguing questions awesome guy really helpful outside of class helps you find new ways to study efficiently sweet man who cares if you care
15635,John  Tudor,best first year biology teacher really knows his stuff and knows the perfect way to explain everything so that you understand it very good at pacing himself also very helpful if you show concern
15636,John  Tudor,honestly who you have for bio lecture really matter but tudor however tudor is a great instructor always willing to help students very old school
15637,John  Tudor,excellent professor and human being his level of knowledge is amazing and can deliver it through his teaching warning he expects a lot and is not as easy grader
15638,John  Tudor,hes an awesome professor i had him as an advisor too he is very descriptive in his teaching and is very helpful hes very accomodating when it comes to extra help you can tell he really loves teaching biology i would really recommend taking him his class is tough and so are his but its manageable
15639,John  Tudor,great teacher he is very clear in class and really knows his stuff he is a little intimidating because he does expect a lot from his students but his high expectations keep his students working hard worth the effort this class requires
15640,John  Tudor,great teacher not only is he adorable with an adorable accent but he goes in depth and he helps out and as long as you take notes and pay attention you are fine make sure to study your stuff and if you read the slides you are fine for quizzes text and slides for test
15641,John  Tudor,incredibly awesome guy very helpful but his expectations for a nonscience major are unfair not one person in class was a business major and he expected hours per week at least for studying outside the classroom and that we study it everyday i would not take this class again given the chance plus it had a lab and lab project
15642,John  Tudor,extremely helpful intelligent and nice professor makes himself readily available almost any time during business hours if he have a class or meeting the problem is that very difficult and his expectations are unrealistic especially for nonscience majors if a bio major recommend him otherwise say no
15643,John  Tudor,listen to the bad reviews tudor really is the best teacher for he is a very nice guy and very approachable which many of the bio professors at sju the and everything else are run by the bio dept not the individual teachers so they are the same in all the sections the best of them by far
15644,John  Tudor,good professor bio is tough but he was pretty fair about it also had online review sessions before the test which were helpful
15645,John  Tudor,memorize the slides and got it made
15646,John  Tudor,if you take the time to learn klingon you can get an easy a
15647,John  Tudor,extremely difficult but doable be prepared to study at least a couple of hours everyother night to stay on top of the subject between lecture and lab do about hours of work a week just in bio do this and you might be ok take bio only if you are seriously into it
15648,John  Tudor,horrible one of the hardest teachers ever had no matter how much i studied i never passed his tests i even had a tutor nothing seemed to work
15649,John  Tudor,this man is amazing a little difficult to follow sometimes but very helpful very understanding awesome
15650,John  Tudor,awesome teacher took him both semesters knows his stuff likes the material bio is work but i would take him again in a heartbeat always posts his lectures really wants you to learn love bio as much as he does highly reccomended
15651,John  Tudor,very helpful easy to go to for help
15652,John  Tudor,tudor is a nice man if you need help go to him for help he appreciates that effort gives online help sessions before every exam not hot
15653,John  Tudor,an excellent teacher always willing to help lecture is very interesting be prepared to work hard he is hott
15654,Arthur  Droge,i really loved this professor he looked at the controversial and man from all points of views he brought the science into the religion by discussing the themes of social vs actual ailments he was amazing a great lecturer very hot and unpretentious very dramatic and moving kept you intriuged with what he would do next and i agree that he take any crap from knowitalls or arrogant skeptics the essays were really hard but it challenged your thinking
15655,Arthur  Droge,one of the best professors had at ucsd he is thoughtful and intriguing although i think what he says goes straight over the heads of most which is the fault of the closed minded student populace not him
15656,Arthur  Droge,my favorite professor so far he may have changed my attitude towards life if a christian he might convert you to something else
15657,Arthur  Droge,droge was great he really knows his stuff and makes you think for yourself the classes are challenging and entertaining
15658,Arthur  Droge,excellent professor
15659,Arthur  Droge,i liked him he was an inspiring professor
15660,Arthur  Droge,i believe all these people like him were we in the same class droge totally had a point to everything he said a lot of fun very entertaining hecka weird sorta offensive take it personally really appreciated him a quarter lat
15661,Arthur  Droge,not a good teacher at all you do get the essay questions before the test but they are very vague his lectures are so boring i concentrate take him his class is ridiulous he likes to hear his own voice and really ugly and old
15662,Arthur  Droge,he has a wonderful way of presenting himself and i think that he fulfills his duties as a professor he does an amazing job keeping the class interested at least with my class and i mind the view from front row
15663,Arthur  Droge,boring and a joke his lectures suck and are hard to take anything away from them
15664,Arthur  Droge,his lectures are either really intriguing or extremely boring he find that medium or balance and he almost seems biased most of the time be careful about taking him but he does his job
15665,Arthur  Droge,worst teahcer had so far he rambles on forever and no one has a clue what he is talking about very confusing lectures and is very difficult to take notes on waste your time trying to stay awake in his class
15666,Arthur  Droge,very enthusiastic and engaging and hot
15667,Arthur  Droge,note how all the good ratings are based on sex or passionate ew ew ew
15668,Arthur  Droge,droge is passionate and very intelligent overall a cool guy
15669,Arthur  Droge,the guy just likes to hear himself talk teach or lecture just rambles
15670,Arthur  Droge,sexy and an amazing lecturer taken all of his classes
15671,Arthur  Droge,although a good lecturer extrememly biased and unfair on essays
15672,Arthur  Droge,hot hot hot sexy smart and gorgeous take anything he teaches
15673,Julie  Benavides,i have taken several online classes1 of the most fantastic classes i have taken cd major but we learned so much in such short time the lectures videos were great shout out to prof benavides for being so organized contacting us see how we are doing caring about us motivating pushing us we learned about ourselves family life
15674,Julie  Benavides,i learned so much from taking this class and i really enjoyed it she gives ppt lectures and provides links to articles and videos to help with the lecture she truly cares about her success just do the reading take notes keep up with the discussions and wou will do well in the tests
15675,Julie  Benavides,i learned so much in this class at first it was overwhelmingly but she gives you linked learning to videos and her lecture notes with examples i found it fascinating that i not only understood about the developing child and adolescence but about myself i loved the inspirational messages and reminders that she included in her announcements
15676,Julie  Benavides,as awesome as everybody says she truly cares for her students and goes above and beyond to further assist in learning the material she sends reminders listens to her students needs and always motivates her students as long as you do your part do great must take her class if looking into taking a child development class
15677,Julie  Benavides,the information i have learned is unbelievable i take classes and get tested and forget the information but mrs b relates the theory to actual teaching practices and i understand the picture
15678,Julie  Benavides,a great instructor and really goes out of her way to help the students out i took her years ago and could still call her for any help that i may need in the field of child development of course we created a portfolio in class which has been with me since and has help me greatly to obtain a have been impressed thanks julie
15679,Julie  Benavides,so much stiumlating info on teaching a better teacher because of her she goes the extra mile but expects a lot from you
15680,Julie  Benavides,fun educational caring hands on goes the extra mile
15681,Julie  Benavides,ms benavides is very clear and easy to understand she makes the class fun to be in she genuenly cares about her student and what they are learning take her if you get the chance go ms b
15682,Julie  Benavides,great child development instructor will go out of her way to help any student
15683,Ida  Slusher,the things that i could say about this woman i could go on for days probably a great nurse in the field but absolutely neurotic in class reads straight from slides classes are a foray into nightmarish levels of boredom tests are a mess of questions pulled from thin air and you are always guilty of cheating until proven innocent seriously
15684,Ida  Slusher,you can tell that she definitely knows what she is talking about but lecture is ridiculously long and boring she goes off on random tangents and many lectures she only goes over or slides because she is so long winded tests are hard but they prepare you for nclex i thought the paper was the toughest as she is an apa format freak
15685,Ida  Slusher,test day is a nightmare she is very concerned with making sure it is done correct which is fine but she can come across as very rude about it she touched my arm and lifted my sleeve to look for a watch the tests that bad honestly the paper was more difficult for me she is very specific about apa format so be careful with that
15686,Ida  Slusher,ida seems like a great nurse get me wrong however her class sucks her tests are ridiculously hard and her lectures are extremely boring she reads straight off the powerpoint so i not even shown up for class but had to the exams are all definitions of basically the same words i hate that this class is a prenursing class
15687,Ida  Slusher,these prenursing classes were the reason i decided nursing was not for me your grade is dependent almost entirely on exams and a final the tests are ridiculous with definitions and random questions over apa format and god knows what she walks around and stands over you while you test she is the only option but i would not recommend
15688,Ida  Slusher,you can tell from class that dr slusher is definitely a good nurse and knows the information she is teaching however she is very tough to please in class her tests are the hardest out of the prenursing classes all the answers can be right but you have to pick the one that is the most right you definitely have to work for your grade
15689,Ida  Slusher,ida you can tell she is an amazing nurse and an even better woman you can tell outside of class she is very nice but in class is different during exams she puts tissues in your face takes your jacket and once made me move my arm because i guess i could be cheating the class is hard dont get me wrong but it is definitely doable study
15690,Ida  Slusher,dr slusher deserves a lot more credit than most people give her she is someone i look up to for her accomplishments in nursing she is a professor that cares about the future of nursing and wants you to succeed slusher will prepare you for the rest of your nursing program and career lecture heavy funny intelligent has high expectations
15691,Ida  Slusher,as this professor was the only professor teaching the course i had no option but to take her class she seems to mean well and sure she is well respected in the nursing world but it was impossible to meet with her one on one and she failed to email me back a few times be prepared to study and pay attention in class or you will not pass
15692,Ida  Slusher,where do i even start terrible you have tests and all hard considering the fact that she gives you correct answers and you have to choose the most correct answer make sure you understand apa front and back because she tears apart your paper for literally everything no point of going to class she reads off the pp
15693,Ida  Slusher,dr slusher accept a hand written love letter from channing tatum if it apa format she is crazy for the rules and reads the powerpoint word by word everyday good luck dealing with her voice tests are common sense but difficult because there are right answers but you need to pick the one
15694,Ida  Slusher,better study because there are tests and one paper it the whole class lectures are pointless she reads off the powerpoint which btw are bright blue in lime green writing hard to read and i only went for attendance
15695,Ida  Slusher,having class along with the other two prenursing courses were a major wake up call for me i was used to making and ended up making in all three of the courses the tests are confusing you basically have to choose the answer want you to she grades the paper really strictly so make sure you take it to the lrc beforehand
15696,Ida  Slusher,not very helpful ask her a specific question and you may or may not get an answer tough grader she can also be rude at least she likes what she does
15697,Ida  Slusher,before i say anything else i liked ida as a human ida is the nurse that administered zyklon b to the jews but only if the apa formatting was correct ida is the definition of a bureaucrat she wastes of semester covering formatting pon paper is about format tests are mostly powerpoint
15698,Ida  Slusher,great teacher
15699,Ida  Slusher,dr slusher is everything you want in your nursing professortremendous depth of knowledge clarity in delivering the material great examples from her personal experience humor ability to make neither content nor the grading will leave you questioning her teaching and she brings candy
15700,Ida  Slusher,knows her stuff but i did not enjoy having her as my professor she is rude i could have made a better grade if i had known how to study the questions in the back of the fundamentals of nursing book were helpful but you do best by studying the powerpoints test was mainly over the syllabus be sure to study
15701,Ida  Slusher,dr slusher is passionate about her work and nursing as a profession i have personally enjoyed learning a about h e r experiences she provides examples pertinent to content she is teaching and encourages class participation enhancing optimal learning she sets high expectations for student success and accountability which i admire and applaud
15702,Ida  Slusher,dr slusher is one of the rudest professors i have ever had she is the exact reason why i am changing my major this semester she grades the semester paper extremely difficult she treats her students like they do not matter the exams are rough she will tell you something will be on the exam and it wont be
15703,Paul  Clark,his class was a lot of work a reading and a writing assignment for every class the great part is the class is over before you know it he is a fair but not easy grader a very compassionate person and it will help your grade if you agree with those sentiments
15704,Paul  Clark,nicest man ive ever met in my life all of his papers for religion in literature were about ourselves it helped you figure out who you were as a person and it was a very helpful course to take during my freshman year of college i have nothing but great things to say about him and his class
15705,Paul  Clark,a very good and passionate teacher he really cares about the material and is very helpful and compassionate toward students nicest guy in the world
15706,Paul  Clark,so great
15707,Paul  Clark,knows his subject very well really cares about writing literature very fair with grades
15708,Paul  Clark,nonviolent warrior was a great class i especially liked his lectures on gandhi mlk jr and leo tolstoy this is a good way to get the ids requirement out of the way
15709,Paul  Clark,cool class i had lots of fun just talking about myself and talking about works i liked the silent movie i believe gonna be chaplain now
15710,Paul  Clark,awesome prof learned so much about me and my writing through his teaching creative writing is such an awesome class
15711,Paul  Clark,much learning from him
15712,Paul  Clark,avoid his class if possible
15713,Paul  Clark,creative writting was the easiest and best class i have ever taken at albright
15714,Paul  Clark,non violent warior is so boring
15715,Paul  Clark,no comments
15716,Bradley  McLean,prof definitely knows his greek but seemed bored while teaching it at this introductory level like he always would prefer to be elsewhere very gracious in allowing retests but could benefit from a bit more time spent upfront in assuring students are onboard
15717,Bradley  McLean,he knows a lot about the new testament i mean he seems like a really smart guy
15718,Nam  Soon Song,so sweet and approachable one of the best professors ever
15719,Mark  Kenney,nonviolent warrior had extremely boring lectures over explain things he will keep you the full hours and minutes
15720,Mark  Kenney,men in transition is an easy a
15721,Mark  Kenney,kenney and clark are a great pair ok
15722,Mark  Kenney,stay away very boring
15723,Mark  Kenney,no comments
15724,Mark  Kenney,no comments
15725,Marc  Bourdeau,ce prof ne structure aucunement sa matiere autant au niveau du plan de cours classe en plus avec un receuil de notes incomplet fait par lui et vous obtenez un cours extrement facile auquel vous ne comprenez rien le livre optionnel est obligatoire avec lui
15726,Marc  Bourdeau,un professeur qui pas les exemples donnent sont tout ce y a retenir pour les examens
15727,Marc  Bourdeau,nice professor
15728,Marc  Bourdeau,le prof est sympathique et aidant horsclasse mais son cours est assez disparate en effet essayer de suivre le fil de son discours est difficile il ne suit pas vraiment le plan de cours et semble toujours avoir une anecdote horssujet dire mais la base le cours est facile faite vos lectures et surtout les exos de la semaine
15729,Marc  Bourdeau,pretentieux
15730,Marc  Bourdeau,utterly mean pretentious and obnoxious
15731,Jim  Lissemore,the class is a handful of small lab reports that can be graded tough lab notebook checks and participation the participation grade can save you he is very sweet wants to help and is very considerate he is incredibly intelligent so sometimes his lectures are over heads
15732,Jim  Lissemore,very tough grader a very goof professor though explains everything very clear you must study every night to pass his tests his tests might not seem too hard but trust me they are very difficult would recommend him to anyone but you must be willing to dedicate a lot of time to this class
15733,Jim  Lissemore,very clear and great in lecture he grades his tests tough but if you know the notes and do all of the practice problems they that bad
15734,Jim  Lissemore,clear lectures and notes if you cover the review sheets that he gives you you will do fine very helpful and great explainer would take him again
15735,Jim  Lissemore,took him for genetics he was a fantastic teacher taken the class with other teachers and thought that genetics was harder with lissemore i actually got an a recommend him all the way if you have the choice take him you regret it prefer him over other bio teachers in the department too
15736,Jim  Lissemore,it was a very rough class one thing to know about this guy is that he grades harshly exams were difficult e.g he expects you to memorize word for word definitions from the chapter and reproduce it on the exam he also had reading assignments for inclass discussions regarding bioethics which were pointless and time consuming
15737,Jim  Lissemore,lectures are clear and interesting he is a good teacher and learn a lot grades just based on exams he likes to have us write papers and have discussions a nice break from lectures and exams on exams and papers he is extremely picky make sure your definitions are word for word and your writing is as concise as possible
15738,Jim  Lissemore,dr lissemore is the best he will do anything for his students and works extremely hard for you be prepared to work hard as well and come to learn any class he teaches is completely worth your time
15739,Jim  Lissemore,prepared explains things clearly well thoughtout powerpoints clear detailed assignment handouts spends more time helping students more than office hours require you will learn alot cons not objective in grading unreasonably picky assigns busy work picks favorite students dominates convo you might not get the grade you deserve
15740,Jim  Lissemore,tests are impossible i would walk out of an exam thinking i did very well but when i recieved it back i basically did very poorly very picky with any answer given on a test or exam
15741,Jim  Lissemore,best class i have taken at jcu best class to prepare you for grad school if you make this class a priority and put in the time you will definately learn a lot exams are hard because they really challenge you to think in a short amount of time
15742,Jim  Lissemore,extremely tough grader and gives no breaks make sure you pay attention to that syllabus because he follows it wordtoword and gives no chances unless your dog died and you have a death certificate to prove it hard exams but the project is cool for the biological impacts of poverty class you will work your ass off in this class
15743,Jim  Lissemore,jim is a great guy do anything to help you which is not to say he spoonfeeds you you have to do the work although not necessarily all that he tells you to do and you know i came in expecting to be bored out of my mind but he does a great job breaking up lecture with good discussion if you need genetics this is the way to go
15744,Jim  Lissemore,dr l will tell you everything you need to know if you do the suggested homework you can definitely do wellyou need the book for homework this class is awesome
15745,Jim  Lissemore,this guy is great i care what anyone else says he takes time to make things crystal clear and would be glad to help if you go and see him he never tests you on anything he cover you really need a book the class is challenging but if into this stuff you may find it easy
15746,Jim  Lissemore,dr lissemore knows his genetics and his history the class is very difficult and requires patience to understand and comprehend but worthwhile learned a lot in a short time btw this material is on the mcat and if you want to take that you need this class and he will definately prep you for that
15747,Jim  Lissemore,this guy has no idea what doing if he understand wrong cross his mind that maybe you know something he really not sure that a guy who is not uptodate with new genetic testing and studies should be teaching about it
15748,Jim  Lissemore,although the subject matter was extremely difficult this guy makes it clear and fun to learn very helpful and always willing to sit down with you and thoroughly answer all questions gives you note packets too so you have to write
15749,Jim  Lissemore,one of the best professors i have ever had class is extremely structured effort is required learned a lot from his class nice guy too
15750,Jim  Lissemore,too many kids drop his class to say doing it right if so many kids fail a test something is wrong cause its not bc they try
15751,Jules  O\'Shea,probablement le pire prof de toute des profs avoir cours on constate vite vaut mieux lire les notes de cours mises jour en il fait des bruits bizares en classe et on dirait est toujours sur le point de crever vieille croute tu
15752,Jules  O\'Shea,a boring teacher believe me with absolutely no gift to teach anything he is one of the worst teacher ever and can even makes the most interesting subject into a thing you hear about anymore by the way he is a specialist at giving you critical information at the last moment like the place of an exam hours before it
15753,Jules  O\'Shea,is convinced that open book exams make it quicker to perform matrix computations lectures will put you in hibernating state
15754,Farida  Cheriet,bonne prof
15755,Farida  Cheriet,a pleasant personality diligent and dynamic i thoroughly enjoy working with her on my project she is vesatile in all branches of computer engineering and always willing to give a hand when needed to sum it all up what an amazing prof

15760,Farida  Cheriet,comme la critique mentionne souriante ouverte aux malheureusement le cours ne sert fournir des colles pour les examens qui ne comptent pour rien au projet justement dans le projet que apprend le plus un conseil pas vous investir fond dans le projet

15776,Mark  Wessel,he is a very nice teacher you can get an a if you pay close attention on what he is really asking you to this was a very fun and cool class
15777,Mark  Wessel,he is an awesome teacher his class was a prerequisite to classes i really wanted to take he made the class fun he really is a good teacher
15778,Mark  Wessel,he is a great teacher he lectures well the class was challenging for me but it was fun his grading system is detailed and you certainly learn the basics of design quite well in his class i would take any class from him again for sure
15779,Mark  Wessel,you certainly learn a lot in his class a little too much homework but it is all worth end of the term his grading is fair and his lectures are great
15780,Mark  Wessel,no comments
15781,Mark  Wessel,he is an excellent art teacher i had lots of fun in his class and it hard at all if you take art you need to have good craft to do well but his assignments are very fun the class is very enjoyable and he is a person you can easily talk to
15782,Mark  Wessel,very good instructor and specific about his expectations would take another class from him any time if you like to follow directions expect to do well artistic license comes in upper division class not foundation ones
15783,Garrison  Sposito,professor sposito a blindingly brilliant lecturer but he gets the information across clearly he really cares about the subject i think but just the most interesting lecturer he does post lecture slides on bcourses which really helps with exam preparation
15784,Garrison  Sposito,classes like this are the reason i came to this school brilliant kind interested engaged professor who goes above and beyond to facilitate learning often wished lectures be over so quickly this class is friendly to science and humanities students creative and thought provoking if you go in with the right mind
15785,Garrison  Sposito,one of the two best teachers had at cal very very smart and he explains science in a way easy for humanities types like me to understand supernice guy too highly recommended
15786,Garrison  Sposito,i liked prof sposito a lot even though i took this class for hass i found myself enjoying lectures a lot more he was organized passionate and really laid back you get the feeling he really cares about the subject and his students
15787,Garrison  Sposito,boring lecturer too much reading he was equally but the class hard study guides for all tests writing assignments were easy lecture was just horribly monotonous and totally useless rarely went
15788,Garrison  Sposito,boring monotonous lecturer he could have made the material so much more exciting he always talked up the guest speakers to the point where it sounded fake too much reading but midterms hard
15789,Garrison  Sposito,crosslisted as englishc77 ugis12 cotaught by prof hass the reading load was heavy several articles a week but besides writing assignments no big papers or projects the workload was light both professors are passionate and care genuinely for students exams are fair study guides provided each time i loved the class but i like eng
15790,Garrison  Sposito,lectures are not well organized textbook is terrible not helpful via email not in scheduled office hours
15791,Garrison  Sposito,this class bad i enjoyed some of the readings in the reader did not realize it was cross listed with english before i took it too much literary analysis involved for a crs major like myself i got the english gsi so i felt like she graded my essays strictly get the gsis if more science inclined and vice versa
15792,Garrison  Sposito,professor sposito is fantastic he makes environmental studies fascinating and painless for students who necessarily excited about science he also brings in some amazing guest lecturers
15793,Garrison  Sposito,a great envi sci professor because he make you feel depressed about the subject he wants to inspire you to help save the planet you should take this class one of a kind
15794,Garrison  Sposito,i think he is still in class to pass the time away he calls so many other people to talk in class i think he is lazy
15795,Garrison  Sposito,no joke i developed a crush on him because he was so passionate about his work his students and the environment awesome guy wow i actually miss attending his lectures
15796,Garrison  Sposito,sposito is great very knowledgable clear insightful dedicated just great
15797,Garrison  Sposito,excellent professor very passionate about the subject and full of interesting information very friendly and approachable this class was the bright spot in my otherwise awful schedule
15798,Garrison  Sposito,he was such a great teacher so understanding and very helpful i learned so much from him take him
15799,Garrison  Sposito,clear intelligent and a delight to work with
15800,Garrison  Sposito,dazzling intellect and a concern for students not often seen at cal
15801,Bob  Gillies,great prof knowledge is second hand to none so far of those who met so far in my life grading scale is clear will stay as long as you need after class to help you on anything you need even offers to help students with other classes if he can had him for a couple classes learned a lot from him
15802,Bob  Gillies,kind of blah he teaches science and really thought more about his science classes then our math class felt stupid in this class felt stupid because of the teacher
15803,Bob  Gillies,he teaches science and is very knowledgeable in science and make class fun and the labs are fun also took both of my sciences with him get you to think
15804,Bob  Gillies,i didnt learn anything about math other then how to get frustrated just sad getting good gpa is imporntan to me and this class totally killed it not all teachers fault but i felt like i was board and very frustrated with gilles i felt he looked down on the math beginers people who didnt have a or first timers in college
15805,Bob  Gillies,bob has a fantastic understanding of calculus sometimes he notice if you need him to slow down or go over something again be assertive and help
15806,Bob  Gillies,great teacher wicked easy and supper helpful i loved every min o his class and he is writing the text book so there is no book to buy supper plus
15807,Bob  Gillies,what a great prof if you want to learn and advence into calc this is the one who will give you the right knowlage to integrate and learn something valuable that will come handy on your next calc class very smart and fun prof loves teaching you new stuff
15808,Bob  Gillies,i had this guy last year and let me tell you that after every class i would go to my car and start crying he made me feel stupid and pretty much i was board but still tried very hard i was so frustrated again i left almost every class in tears
15809,Bob  Gillies,gillies is just a bad teacher plain and simple just bad horrible i was soo unmotivated by his teachings i was just at a loss one of my first college classes and i wanted to quit college because of how bad of a teacher he is like if your a strong math or science student i think youll do fine he just created way to much anxity for me
15810,Bob  Gillies,bad bad bad thats it
15811,Bob  Gillies,i hated this class he was very fastpaced and not a good teacher grade was based on tests only no homework attendence or participation taken into consideration
15812,Bob  Gillies,ok first i just have to say my dad is a high school math teacher so in addition for going to extra help in the math center i still could not get modivated for this class he is very monotone he was very would go home and have my dad teach me gillies talks about to much science i mean its a basic algera class not med school.horroable
15813,Bob  Gillies,i didnt like him i think is was very boring grented it was math but still
15814,Bob  Gillies,lost the boat with the physics too much physics stop it with the drawings take class if you like to tackle engineering projects do not take class if you have any form of sanity whatsoever not a math class and do not learn much however he knows how to teach and for the right student well done
15815,Bob  Gillies,got me into math got me into calc got me into wpi best math tacher ever and a physicist not a mathmatician i love it
15816,Bob  Gillies,best math teacher i ever had also teaches some of the history of mathematics this is extra knowledge that is hard to find anywhere nice nice professor
15817,Bob  Gillies,this guy will bend over backwords to make sure you understand the material and that you pass the class and the fact that he gives you photocopies of the notes is key
15818,Cathy  Holtmann,very interesting course although cathy says the last time teach it make sure to attend every class attendance is a big factor also keep up with readings and responses because they account for the majority of your mark there was a lot of time for personal reflection which was enjoyable good class
15819,Cathy  Holtmann,she is boring she is clear easy and helpful though she always keeps you until the last minute she much fun sometimes seems to fake an interest in the material
15820,Cathy  Holtmann,cathy rocks she cares about her students and whats teaching about she even gives us her cell number in case we need her how cool is that deffinitly the best stu
15821,Cathy  Holtmann,excellent prof keeps things energetic and fun is very interested in peoples theories and opinions very fun class i love it
15822,Cathy  Holtmann,i just loved her the best professor i ever had she has so much enthusiasm and created such a pleasant environment she even hosted a party at the end of the year for our class the very best at stu
15823,Cathy  Holtmann,awsome she listens to what you have to say without critisizing and is truly interested in what she is teaching the class is a breeze and her lectures are actually interesting
15824,Cathy  Holtmann,excellent prof very helpfull and friendly lectures are interesting and group work is fun one of the best classes taken
15825,Cathy  Holtmann,i lover her very interested in what going and when we have group discussions she sometimes sits with us and just talks to us like regular people i really recommend her a great person
15826,Cathy  Holtmann,a feminist but not in an idiotic way good once you get used to her style nice

15829,Mary  Moss,why did they let her go
15830,Mary  Moss,completely worthless class did not learn anything her critisims of your speech is vague and plays favorites with her class if she likes you you will get a good grade if you do not show the level of interst that she believes you should you are in for a long semester wish i had taken steele instead
15831,Mary  Moss,worthless
15832,Mary  Moss,awesome awesome teacher and they should let her stay
15833,Mary  Moss,no comments
15834,Mary  Moss,no comments
15835,Mary  Moss,glad i had her as a teacher for frs140 it was a stupid class but she really helped a lot and all we ever did was talk in her class she had a genuine interest in our opinions and ideas very fun and energetic person
15836,Mary  Moss,dr moss makes school fun sweetest and most energetic teacher ever
15837,Mary  Moss,a little scatter brained says umm every sentence not for slackers she expects the very best from everyone
15838,Mary  Moss,expects a lot but will help slackers beware
15839,Mary  Moss,no comments
15840,Mary  Moss,definitely an energetic teacher helpful all you have to do is ask
15841,Andrea  Tyree,hello andrea i was a student of yours at ucla and liked and admired you teaching very much thank you i still remember what you taught bill williams ucla jd
15842,Andrea  Tyree,tyree is a huge bore she will put you to sleep most of the time shes very unorganized plays with her laptop for half the class and talks about google earth which did not help teach anything about population and society.her test questions are given to you before the exams but they require thorough reading.take if u must otherwise stay away
15843,Andrea  Tyree,shes nice but a complete space cadet who goes off on tangents all the time her tests are hard and she grades harshly but she curves at the end which is good the class is soo boring i wouldnt reccommed it unless u are actually interested in it
15844,Andrea  Tyree,had her for sweet lady loves what she does boring lectures tedious work assigned essay tests must read text in order to do well in this class goes on tangents most of the time attendance is mandatory dont recommend this class
15845,Andrea  Tyree,this class is easy she explains computer assignments using a program known as spss in easy to follow steps good attendance is a must cause a lot of the lecture material as well as class readings ends up on essay exams if you take the optional final your lowest grade is dropped your lowest computer hw grade is dropped
15846,Andrea  Tyree,highly recommend for research methods no text no annoying group work essay exams i admit you will feel kind of lost in the class sometimes in lab but u will see in the end she is so much better than other research methods professors if you understand speak up she is understanding and helps during office hours
15847,Andrea  Tyree,definitely an easy a the tests are essay exams and she give you the questions a week before the exam do them prior to the test and you will get a good grade she is an easy grader
15848,Andrea  Tyree,space cadet but easy a
15849,Andrea  Tyree,hard to understand her so i suggest sitting in front of the class her lectures tend to be a bit boring but a fair grader all her tests are essays and she gives you possible questions before hand so you can prepare easy a
15850,Andrea  Tyree,very easy class since teacher talks about one fact per test and each class is examining the same thing again and again very boring but worth the time for an a
15851,Andrea  Tyree,her population class is extremely easy there is no textbook just a couple readings that are easy to understand there is a portfolio due at the end of the semester but that is extremely easy and the best part is that she will drop your lowest test grade including the final and her exams are easy
15852,Andrea  Tyree,understand a word the woman says
15853,Detlef  Gromoll,despite the negative comments posted on here about the professor he is a very nice guy he has a thick german accent that makes it difficult at times to understand the lesson but he makes things clear enough to understand do the homework and extra credit the tests are easier than the homework so if you pass these you should be fine
15854,Detlef  Gromoll,everyone here seems to be giving hi bad reviews but really a nice guy a little bit hard to understand but you get used to it tests are really easy and usually a big curve do the homework and get a good grade i loved him
15855,Detlef  Gromoll,i really like him atfirst he may seem offputting but really nice math is math not fun but he knows many people are taking it for the dec so there are several opportunities for extra credit he also realizes and states in class that not everyone will do so great on the second midterm and the curve will be generous a
15856,Detlef  Gromoll,although he does get a bit incomprehensible at times he is a pretty good math teacher i am rather sure i am getting am a in his class and although sometimes i go for reasons that i just want to or emergencies i never feel like i fell too far behind rock on detlef
15857,Detlef  Gromoll,a really good guy very intelligent yeah he talks like arnold a bit but funny the people who commented bad stuff about him are probably idiots who know how to pay attention for more than minutes really good guy not a hard class
15858,Detlef  Gromoll,this guy was horrible point blank i would ask him a question he would answer a different question wack
15859,Detlef  Gromoll,he doesnt teach well he talks to the board and doesnt answer questions he wont help you if you have a problem with your grade and he very organized
15860,Detlef  Gromoll,do this to yourself seriously a horrible teacher absolutely horrible he gets mad when students ask questions and he disgards questions most of the time he is so lost on what teaching he def will not help at all
15861,Detlef  Gromoll,i have no idea why math teachers keep getting more and more ridiculous this professor is very hard to understand and at random points during his lecture runs of in tangents about other things he is fast paced and due to the difficult dragging lectures i left feeling stupider if i reluctantly decided to theclass not happy
15862,Detlef  Gromoll,this professor was incredibly boring while teaching the class he talks to the blackboard and you can only understand every other word believe me if have a hard time with prof is def not the prof for you
15863,Detlef  Gromoll,worst professor ever he speaks to the board mumbles makes mistakes often explain things to the class gets frustrated when asked questions barely speaks english horrible despite all of that the only reason i got an a was because it was easy math but going to class made me want to hurl an eraser at his head
15864,Detlef  Gromoll,i went twice and got an a as long as you do the hw you will be fine and the math is a joke however the two times that i did go i wanted to jump out the window he is awful he mumbles speaks awful english and gets frustrated after the second question but take the class for the easy credit trust me
15865,Detlef  Gromoll,okay he gives you many opportunities to raise your grade if you do your work you will probably do fine
15866,Detlef  Gromoll,this post is for those students who are serious about math if you can take a level course with him do so he teaches and he gives you every chance in the world to do well his exams are out of points but is considered a perfect score he also gives extra credit projects if you need them good class good teacher take him
15867,Detlef  Gromoll,best teacher such a cute guy and very smart and nice knows his math
15868,Detlef  Gromoll,such a sweet guy and seems genuinely crushed that no one comes to his lectures attending recitation and getting good grades on exams is all you really need a pretty easy course.if you have a heart go to his lectures on occasion a sweet old man no one wants to know boring
15869,Detlef  Gromoll,the guy is smart but teach for his life the math is easy and the book is very good so if your even decent at math then definitly take this course subjects include compounding interest probability election theory etc
15870,Detlef  Gromoll,he is hard to understand because of his accent if you do all of the work attend recitations and do the extra credit at the end which hard0 you will get at least a b i am horrible at math and my tests were horrible in the class and i pulled off a b

15873,Ewing  Chinn,having graduated years ago now dr chinn is one of the trinity professors i look back on ith the most fondness i took intro chinese phil and logic from him and always found him to be kindhearted and humorous
15874,Ewing  Chinn,i have no idea how this man became the chair smart guy but his teaching skills are horrible beyond belief never makes himself available
15875,Ewing  Chinn,really hard to understand him since he mumbles and slurs all his words and then when he writes a word on the board illegible if you read figure the stuff out though
15876,Ewing  Chinn,wtf is he saying
15877,Ewing  Chinn,i disagree with the other comments he takes a very subtle approach to teaching it but asian philosophy is a very subtle subject he really cares about the subject and gives a lot of leeway when it comes to picking your paper topics not boring
15878,Ewing  Chinn,this class was alright i mean bored outta your mind is better than wishing you took an easier class
15879,Ewing  Chinn,worst teacher ever had never available for help boring and completely inarticulate avoid at all costs
15880,Ewing  Chinn,i thought dr chinn was very approachable and helpful the area of philosophy clear to begin with and i think the way he teaches it is more helpful than memorizing terms out of a book
15881,Ewing  Chinn,was very excited about this class but ended up hating it lectures and thoughts are very unorganized i attended every class and feel like i have learned a thing it was a total waste of time and money
15882,Ewing  Chinn,it seems that professor chinn values his own opinions only even more unfortunate it is nearly impossible to understand his opinions because he cannot articulate himself he is also completely unhelpful
15883,Nirmal  Gupta,great
15884,Nirmal  Gupta,i believe a marketing prof is teaching managerial economics ah well not overall a bad prof just not organized poorly structured exams and very very boring when his class got audited by the chair the dude fell asleep lol make sure to review the textbook and practice all the calculus or do poorly on exams
15885,Nirmal  Gupta,one of the best profs had i had him for both qms classes last year anyone that says his midterms are tough clearly needs to sit down and study harder his midterms are nothing but fair i got a percent on one of them he really wants to help his students so he goes over the material really well i would defiantly recommend taking him
15886,Nirmal  Gupta,such a tough prof
15887,Nirmal  Gupta,he tries to be funny but he is a tough midterm and finla are soo hard
15888,Nirmal  Gupta,easyy peasy
15889,Nirmal  Gupta,awesomee teacher super easy tests are exactly what he says they will be in class this is my time takin stats the first one i had with jason nirmal is easier
15890,Nirmal  Gupta,just work hard and attend classes you can get an with this guy trust me
15891,Nirmal  Gupta,i had him again for still the same nice prof content is slightly tougher but not bad he ensures ppl understands and sometimes adds some humor quizzes were easy but his midterm was tough most of the class suffered but he was fair on marking the spss project and quiz just practice the hw qs and ask help helpful btw when needed
15892,Nirmal  Gupta,he is a very good teacher good speaker and funny too most of his quizzes you just need the calculator which he teaches how to use goes over the examples in class well got before exam but after i jsut dropped he cowrote the exam but it was way too hard in my opinion most people that had a going in dropped to bs and cs
15893,Nirmal  Gupta,people who are saying hard are probably really dumb this course is a joke especially with him the calculator does everything for you his are super easy just attend class and study off his examples and get a easily a really good prof and is also very funny i highly recommend taking him for stats
15894,Nirmal  Gupta,this tests are ridiculously hard most of the time i understand what he was asking for on the tests studying from the textbook help at all
15895,Nirmal  Gupta,very nice and enthusiastic professor his are pretty easy he is very helpful when you understand some questions even though he summarizes the textbook read and do the questions and you will be fine
15896,Nirmal  Gupta,definitely explains everything the fullest tried to be funny and make the class entertaining but like it is qms it never will be but good for trying tests are fair and pretty easy course cause he doesnt complicate things
15897,Nirmal  Gupta,best prof i ever had after failing qms i took the course again and got an a he is very patient and explains until you fully understand he would review the material learned in the previous class and give good examples if you attend his classes you will be fine
15898,Nirmal  Gupta,so surprised at the ratings this prof has recieved he is an amazing teacher he explains very well if you go to class and take notes you will do great he never tries to trick you and tests and exams are very easy great prof overall
15899,Nirmal  Gupta,mixed review as his explanations are hard to understand but he is a very dedicated professor who gives lots of support posts tonnes of stuff and seems enthusiastic he wont be a hinderance at all but the text pretty much teaches most things you need to know but i when he failed a basic stats question in front of the class
15900,Nirmal  Gupta,an airhead who teach well he makes mistakes during class and confuses you during class stick to the book sleep during class and be fine
15901,Nirmal  Gupta,this guy is awsome hard to understand yes but posts many helpful solutions on blackboard and our section covered addtional chapters that no other qms class covered and we all failed but gave us opportunities by changing the weight of our final according to which get the highest possible grade above all i think this prof is very helpful
15902,Nirmal  Gupta,a very good prof if stats is not your area of expertise take him he wil make you understand qstns on exams are diff from txt book but are the same as what he does in class attending class is recommended is a little condecending but whatever right as long as he explains things well thats what really matters
15903,Ed  Pavlic,really into books a little eccentric but a great professor all about the deeper meaning in books so be ready to actually do the reading cliff and spark notes help you in his class a tough grader especially on essays but take solace in the fact that he lets you know what he wants so it be a surprise
15904,Ed  Pavlic,pavlic is a little bit eccentric but he a real intellectual he expects as much genuine interest in learning and writing about the material as he puts into teaching it which is to say a lot if students put in the time to read everyhting and pay attention in class the rewards are worth the effort
15905,Ed  Pavlic,enthusiastic
15906,Ed  Pavlic,sucks
15907,Ed  Pavlic,a bit confusing
15908,Ed  Pavlic,a pretty tough grader but he basically tells you what he wants he takes writing seriously and rates reading even higher than that if an intellectual your kind of professor if lazy and just his course cuz you think be easy bother showing up
15909,Ed  Pavlic,incredibly smart wayy left wing soo disillusioned with the u.s
15910,Ed  Pavlic,no comments
15911,Ed  Pavlic,brilliant and beautiful keep the blues going
15912,Ed  Pavlic,one of my favorite profs went off on weird tangents but obviously knew and loved the material
15913,Sandra  Brown,she is a great grader if you hand in a paper shell correct it and hand it back then you fix it and give it to her youll pass she only uses your top paper and test grades and gets rid of the other ones
15914,Sandra  Brown,does not use canvas very unorganized loses papers does not know what to do unclear instructions no drop boxes no grades online even say our grades when we ask you will know by the end of the semester is what she says very unfair what if someone is failing also does not reply any emails very not recommended waste of and time
15915,Sandra  Brown,professor brown is all over the place when being assigned essays and such we were never given a concrete answer of due dates or when an assignment was due of the time the class was confused no note taking only watching youtube videos and being tested on handouts i enjoy this class in the slightest
15916,Sandra  Brown,definitely take her class for eng as long as you attend class do your work and polite to her she will love you papers are only a page long and your final is a group project easy a
15917,Sandra  Brown,dr brown is one of the most passionate professors i have ever had she loves modernism and postmodernism and it shows i learned so much and was able to apply what i learned in other courses it was a fun easy class and i would highly recommend taking a course with dr brown
15918,Sandra  Brown,dr brown is one of the best professors i have ever had this course truly feels like what you might expect for an elective fun simple and engaging all of the writing comes from your heart no outside research is necessary i had her for both postmodernism and modernism but you need to take modernism for postmodernism i recommend
15919,Sandra  Brown,she is the most easiest teacher ever seriously if you have to take eng take her everything is easy the papers only have to be a page long very nice i absolutely recommend her she is a bit crazy and most immature people tolerate her but if you want an easy a here you go
15920,Sandra  Brown,dr sandra brown is such an exciting professor i took her for modernism and will definitely take her for postmodernism she has great passion for the material that she teaches a rarity to see these days i def recommend her for the humanities courses as for grade it is whatever you want no tricks quizzes short papers very doable
15921,Sandra  Brown,she is a good teacher but not very helpful to the students on a equal level
15922,Sandra  Brown,dr brown is quite an interesting individual and her class was quite disorganized with the formatting clarifications and changing of rooms fortunately dr humor and execution made up for it and she is one of the sweetest instructors on the occ campus i took her postmodernism since a class of mine got cancelled but i hold no regrets
15923,Sandra  Brown,dr brown was an incredible professor a little cray cray but i loved her all the same she really made class fun and her crazy comments always made me laugh definitely take her awesome
15924,Sandra  Brown,this teacher is the bomb she is easy you will just have to do a couple papers and her tests are also easy if you try really hard then u wasted ur time u can barely try and get a b or try a little bit and get an a shes is so easy to understand and she isnt boring take this teacher
15925,Sandra  Brown,she is the best professor i have had yet.if you can get her go for it
15926,Sandra  Brown,shes good pure awesomeness
15927,Sandra  Brown,no joke an amazing teacher and really cares about her students take her trust all the comments
15928,Sandra  Brown,she is very helpful the class was so were the tests as long as you paid attention and did your homework you would do fine take her
15929,Sandra  Brown,dr brown is a fantastic teacher who has a true passion for teaching she truly cares about her students and is willing to do anything to help them succeed her funny and great personality makes class fun and class is never boring ever an easy a as long as you do well on your assignments and tests and show up for class
15930,Sandra  Brown,honestly this lady would be better off teaching middle school english work is very childish and not challenging at all she is a very nice lady but very disorganized assigns a lot of work but very unclear when it is due easy a but would have actually like to have learned something anything actually
15931,Sandra  Brown,awesome professor fair honest and down to earth
15932,Sandra  Brown,most interesting class with up to date topics all work was clear lots of films and group projects never boring
15933,Fred  Simmond,great guy always willing to help would love to have him again
15934,Fred  Simmond,prof simmonds is the best he makes class interesting and fun i got a b from him and i hate english i would recommend anyone to take him if you like english
15935,Fred  Simmond,if you are looking for an easy a this is the guy wo give it to you but if you are looking for an actual education take a professor that has a degree in english fred simmonds is a waste of money
15936,Fred  Simmond,great guy great class
15937,Fred  Simmond,great teacher great class great time
15938,Fred  Simmond,he is so easy funny and laid back if not into english i recommend taking him not uptight and has street smarts unlike some professors
15939,Fred  Simmond,get him out
15940,Fred  Simmond,this dude is a joke
15941,Fred  Simmond,likes controversy nothing gets done though great personality but nothing gets done
15942,Fred  Simmond,this teacher is easy as balls he will give you a c just for signing up i think i had like assignments the whole semester and even if you do them and you show up get a b
15943,Fred  Simmond,no comments
15944,Fred  Simmond,no comments
15945,Fred  Simmond,this guy could care less if u write a thing all u have to do is show up and say a few things and if u liek your gread jsut ask hell change it def take him its cake
15946,Fred  Simmond,soo funny he just wants to have fun and have a lot of debates with him oh god haha he is the coolest teacher ever i had
15947,Mathew  Horn,he has you discover the chemistry this has you understand why the rules are the way the rules are and understand why things work the way they do
15948,Mathew  Horn,dr horn has a very unique teaching style in short he really teach everything you need to know will come from the textbook the inclass activities will just confuse you and waste your time his tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned this class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses find another teacher
15949,Mathew  Horn,literally the worst teacher ever had do not take his class the average on every test was below a percent i studied everyday for at least hours the tests relevant to anything you learn in class he teach you anything i ended up with a percent in the class and he round up to a b for me
15950,Mathew  Horn,literally the worst teacher ever had do not take his class the average on every test was below a percent i studied everyday for at least hours the tests relevant to anything you learn in class he teach you anything i ended up with a percent in the class and he round up to a b for me
15951,Mathew  Horn,do not take him he is more worried about his group study than the students the average on the final was and that is considering the curve i ended up with around on the final and i ended with a b the tests are only question each so if you miss your already below he lectured for a total of a couple hours in the semester
15952,Mathew  Horn,prof class is extremely difficult group work every single day daily assignments can be confusing at times exams are super frustrating and hard the worst exam set up experienced at uvu he seems super unapproachable in class that being said one on one he is one of the nicest dudes you can go to him and he will help you out
15953,Mathew  Horn,he is a great teacher when he teaches which is not very often he knows the subject very well and is passionate about it however he hardly lectures the first day of the semester he sticks you in groups and you better hope you get a good group because you will be each others teachers for the semester
15954,Mathew  Horn,not much lecturing mostly groupwork and a lot of self teaching a lot of people like the way set up but i mind it teaching this way forces students to actually learn the material and it makes the final a lot easier the class easy but not really supposed to be get to know the people in your group
15955,Mathew  Horn,this is the most frustrating class i have ever taken he literally does not teach he gives you chemactivities and you are supposed to learn from your fellow students the only plus is you get multiple chances to get the correct answer on on a computer i would not recommend him at all
15956,Mathew  Horn,my advice skip class do the homework problems and ask for help if you need it horn goes straight to the tutoring lab every day after class and if you ask for help he gladly will underestimate the exams try to study with someone else who is in the class teaching each other and learning together will help you more than book work
15957,Mathew  Horn,take chemistry from horn he is more concerned about how your are participating in his pogil project then teaching sometimes he answers students questions hit and miss most of time spent working in groups very little lecture homework solutions are hidden by the professor does not teach engaged learning at uvu
15958,Mathew  Horn,he puts you in a group of and gives you chemactivities to work on every day he lectures for min and then leaves you with your group to figure out how to do chemistry when i asked him a question he responded look it up in the book this is a teach yourself class expect to learn anything from him worst teacher ever had
15959,Mathew  Horn,he is actually funny and very passionate about chemistry he understands that this class is a lower level chemistry class and require you to know things above this class he responds to questions quickly and helped with any problem i had you are responsible to teach yourself this class is in no way a breeze go to class and read your book
15960,Mathew  Horn,this class requires alot of self teaching i liked the class and the group that i was assigned to you must go to class he does in class clicker questions that are graded he responded to questions very quickly read the book make sure you know your stuff because its up to you to learn the material he lecture in class at all
15961,Mathew  Horn,this class has very little lecture but when he does lecture pay attention those concepts usually end up on an exam you work out of a book in groups every class midterm exams written by him final is a national exam mastering chemistry hw each week would have gotten a better grade had i put more time into it
15962,Mathew  Horn,avoid is arrogant acs test scores are national we do terrible on it here at uvu take chem both semesters at byu or the u in the summer not with him not with him not with him
15963,Mathew  Horn,my worst experience in this university so far absolutely confusing you go take the test equally prepared every time and one time you get an a another a c then a then c random infuriating experience i get in high math classes and came out discouraged from his class avoid at any cost
15964,Mathew  Horn,one of the most unhelpful teachers when it comes to teaching if you like teaching yourself than this is the teacher for you it very helpful when you and your group have no idea what he is even teaching on i would say never take it from him
15965,Mathew  Horn,he thinks he teaches pogil but the g in pogil method stand for guided which he do he is lazy if you go to his office or stay after class to ask him to work out a difficult problem he ever do it if you ask for a way to see the steps he give it when people say he is fair due to his ridiculously huge curve
15966,Mathew  Horn,one of the absolute worst professors at uvu the class is hard and he makes it that much harder if he is your only option take it he brags about how hard test are avg on one test was on a class with over students and he said he was impressed that people had such a high average avoid at all costs
15967,Johnetta  Richards,i really enjoyed dr class she has amazing lectures that are based on her life experience and she is hilarious but beware miss her class or your grade will go down she takes attendance every day and will notice if you are absent be careful and always turn in assignments on syllabus even if she does not ask for them on due date
15968,Johnetta  Richards,professor richard is seen as one of the most difficult teachers when i took this class i felt like it was hard to focus because we rarely stayed on task you definitely have to read the books and attendance is mandatory she grades super hard but i feel like if you actually try your end grade will be acceptable
15969,Johnetta  Richards,do yourself a huge favor choose richards she is extremely unorganized in her lectures rambles about nonsense for the first min of the class and then expects you to have actually learned something class is out of pts w pop quizzes worth the final paper which you put hours and hours into worth makes no sense unfair
15970,Johnetta  Richards,horrible i worked so hard in this class but richards does not care about that got my mid hour essay mid term grade back the day before the final and i recieved a she does not email students back which is the only way to communicate none of her assigned videos worked and she would not help fix that problem
15971,Johnetta  Richards,do not take if you must play nice learn names dates important events and basic bio of assigned person ignore all assigned reading exam given one week in advance plenty to time to prep if you are strong student do not skip class but you will want to pop quiz term paper exams respond to each sentence of question be specific
15972,Johnetta  Richards,i took her african american history class in usf dr richards is a great professor she taught history in afrocentric perspective she cares about her students very much be aware of the pop quizzes for midterm and final exams if you put works on it and do what she asks you to do you will definitely get a good grades
15973,Johnetta  Richards,horrible i read reviews about how tough she was but i chose to ignore them thinking that they were exaggerating her instructions are not clear she expects things to be done if not done she gives you a low grade does not give feedback in a timely manner do not take her class she teach she assigns reading videos from sfsu lib
15974,Johnetta  Richards,do not take this class if looking for an easy a or if looking to work on this class less than hours a day insane intense and the hardest class ever taken but also the most interesting and engaging only take it if you have time and feel fascinated by the subject life changing experience for me for sure
15975,Johnetta  Richards,do believe the hype dr richards is funny honest and fair she requires you to buy the book the questions for the midterm and final come mainly from them dont use your phone in class she hates that she gave the whole class a makeup quiz because we didnt follow her instructions on the midterm i loved the class and learned alot
15976,Johnetta  Richards,dont do it i took this class online for a ge over the summer hour long films from the sfsu library every day boring no lecture every single one of her emails was condescending and rude did not do any teaching herself she just piled on the work and sent rude emails about how students never put in work or effort avoid at all costs
15977,Johnetta  Richards,focuses too much on student misbehaviors no extra credit will kick you out of class if you text mandatory attendance give students enough motivation to truly succeed and help them knows subject material well but acts far too superior over her students very difficult final exam and paper thankful i was able to pass this class
15978,Johnetta  Richards,would not recommend this teacher she clear on what she wants in assignments then has the nerve to be offended at confusion does not cover class readings in lectures awful temper and seems to expect the worst out of her students i quote from her syllabus students usually do not research the proper way to document internet
15979,Johnetta  Richards,take this class is you want an easy a or if you do not plan on attending class every class a lot of the learning comes from the text books movies participation is a must i got a lot out of arfs really tough midterm and final you must read it was a challenge but if you show up participate read you will survive this tough cookie
15980,Johnetta  Richards,you can put your self in out ppl shoes and understand then your essays will be easy when she assigns you a wants to know and the gossip she wants the juicy stuff miss the books cuz that can be extra credit just having em
15981,Johnetta  Richards,she is an amazing teacher as long as a good student not rocket science the subjects are not difficult you just need to actually put effort into it to get a good grade but that how all college courses should be
15982,Johnetta  Richards,you will learn a lot in this class i enjoyed reading the material and her lectures were very informative dont take this class if you want an easy a because you will not get one you must work for it
15983,Johnetta  Richards,definitely one of the worst teachers had here she repeats herself and talks about herself the whole lecture the only way you learn is through your own hard work reading and the occasional film grading compared to content and lectures are very disproportional grade rides on tests and essay do it again
15984,Johnetta  Richards,this class was tough make sure you read every page of every bookor else attendance is mandatory to stay on top of things or else you will fall behind a tough grader but she is fair definitely need a class buddy to study with overall a cool teacher but dont think it will be an easy a you have to work for it
15985,Johnetta  Richards,if you wanna learn she will teach you
15986,Johnetta  Richards,truth and fact if you take dr richards class you better read the book comment and take notes dont come late and never ever ever ever ever use your cell phone over all her lessons are wonderful and her test are challenging but a real student can do it just do the work and you will get an a
15987,Pam  Hood,although this was an easy class prof pam occasionally went off topic throughout her lectures and was sometimes confusing to follow you have to show up to class just read the books and complete the online assignments online assignments are so just try to do them and get the easy points last daydonuts so
15988,Pam  Hood,funny pam hood loves making jokes to lighten up the learning atmosphere
15989,Pam  Hood,professor pam is a riot she is energetic in her lectures providing thorough explanations to make an interesting topic much more interesting i go to class the last two months and still got an a easy easy a you can learn a lot if you push yourself and do the expected work if you still get an a
15990,Pam  Hood,one of the coolest professors ever seen phil is not my thing but i took her phil101 for ge purposes her class does not have any exam including final there are about essays that are fairly easy they have deadlines but u can turn in anytime u want without getting any penalty she grades not hard too recommend to her class
15991,Pam  Hood,you dont even need to come to class i only came sometimes for the comfy seats there is no late policy for any of her work she doesnt believe in midterms or finals exams so thats a plus very easy if you put in some effort in her essays
15992,Pam  Hood,pretty chill teacher no late policy so just turn in assignments by last day of semester and you are set as for attendance leel whats that only went times difficulty of class easy for creative projects2 agora days just turn in and free for short essays actually put some effort into it and good
15993,Pam  Hood,pretty easy class as long as you actually put some thought into the essays and reports extremely nice and helpful professor attendance is not mandatory however she did take attendance daily lectures could be pretty boring but helpful when you understand the material all the lectures consisted of her explaining the reading
15994,Pam  Hood,sweet lady that loves her innout not into philosophy and this class made me not want to take interest in philosophy even more class was boring and i attend of the time except on test days passed with an a because i actually did a bit of reading for the tests and i took the assignments seriously
15995,Pam  Hood,professor hood loves her innout throughout the semester she used burgers and donuts and used them to make philosophical arguments which was pretty hilarious though her lectures dragged on and were most of the time boring i still learned some interesting stuff when i read the book and wrote the essays do your best on the tests and papers
15996,Pam  Hood,easy class readings are sometimes confusing but just do your best email her for any concerns or questions she is approachable overall do your best and it should be a chill class
15997,Pam  Hood,easy class if looking to boost your take her class it consisted of tests which are pretty straight forward questions are always welcomed and answered in a clear way great class overall the key to doing well is to not overthink things
15998,Pam  Hood,forget what the other bad reviews told you i just took her fall and she is really chill and funny if you take this class you will pass as long as you skip a lot of classes
15999,Pam  Hood,professor pam is the best super chill and easy class really nice there are no midterms or finals we did three essays and all the other work was just complete or incomplete i definitely recommend this class for everyone she lets us out early half the time seriously best class ever
16000,Pam  Hood,this class is ridiculously easy she goes over the readings in class so you really have to read all hw quiz dates and essays are listed on the syllabus she take attendance but showing up to class is the easiest way to pass the tests are easy too she allows you to make them up weeks after the initial date everything is easy
16001,Pam  Hood,very understanding and wants her class to pass she explains what is being read and discusses the chapters for a better understanding
16002,Pam  Hood,professor pam was super sweet and always really entertaining she kept us interested and was really relatable her papers were not difficult as long as you did some of the required readings plus she brought our class dozen doughnuts on our last day of class no finals in this class i would take another class with her for sure
16003,Pam  Hood,like most courses and professors you will only get as much out of this as you intend to if you really need help you need to ask and help will be given etc regarding personality professor hood is quirky and keeps things fresh to say the least drive and interest are key motivators to understand and do well because the material can be dense
16004,Pam  Hood,do not take her i took her because of the easy reviews however spring she took off suddenly to medical leave she misses class a lot so the school took action we got this new guy for a teacher who made the class quite difficult quizzes were more challenging as were the lengths of the essays a lot of the class did poorly on quizzes
16005,Pam  Hood,she cancelled class frequently but ended up giving all of her students it was a bit scary to not have any idea what my grade looked like until the end of the semester but there was hardly any work in the class
16006,Pam  Hood,spring incredibly easy lots of cancels skimmed the reading lecture was dry even when she tries to make it relatable with college kids in fact it gets near incomprehensible when she starts throwing in lingo that she perceives as current but what can you do when half the class looks like they even know how to write a decent paper
16007,Frank  Harvey,great presenter and allows students to get involved one of my favorite classes in my undergrad yet
16008,Frank  Harvey,for a level class this was brutal his powerpoints are just endless slides of paragraphs that make no freaking sense the exams are all essays or terms which he even list off so you basically have rummage through all of the slides and guess what may or may not be on the exam worst class ever taken a nice guy tho
16009,Frank  Harvey,the entire class is based on the midterm and the final exam you really have to do the readings until studying and theres no textbook so thats a bonus study hard for the exams and do fine he is incredibly intelligent take this class if looking for an easy mark
16010,Frank  Harvey,dr harvey is a brilliant professor and a compassionate one towards students the first professor i had that actually took time and effort to find online resources and material which was grade a quality for the course instead of getting us to spend on textbooks lecture slides are posted exams are heavy on material but can be done with study
16011,Frank  Harvey,harvey arrogant he is just extremely intelligent world politics is not a light subject and he expects that people are intelligent enough to see both sides of arguments loved his class he was super helpful when i emailed him a question and i believe my exams were marked very fairly the final was difficult
16012,Frank  Harvey,dr harvey was a fantastic professor passionate about the subject matter often made jokes which lightened up the fact that it was a longer class and was friendly when approached with questions great class great teacher hard material but strongly recommend to political science majorsminors also he posts all the readings online to save
16013,Frank  Harvey,he knows what he is talking about he is a very nice man he organize world politics very well though it was always unclear what we were supposed to have read for class and he assigned a ridiculous amout of reading it was mostly redundant and he did not elaborate on the subtleties between readings in class pointless readings
16014,Frank  Harvey,very intense and opinionated
16015,Frank  Harvey,proff harvey is knowledgeable in this subject but has trouble relaying that information without reading his slides word by word he does not post the slides until just before the exam there are two exams it and they are difficult you really really really need to study you cannot slide by in this class be prepared
16016,Frank  Harvey,if you think world politics are interesting this class will teach you otherwise hard to stay focused when read slides word for word with little to no discussion seems like rather be elsewhere a shame because you can tell a nice guy the marking is unfair a midterm and final you gauge understanding on two tests
16017,Frank  Harvey,have to go to class all the time although the marks are entirely exam based which kind of sucks he seemed like rather be somewhere else than teaching students helpful and open to criticism
16018,Frank  Harvey,ah he was a nice guy who is definitely passionate about the subject approachable content was challenging which mix that great with the marking system midterm exam but i walk away liking it you know he even said thanks once when i held the door open for him which is more than i can say about other profs p
16019,Frank  Harvey,clearly would rather be doing his own research than condescending to teach very opinionated and not tolerant of other opinions assigns his own articles for readings lectures are deadly boring does decent prep before midterm final but the tas marked pretty tough
16020,Frank  Harvey,great guy brilliant too easy to approach and good insight a genuine care for students make sure you do the required readings want you to name names and events more than just theory at this stage work hard and get a good mark be satisfied
16021,Frank  Harvey,a passionate prof i could see how lectures could be dry if you were on fb the entire time instead of listening listen he has stuff to say he wants to know whether or not the class agrees with his open to controversy same with his exams if you work hard you will be satisfied with harvey
16022,Frank  Harvey,this class would be absolutely fantastic if it was smaller people in a class with an overwhelming amount of theories and case studies accomplish much i feel like i came out a bit emptyhanded watch out for his exams they definitely overcompensate for lack of any all year
16023,Frank  Harvey,really nice guy who wants to be helpful and engaging but always successful it was massive class he crammed way too much information with no tutorials or assignments to help you along halfway the grade is split between the midterm and final exams overall a frustrating class disappointing considering the topics are very interesting
16024,Frank  Harvey,you can tell he is a really nice guy and very passionate about what he teaches his lectures can be dull but he is extremely accomplished in his field so it is overall a pretty good class despite the difficult subject matter
16025,Frank  Harvey,worst class ever stay far away from world poly sci class his lectures do not help you at all he has the worst reader ever made it is soo borning and will costs alot of if you like borning profs who make you read boring expensive readers inorder to even pass the class harvey is your man stay far away from harvy and this class
16026,Frank  Harvey,he was an interesting prof i loved his lectures but if you keep up with the reading you were in trouble the marking very fair because it was in such big chunks but he was still one of my fav profs this past semester even though i got one of my worst marks in his class and he also brought in the most amazing guest speakers
16027,Sidney  Burks,csusb ects program online class no tests or quizzes follow directions turn in all assignments participate in peer feedback and earn this easy a
16028,Sidney  Burks,nice experienced professor always available for help either in email phone or in person great feedback on assignments i would recommend him
16029,Sidney  Burks,no comments
16030,Sidney  Burks,his class was so easy i passed with and he even asked me to be his student helper he was funny and a good teacher i would recommend him as a teacher
16031,Sidney  Burks,he is a good teacher and the class is very easy if you know anything about cars this class will be a breeze its cool that you get to use all the tools and lifts to work on your own car pay attention and you will be fine
16032,Glanville,dr glanville is the best the complaints listed here make sense only if you are not interested in doing philosophy in a rigorous and fulfilling way if you have a chance to take him do it
16033,Glanville,i got an a it was so easy i wanted to die take this guy
16034,Glanville,incredibly erudite he has profound amount of knowledge in his head but he was too slow in lecturing and kinda old he used wolfgang behm as an assistant i talked him after class alot that guy knows his plato and medieval philosophy like nobodys business and really helped cement what glanville was saying get wolfgang not glanville
16035,Glanville,ignore recommendations if you take him be sure you can drop the class want to he is an extremely intelligent man but we never once covered more than the first item on the board interesting but not acceptable he is so quiet you can barely hear him this man should teach privately he just does not fit in the academic environment
16036,Glanville,i feel sorry for the man but i mean come on its time to retire because the entire class understand what saying gradings not too hard easy reading boring as hell teacher
16037,Glanville,he is a brilliant there is an amazing amount of information in this head however he is nitpicky about stupid things we read the bible the entire semester but it was an easy a
16038,Glanville,awful just awful
16039,Glanville,this guy be a teacher anymore
16040,Glanville,be advised he will yell at you for shaking your leg for looking out a window for chewing gum almost anything very old and has seriously lost it do not take
16041,Glanville,hard to understand very old and cantankerous i even like boring philosophy by most standards very arbitrary and could hardly put together sentences at times avoid at all costs
16042,Glanville,no comments
16043,Glanville,very straightforward professor keeps you interested with the history of greek philosophy requires only a short midterm and a short final show respect and respect you
16044,Glanville,too critical of habits and at times a bit despotic but overall he is an excellent professor
16045,Glanville,this guy is soo blunt that if you are wrong he will tear you up he is a great teach and make sure you are on time or else you will get a grade scolding
16046,Glanville,i cannot respect anyone who like glanville he is one of the best professors i have ever had he is thorough clear knowledgable fair demanding if you are a serious student who enjoys rigorous learning and not some whiney idiot who wants to be pandered to you will love this professor
16047,Glanville,this guys is so passionate about ancient philosphy that he wishes he lived in ancient greece make sure you come to class on time or he will get angry all you have to do in that class is pay attention take notes and do take home tests
16048,Glanville,this teacher is so boring it sucks that i had to take him as a night class teacher all he does is repeat himself and read from the book soo boring
16049,Glanville,if you are a philo major you should take him he has it down like a math equation especially greeks thoug somewhat westernized greeks and lets be fair what do u expect from an old guy talk to him in person and you will learn much more after all he is almost a retired prof
16050,Glanville,i just could not keep from falling asleep extremely dull he does harldy anything but read from the book
16051,Glanville,i can see how a disengaged student filling requirements might be bored critical thinking be terribly exciting to teach to students either if you are interested in philosophy and want to study with a deep imaginative and methodical professor your man
16052,Joann  Eisberg,i love this professor she is passionate about the subject and tries her best to get you interested as well tests are easy quizes everyweek but you can use your notes there is alot of homework but they count alot for your grade take her you wont regret it the sweetest prof at chaffey
16053,Joann  Eisberg,a great teacher and i recommend this teacher for anyone who is going to take astronomy
16054,Joann  Eisberg,one of the easiest classes i have ever taken i know how anyone ended up with less than an a in this class really do all the work and show up to class and you get an a study for exams they are very easy too she is super smart and a harvard alumni even though she never mentioned it because she is super humble amazing professor
16055,Joann  Eisberg,eisberg is amazing very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help she tends to ramble though spend minutes answering a yes or no question but take her again as long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes pass and a few extra credit opportunities
16056,Joann  Eisberg,professor eisberg is a great professor super enthusiastic about astronomy and very helpful there is homework pretty much every week you should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to that basically twice the length of the online lecture lots of assignments but easy and are all completed in class
16057,Joann  Eisberg,i took her for a fasttrack class it was worth it but expect to put in work for your grade she makes you do powerpoints at home and then the next day in class she relectures you on what you learned last night and its very boring you need to show up to class because right after lectures you do a lab or learn an astronomical equation for tests
16058,Joann  Eisberg,eisberg is awesome hardest class taken but so incredibly worth it she is passionate about what she teaches she is there for assistance if you need it she wants to help the students i loved the content i would totally recommend her
16059,Joann  Eisberg,joann is great she really wants all her students to succeed and is always available to help you out if you have any questions she taught a flipped instruction course which required a lot of studyingonline lectures for homework but her lectures class activities always make the material easy to understand love her
16060,Joann  Eisberg,lots of physics involved not a mathematical genius so this class and the were slightly confusing at times overall a good class though i really received the help i needed when i needed it i would recommend her
16061,Joann  Eisberg,she is a wonderful person and i love her super sweet and willing to help you in any way the class was fairly easy my only problem with her is that she is easily distracted and loves to ramble on she will spend half of the class talking about something completely unrelated to what we are supposed to be learning
16062,Joann  Eisberg,very passionate about astronomy if you have a question she will answer it in a way that is fun and easy to understand large homework assignments that she will guide you on how to do it a lot of calculations but it is gone over a lot before you do it on your own easy exams lots of extra credit opportunities
16063,Joann  Eisberg,joann is awesome hilarious quirky and passionate i would say this there is a lot of material covered but she only tests you on a quarter of it follow the notes provided in the syllabus and be golden on hw and tests also if lazy or too special ed to do fractions then skip this class and take earth science or something
16064,Joann  Eisberg,i definitely agree about her voice it was like nails on chalkboard to me a nice lady but you can tell she astronomy so much that her social skills took a back seat she would ramble on and on about the easiest topic leaving us to figure out the harder stuff ourselves she nitpicks to the smallest detail on the homework
16065,Joann  Eisberg,i have mixed feelings about this class not so much the professor eisberg is good nice lady helpful i am not a science person so i thought this would be a better option then bio or chem but this class was still difficult big hw assignments tests are short but worth a lot of points and in depth professor good class soso
16066,Joann  Eisberg,i took this class because i was looking for an easy a and it was all that was left to enroll in.but the class work is difficult but if you ask for help she does and makes it so darn easy once she does.and even gave me a interest in the planets that im always staring in the sky saying oh this is what she was talking about.i liked her
16067,Joann  Eisberg,oh man i know how she got such good ratings her voice makes you want to hurt things every seen mrs doubtfire like a mix of that and julia child makes it hard to focus and i think she does it on purpose i mean to be hateful but you need the facts take her definitely i even got a b and sayin this
16068,Joann  Eisberg,sweet lady very positive loves astronomy moderately difficult course but simple if you just show up and keep up with assignments
16069,Joann  Eisberg,just an amazing professor loves her work and is very passionate about the history of our universe and will help in and out of class until you understand she explains the material througouly makes it fun for everyone and will not give you a day without making you smile
16070,Joann  Eisberg,professor eisberg is obviously in love with astronomy is very passionate about teaching it she loves sharing her knowledge she is very quirky keeps things interesting even though we had a class it was never a drag to go this was a great lab class i would highly recommend it
16071,Joann  Eisberg,professor eisberg is a great professor sweet nice and a little quirky genuinly interested in astronomy which got me interested in it if you need a class with a lab this is a great one to take
16072,Maria  Fitzpatrick,really enjoyed her online class you know what is expected of you each week and you have opportunities to work ahead the course material was very interesting and overall i am glad i got her as a professor
16073,Maria  Fitzpatrick,easy a so easy i learn much participate and get an a
16074,Maria  Fitzpatrick,maria was the sweetest professor i have ever had she was super flexible and understands that life happens sometimes sometimes was not super clear about criteria but was fairly assessable outside of the classroom absolutely adored her and wished i done with my psych requirements to take more classes with her i took her at the rcc campus
16075,Maria  Fitzpatrick,great wants you to succeed will help you if you ask for extra credit very good lectures and good study guides followed her for my bio major prereqs she likes you to be involved in discussion on the topics on the subjects of the day love the team group testing gives the chance to build up grade best teach ever for psych
16076,Maria  Fitzpatrick,great professor must rent textbook to receive participation points on the online discussions participation grade weighs a lot she likes to know you are reading the assignments and quoting from the actual book she does offer extra credit via essay only need to write essays for online class apa style great at replying back to emails
16077,Maria  Fitzpatrick,took this class online and it was an easy a if anyone a psych major and wishes to just knock this class out of the way i would recommend taking online it saved me alot of time all you need to do is reply to these forums once a week and you had papers due throughout the whole semester and they were easy she responds fast to emails
16078,Maria  Fitzpatrick,i love mrs fitzpatrick psych very caring a bit of a calling in sick but if you voice your concerns to her she will help you pick up grade funny her tests do match her exams a lot of reading she lets you use a cheat sheet on test easy a very accessible on line and in office overall very relaxed happy all the time
16079,Maria  Fitzpatrick,grades papers kind of hard lots of group work such a big class the students screwed around so much that you could never hear the lecture at some point you need to tell the class to quiet down some of us were actually there to learn she was often in her own little world really seem to care about what she teaches
16080,Maria  Fitzpatrick,fitzpatrick is a total valley girl that sounds like she has a grade education class was really boring watched old movies from the that teach us anything had to write several papers a stickler for apa format overrated if you ask me
16081,Maria  Fitzpatrick,too many papers respond to emails often late to class not sure i even learned anything
16082,Maria  Fitzpatrick,very part of our grade is visiting her during her office hours she said that if we have any that we still needed to show up to say hi she also let the class decide when papers will be due after giving suggested dates after an hour of everyone arguing we ended up dates as orig more papers than english class
16083,Maria  Fitzpatrick,most lectures are half lecture half movie not very specific on what you need to be paying attention to beware she will not reply back to your emails feedback for our research paper rough draft was given back to us days before the final draft was due she makes you take all the tests twice for a chance to do better but its not worth it
16084,Maria  Fitzpatrick,several small papers required and a final page apa style research paper her exams cover a lot of material but she works with you to get a better grade
16085,Maria  Fitzpatrick,if trying to just finish your ge classes get easy a i would def take professor fitzpatrick but if you actually want to learn psychology i would prob take someone else anyways i took this course online and it was super easy saved me lots of time quizzes are untimed and you just have to keep up with the weekly forums shes so awesome
16086,Maria  Fitzpatrick,she took over the half of my socialpsych class i had her for intro to psych and it was a waste of time her classes are why millenials think owed something write all your answers on her allowed cheat sheets and do assignments and you get an if felt like an insult to the students who actually want to be challenged and earn grades
16087,Maria  Fitzpatrick,her lecture is really boring she use a lot of boring video long long time ago information she offer a lot extra credit if you did them you will get a good grade it is hard to learning something through her lecture
16088,Maria  Fitzpatrick,her online psych class was the easiest class ever taken her quizzes timed and you have all semester for homework assignments definitely recommend this class if you are working full time and really have time for homework
16089,Maria  Fitzpatrick,professor fitzpatrick is awesome and really pretty she really knows her stuff for all of her psych classes she emails fast and answers all of your questions i definitely recommend taking her for all of your psych classes
16090,Maria  Fitzpatrick,one of the best classes taken i took this class online over the summer there are weekly forum posts and quizzes one final and two papers she is easy to talk to and is always willing to help there was a lot of reading but it was easy reading cause it is all very interesting take her you regret it
16091,Maria  Fitzpatrick,a great professor and her class is interesting she offers a cheat sheet for every exam only because her tests are pretty difficult she is a fair grader however she takes apa format very serious if you make any mistakes on an apa format assignment she will take many points off other than that very clear offers extra credit
16092,Wendy  Maleki,this teacher definitely chooses her favorites but seems to pick on those who stand out in either good or bad ways she enjoys being the one who knows more so challenge her just keep your head down and your mouth closed and do fine
16093,Wendy  Maleki,took ms maleki for cna tough if you want to be a nurse take anyone but if you want to an excellent nurse take her she does pick favorites and will snap on you just blend in and stand out and just learn what she has to pass on to you
16094,Wendy  Maleki,she is strict but she will help you if you ask she always has help material in her office if you are struggling with a topic she is willing to do what she can to help her students she tends to use other resources that are not required text but it is to benefit the students learning she has high expectations both of her teaching and her student
16095,Wendy  Maleki,be careful she has her favorites notsofavorites moody tests are unfair if she makes a grading error on your exam you must challenge it in writing even though it was her mistake stay away from her at all costs
16096,Wendy  Maleki,this teacher has high expectations of students but moreover has to be right all of the time careful what you say regarding disagreeing as it will bite you in the end try not to stand out she likes to be the one who shines she is very calucating
16097,Wendy  Maleki,unfair standards singles people out and picks at them setting them up for failure difficult to comprehend what she is asking for
16098,Wendy  Maleki,not recommended her at all so strict teacher
16099,Wendy  Maleki,study study study she expects you to know everything mrs maleki is great i would take her over again if she taught another class she makes you learn and understand funny and down to earth write you up even if she likes you she treats everyone the same when grading and while in clinical great
16100,Wendy  Maleki,this professor definatly shows favoritism blatently if you do not agree with her may i suggest you bite your tongue she will earmark you for failure and never let you live it down she is very scattered in her lectures and pulls test questions out of thin air then she marks answers wrong on the test when the book says the answer is correct
16101,Wendy  Maleki,no comments
16102,Wendy  Maleki,mrs maleki is a very nice lady she is strict but she will do what she can to help you she just took over as being the director of the vn program and when she did she totally turned it around for the better i am very greatful thank you mrs maleki
16103,Wendy  Maleki,great teacher kindda strict but very helpful i recomend taking her classes

16109,Robert  Rundquist,no comments
16110,Sara  Seol,mrs seol was my favorate instructor in the vn program she teaches both lecture and clinical her tests are difficult but they are in line with her lectures she is very encouraging i loved her and would recommend her to anyone thank you mrs seol
16111,Sariwan  Tjandra,dr tjandra is a very smart professor he definatley provides you the recourses to well in his class practice the hw problems as many times as possible and focus on the material he emphasizes in lecture dont fall behind because it will punch you in the face the deeper you get into the course he drops lowest test and has weekly quizzes
16112,Sariwan  Tjandra,professor tjandra was great he explains everything thoroughly and in an easy way to try to remember it is a lot of work includes homework assignments exercise worksheets quizzes tests and lab work i however did not put my full effort so i will probably be failing the class but will retake him soon after because he really is great
16113,Sariwan  Tjandra,i had absolutely no chemistry background but professor tjandra gives really good examples so the material is understandable there is a lot of work for this class but good practice for the test
16114,Sariwan  Tjandra,professor tjandra is amazing i never thought i would be so intrigued by chemistry he really had me enjoy coming to class which is a first he definitely wants to make sure you understand everything and uses great examples take him
16115,Sariwan  Tjandra,if your going to take chemistry you have to take tjandra he prepares you for everything it is very clear he wants you to pass take him you be disappointed
16116,Sariwan  Tjandra,he was the first science professor i had at chaffey college he was amazing i had never taken chemistry previously and i passed his class with an a he gives lots of hand outs that really help with understanding and does a lot of in class activities i would recommend him i wish he tought and
16117,Sariwan  Tjandra,great lectures very friendly and ready to help as said below if your study your homework and notes well then do well on his tests he gives out exercise worksheets to make sure you know the math parts of chem
16118,Sariwan  Tjandra,excellent professor makes chemistry very simple to understand say more just an awesome professor textbook is only used for homework
16119,Sariwan  Tjandra,dr tjandra is the best chemistry professor i have ever taken his lectures are very good he uses a combination of powerpoint and boardwork to explain his topics and he does this very well his tests are tough and the lab reports are long so make sure that you are studying and have the time set apart for this class super timeconsuming
16120,Sariwan  Tjandra,i loved this professor his way of teaching his notes are very helpful would take him again especially if taken other professor for same class see the difference passed his class with a without any tutoringgroup studyingreading book so if you try a little more then i did sure get an do just fine
16121,Sariwan  Tjandra,if you plan on going further into chemistry definitely take tjandra best chem teacher ever class is easy because he is determined to help you understand however even intro to chem gets a little complicated so listen to the man and do your work
16122,Sariwan  Tjandra,wonderful wonderful wonderful i never took chemistry before and was rather afraid because i was unfamiliar with it he made it so fun and understandable and was always there to help he also offers a great amount of extra credit but he give you challenge also and makes sure you know the subject love this professor
16123,Sariwan  Tjandra,tjandra is really helpful to his student loved his class i have a really hard time with chemistry but mr tjandra made it so understanding and easy its not hard to pass his class if you do all the hw and exercises he gives you also you need to study overall his class is the best wish all science teachers were like him
16124,Sariwan  Tjandra,he is such a sweetheart ha ha he really wants to help you guys succeed you can tell by his actions it is kind of adorable how he tries to tie in science jokes in class to ease everyone up and try to make things fun take it easy study frequently and do you homework if you miss those you will lose valuable points good luck
16125,Sariwan  Tjandra,i had dr tjandra for chem and he is the best professor had ever he genuinely cares for his students and their success chemistry is a tough subject but he really tries and makes it understandable to his students do your homework carefully take careful notes and go to his office hours and do fine the best
16126,Sariwan  Tjandra,dr tjandra is amazing he is so helpful and really wants the students to succeed he cares about what he does and furthermore he is super intelligent he really goes the extra mile for his students excellent choice
16127,Sariwan  Tjandra,tjandra is an amazing teacher before taking his class i was so intimidated with chemistry tjandra really knows how to teach and offers as much help as you need to help you understand miss a class or hw and you will do well memorize everything he says to in the beginning and towards the end everything will just fall into place
16128,Sariwan  Tjandra,love love love this class once you understand all the elements the class is so easy loved how dr tjandra reached he is really helpful i would highly recommend this class
16129,Sariwan  Tjandra,took dr tjandra for chem ans plan on taking him again to hes a great professor he gives good examples and makes it easy to understand chemistry are straight from the hw exams are pretty difficult but you will do good if you study the hw and class notes finals not bad though lab is just lab pretty easy if you read ahead
16130,Sariwan  Tjandra,he is great he gives plenty of examples and really wants you to succeed just go to all the lectures and keep up with hw and you be surprised on the tests i wish he taught more classed because probably the best prof had at chaffey he has an accent but easy to understand overall take him
16131,Laura  Newhart,the modules due each week take at least an hour or more to complete we have online group work in which she expected us to email each other our work back and forth there is a page term paper at the end which is essentially your final and oh yeah she wrote the book so if you word for word repeat the book your answer wrong
16132,Laura  Newhart,take this class i took this as my writing intensive course and was that a mistake the online site was impossible to navigate the tests are timed an hour and a half and had i not had someone send me the questions beforehand it would be impossible for me to finish them in time it took me four hours to answer all the or questions cont
16133,Laura  Newhart,lots of reading followed by class discussion over material you know ahead of time exactly what is expected for assignments so if you want to actually learn and participate in class do the reading if not do the readings when the assigned papers are due with the least bit of effort you can get a great grade she is lecture heavy
16134,Laura  Newhart,need to show up to class she gives random participation days and takes attendance every day reports are easy as long as you skim the material
16135,Laura  Newhart,i absolutely loved this class i showed up for every class session you have to unless you have a friend who is willing to give you the notes since she does not post powerpoints online she goes in depth and you actually learn the subject matter the tests are literally based on the notes and questions from the study guide overall she is great
16136,Laura  Newhart,she seemed a little nutty at times but super caring and sweet i pay attention in her class and still managed to get an a
16137,Laura  Newhart,i loved mrs newhart was a part philosophy part service learning class focused on teaching children philosophy but it was incredibly easy i read none of the material but showed up passed with an easy a some failed the first test so the rest were take home essays i interested in the material but i would recommend this class
16138,Laura  Newhart,super sweet lady but be prepared her slides are not posted on blackboard nothing is and the slides are really the entire book put on power point if pressured for time she gives a study guide for the exams but its just as long as her power points she is very mum on what to expect for exams i feel im going in to it exams blind
16139,Laura  Newhart,dr newhart is kind of spacey but she is a very helpful professor this class requires a lot of work but she is nice and very friendly
16140,Laura  Newhart,difficult subject but i somehow managed to get an a she is nice but gets mad if you talk in class she will help you any way she can attendance is only mandatory in that if you show up you have a clue what is going on the textbook is very helpful the only assignments are exams and term paper
16141,Laura  Newhart,i really like professor newhart she does talk quite a bit but overall i really liked her class i have never taken a philosophy class so some of the material was hard to understand you do have to write a lot in class and she always gives you good feedback on your papers i liked her
16142,Laura  Newhart,took course with newhart and only passed by two points while learning nothing retook course with parchment and aced it while learning alot newhart tons of homework parchment no homework conclusion take parchment
16143,Laura  Newhart,she talks to fast she doesnt help her class is boring as heck and i just dislike her class in general the material is not very hard but the way she teaches it the book is all that you are using to learn from
16144,Laura  Newhart,newhart is not my favorite professor it may be because i quite enjoy aristotle and plato however been taught plato before and found him interesting so i think more because she herself is not particularly interesting nice enough and everything but when she teaches the class is pretty boring to say the least
16145,Laura  Newhart,she was a very good teacher and super nice have presentations or tests you had to write papers but they were all very easy to write
16146,Laura  Newhart,dr newhart is a wonderful lady but this course is a bore a lot of busy work and class can get boring very fast she is a sweet lady though and sometimes can be fun she laughs about everything a lot of class participation but none of the material is that hard to grasp if you do the homework or at least some of it
16147,Laura  Newhart,i am not a fan of dr newhart at all as interested as she is in philosophy and as knowlegeable as she is about the subject she does not know how to express it to her students without giggling a lot at her own jokes i have to take notes hardcore when she teaches because her lectures do not sink in at all
16148,Laura  Newhart,newhart is crazy the only woman i know that can say um and ya know forty seven time straight class is boring but a breeze
16149,Laura  Newhart,dr newhart is a hoot she makes class so interesting helps you learn in many aspects so a tricky subject is very understandable very easy grading on all work and will tell you where you need to improve easy to talk to very understanding lady plenty of energy but fun
16150,Laura  Newhart,easy class as long as you dont mind to write about page papers and big papers no tests or homework other than the papers shes def out there though dont count on learning anything in class shes in her own world
16151,Laura  Prividera,priverida has strong teaching skills but she is a hard gradernot bad to look at either
16152,Laura  Prividera,really good teacher provides many different points of view and life experience examples when possible always cheerful i wish more professors were like her tests are pretty easy if you read and do the study guide i would recommend dr.prividera to any one majoring in communication
16153,Laura  Prividera,she is ok as teacher nothing great i did hate dgoing to class because she is fake you can tell by the tone of her voice when she speaks its a put on she also needs to realize that comm is a required course and not everyones major so comm is not my life chem is a little more important tan comm to some people
16154,Laura  Prividera,she is a really great teacher and is one of the few profs i have had thats relates to students well she is very understanding and will give you test questions on a regular basis if you go to class i would strongly suggest her she does a good job at making class interesting and making the material understandable
16155,Laura  Prividera,i can go ahead and say she is a very good teacher but for the gender comm class i would not recommend taking her she is so pro women it makes taking her class as a male akward and disheartend one would think a class on gender bias wouldnt be so centered on making everyone think the world is out to get women the text book is awful
16156,Laura  Prividera,it would be nice if she stopped talking about her self and teach for a little while how many times do we have to hear about how many awards she has won
16157,Laura  Prividera,had a lot of professors but i can confidently say that dr prividera is one of the most exceptional instructors ever known you will learn you will not be bored you will look forward to class and you will get the grade you deserve if they were all like her never want to graduate
16158,Laura  Prividera,she is amazing if you come to class and take the notes the three tests will not be a problem she does a great job of making this class interesting she seems very passionate about what she teaches which is a huge plus you wanna listen to professor who care about what they teach right
16159,Laura  Prividera,dr priv is good she is very outgoing a little loud sometimes but she is a fun teacher she tries to learn your name even though a huge class which by the way makes people a little more shy than usual
16160,Laura  Prividera,dr prividera is my absolute favorite professor here even smiling as i type this so helpful attendance is a must because she place the powerpoints online take tedious notes and study everything and good ask questions about the study guides if unclear it pays off later
16161,Laura  Prividera,professor prividera is a fantastic teacher she answers all your questions before you ever ask very thorough the class was very interesting the topics discussed were easy to relate to there are exams which are straight from the notes she gives lots of examples to help you understand pay attention study sure to get an a
16162,Laura  Prividera,great teacher really knows her stuff very energetic and seems genuinely happy to be teaching communication if you go to class and take notes the exams should be no problem and she sends out studying guides she gives you chances to ask questions and talk to her about things you dont understand i definately recommend her
16163,Laura  Prividera,great teacher very energetic she only has tests but good if you come to class and pay attention and take notes be fine
16164,Laura  Prividera,best teacher ever had in my life excellent energy and its not a difficult class highly recommendseriously a great professor
16165,Laura  Prividera,excellent professor and if u come to class you will do fine
16166,Laura  Prividera,no comments
16167,Laura  Prividera,i like this class and the open forum
16168,Laura  Prividera,i did not care for her and i feel that she did not care for me or my ideas some people like her but i bet she liked them as well i never did anything to her to deserve a c in her esy class i turned in everything and i was nearly always there for class just wast your time
16169,Laura  Prividera,awesome teacher definitely one of my favorite teachers in the comm department very interesting class the discussions are great dr privedera is very intelligent tests easy but she gives you a study guide definitely take this class with her
16170,Laura  Prividera,fun class she has a lot of energy and a lot to say she is very intellegent and enjoys talking to students i interviewed her for a project in another class and she spend several hours chatting with me about her feminist views which really helped me out and had nothing to do with her own class
16171,Paul  Ryan,very confusing man seem familiar with the topics or how to explain them overall not a great instructor for electrotech
16172,Paul  Ryan,no comments
16173,Johannes  Van Biesebroeck,haha best name fun course and good prof too i guess
16174,Johannes  Van Biesebroeck,good and hot prof nice guy from stanford
16175,Johannes  Van Biesebroeck,he is really nice prof he is really helpful all the time he is cool
16176,Ian  Spears,professor spears is not the easiest marker and i will not be receiving an extremely high mark in his class but he is caring passionate and insightful he loves the material he teaches and loves to discuss it the essay was super fun to write the class needs a lot of time devoted to readings though overall would take again
16177,Ian  Spears,prof spears is by far the best i have had in my entire university experience he was always so excited to start the lecture and actually cares about what he is teaching students taken two classes with him already and plan on taking any more that i can in my last year highly recommend taking any class he teaches
16178,Ian  Spears,hilarious that people complain about the amount of readings in a full credit course what did u expect gives away of ur mark in weekly much less writing than other full essays pages total tough marker for essays but fair gives good feedback great course fav learned a lot
16179,Ian  Spears,did not enjoy the lectures they were clear but i feel that he spent too much time on every idea thus we ran out of time occasionally and it could get boring he can call on students at random so be aware of being put on the spot instructions for our essay were very openended and this made it much more difficult he is a nice guy though for sure
16180,Ian  Spears,he is a very tough prof probably the toughest i have ever had but he is by far my favorite he is a hard marker for essays and has high expectations but it makes you a better student he is great to just chat with about issues in class overall amazing guy totally possible to get if you hustle all year
16181,Ian  Spears,one of the best professors truly an educator he makes your standards of other go higher he cares for your learning success intelligent funny approachable and he makes you think not for lazy people obviously welcome to university one of those that changes people lives for the better take his courses
16182,Ian  Spears,a great guy just impossible to get in class average will be around a low no matter what you will get no higher than a on the term paper an amazing lecturer it final is extremely difficult too
16183,Ian  Spears,ridiculous amount of readings for a fourth year class it seems like its a masters class but isnt i barely got a because it was so damn difficult to keep up hes a really nice guy but marks really hard and expects too much
16184,Ian  Spears,absolutely ridiculous class pages of reading per week and the professor marks incredibly difficult hes a nice guy and you learn a lot but do not expect a
16185,Ian  Spears,spears was an amazing prof he genuinely cares about the students and tries to remember the names of all of the students in order to develop a more personal relationship go out of his way to help you and definitely makes lectures interesting always up for a discussion during class which allows students to gain more knowledge
16186,Ian  Spears,hour seminar quiz every class pages of tough marker that all being said it was genuinely a privilege to be in ian spears year class it is the most eye opening provocative and inspirational course at guelph he cares about his students and wants them to think critically about every reading take this class
16187,Ian  Spears,ian speers is a amazing prof the reason considering to be politics prof in future really inspiring and helpful in class however he encourages to read and attend to classes a lot so if not interested you might have a hard time
16188,Ian  Spears,spears is a really great prof his course is very focused on the readings but he lectures very well and is really funny
16189,Ian  Spears,spears is one of those profs that has an almost legendary reputation among students incredibly engaging friendly intelligent and helpful his classes are not easy the readings are fairly long but interesting he expects highquality essays and his examinations require thorough knowledge of all the readings and yet still love it
16190,Ian  Spears,my favourite prof makes lectures interesting always there for his students helpful approachable wants you to learn grow presents contrasting arguments to really make you think no textbook content can be challenging so you have to make effort i like that he encourages class discussion but sometimes he lets people drone on for too long
16191,Ian  Spears,one of my favourite professors at guelph he truly makes lectures enjoyable to attend i believe he is an extremely fair marker and creates good exams but his classes are not easy
16192,Ian  Spears,best prof i have ever had hands down
16193,Ian  Spears,spears is amazing super passionate about what he does and encourages each pupil to have their own opinion really values your participation in class and likes to show you all perspectives in order to equip you for the actual world where there is no one answer to anything absolute favourite prof at uofg
16194,Ian  Spears,many call him ian the ratface spears
16195,Ian  Spears,fantastic professor cares about his students our success making us think was incredibly understanding when i needed extensions and the amount i learned in his class astounds me lectures mostly coincide with the textbook great at teaching so you can get good marks do your readings take good notes come to class you can get an a
16196,S.  Liang,text sucked for this course.but the professor is extremely helpful.he is not the best lecturer but if you go upto him he explains really well.he is a very nice guy
16197,S.  Liang,i find it ironic that the people criticizing his english skills also happen to have had the most problems posting a coherent comment for this prof the irony is delicious that is if it you get it
16198,S.  Liang,he gave us great midterm and final exams thank him great professor
16199,S.  Liang,an excellent professor great teaching method great explaination great mark giving method everybody taking his class will like he will be the superstar in york be proud of him
16200,S.  Liang,he is so nice especially he gives us the nicest strategy in marks he is humerous helpful and kind in class teaching he can be one of the top professor in the year to come
16201,S.  Liang,his math is very excellent nobody can challenge him
16202,S.  Liang,hey needs some english lessions the sad part is his only first year prof so be around for awhile

16217,Andrea  O\'Bryan,i had her for math in college but i did in high school never had a teacher who went so far out of her way to help students as she did i sucked at math and she was infinitely patient one of my favorite teachers period
16218,Andrea  O\'Bryan,good teacher very sweet and she honestly cares about her students i think the bad ratings come from people who come in with a predisposition against math and thusly take it out on her
16219,Andrea  O\'Bryan,no comment
16220,Andrea  O\'Bryan,mrs is a good teacher he tests to hard and she is very helpful when needed everybody that like her know crap about math and that is why they are failing if you know anything about math she is the woman to take

16233,Gay  Sweely,she is the best professor and one of the most lovely human beings i have ever met
16234,Gay  Sweely,wonderful professor she loves what she does and she understands that this class essential for your career all you have to do is write two short easy papers a powerpoint presentation midterm and final the can be difficult if not good at memorizing but east a
16235,Gay  Sweely,she is probably the nicest professor you will ever have if you need an easy a for your arts humanities credit this is the class and professor for you
16236,Gay  Sweely,she is sweet love her class and care about her student easy to get an a
16237,Gay  Sweely,loved this class lectures were boring sometimes but it was an interesting class gay really loves teaching it she will repeat that a lot it is an easy class not many assignments and the exams are all memorization would recommend easy a
16238,Gay  Sweely,loved dr sweely she is awesome not a hard class and she gives study guides for test she keeps the class interesting even if you are not into art and there was not many assignments i would defiantly take her again sweetest lady ever
16239,Gay  Sweely,she is the best she is easy and funny it s really easy to get an a in this class there are homework in this class and one project they r easy to do there r tests and she gives u the study guide for them i highly recommend her
16240,Gay  Sweely,although the tests are tough she is usually pretty generous with grading in the end if you participate and show up to class she is quite hilarious and tries to make the subject as painless as possible
16241,Gay  Sweely,i have never had a professor care as much as dr sweely she genuinely cares about her students you have to take her as a teacher
16242,Gay  Sweely,best professor ever she really cares about her students and art
16243,Timothy  McCauley,professor mccauley is the best professor i have had york he posts his powerpoints which makes it easy when studying for the mid term and the final after taking this class with him i switched my major to sociology if you have a chance to take a clas with him take it he is knowledgeable and definitely knows what he is talking about
16244,Timothy  McCauley,worst prof ever had in years at york believe me i studied i went to every class lecture i even went to the writing department for help and i still managed to get a c on my papers very unfair everyone gets the same presentation mark stay far away if you want to pass great course he just taught nothing to do with the course
16245,Timothy  McCauley,dr class was interesting i learn a lot about society and social issues
16246,Timothy  McCauley,very disorganized professor he has yet to embrace the century his lectures consist of him sitting there and spewing notes with no direction as if he is reading a wikipedia page not very clear or concise either not a very good speaker he does not tell you what expecting on assignments and does not respond to emails
16247,Timothy  McCauley,prof mccauley got straight to the point during his lectures never went off topic he was a pretty understanding prof although it always seemed like he was in a rush to leave class the class was usually very quiet so he would always end class early pretty easy marker always takes attendance but can sometimes be intimidating overall good prof
16248,Timothy  McCauley,he takes attendance at the beginning of each lecture his lectures are not long and they are very clear he posts them on his website so you have to go crazy jotting down everything his exams come from the slides usually a few mc concepts and an essay q he is a fair marker there is also a essay he is also very understanding
16249,Timothy  McCauley,dr.mccauley is one of my favorite professor at york very easy to approach and his teaching is very clear all tests or exams are based on the powerpoint study the lecture slides on his website and attend lectures regularly you will definitely do well in this course prof mccauley made sociological theories more interesting
16250,Timothy  McCauley,good proof gets straight to the point know what he s talking about
16251,Timothy  McCauley,absolutely wonderful teacher very knowledgable essay essay very sweet prof
16252,Timothy  McCauley,he is a solid grounded and very practical prof he simplifies the content and is quite fair one does need to put some work into this course
16253,Timothy  McCauley,some of the material he teaches is outdated this was a race and ethnicity class so i was hoping to learn a lot about various ethnic groups however we spent a lot of time learning of his study on french and english relations instead midterm was easy but the course overall was unevenly distributed with too much weight on one paper
16254,Timothy  McCauley,i think prof mccauley is an awesome teacher he is easy to understand and he makes sociology interesting i plan to take more courses with him in the futue
16255,Timothy  McCauley,this prof seems disengaged and bored when he lectures he can also be quite blunt and intimidating short tests paper and i would not recommend this course to anyone unless they are knowledgeable on religions
16256,Timothy  McCauley,disorganized his lecture slides are all over the place but very understanding in terms of deadlines
16257,Timothy  McCauley,i had no previous exposure to sociology prof tim mccauley made it very interesting i always enjoyed these lectures so much so that i switched into sociology overall very easy course and exams check out his website URL for he might have the breakdown of the course your looking into which is always helpful
16258,Timothy  McCauley,dr mccauley is the best prof for this course i was a bit scared going into this course because everything seemed so abstract at first but he dumbed everything down for us and made it all so crystal clear by far one of the best profs at york his lectures were short quick and sweet he is also very easy on the eyes i loved this class
16259,Timothy  McCauley,the best prof at york just read his notes and you will definately do well
16260,Timothy  McCauley,alright prof classes were rather monotonous since a slide reader all important info is on the slides make sure you copy the slides in class as much as possible since some info is missing or different on the slides he provides online are useless and have unrealistic expectations but prof is willing to help with any issues
16261,Timothy  McCauley,he relies very heavily on his power point slides most if not all of his lecture is simply reading what the slides say he also moves too fast at times and says that the slides will be available on his website though they were not available until a week before the exam do the readings they round out the important concepts in lecture
16262,Timothy  McCauley,i owe him a great part of my success in grad school i was lucky to have the chance to have him for courses through which i learned a lot and found great interest in sociology he is an intellectual and an experienced inspiring and helpful prof he encourages his students to think analytically and his lectures are very valuable and informative
16263,Heather  Adams-Blair,if you strive to do more than just learn the material you will average out she is a professor who is passionate and therefore has high expectations prepares you for the real world
16264,Heather  Adams-Blair,awful teacher not very helpful rude and inconsiderate makes things a lot harder than they need to be
16265,Heather  Adams-Blair,awesome
16266,Heather  Adams-Blair,best teacher ever had very nice knows her material really enjoyed the class
16267,Heather  Adams-Blair,shes a very nice teacher and knows her material but the class is a one credit class and we have homework alot and the test are really really hard i have a c so far and im working harder on that class than my credit level courses
16268,Heather  Adams-Blair,all around great professor

16280,Ingrid  Stadler,needs to retire past her prime one of the worst teachers ive hade thus far at the bac
16281,Ingrid  Stadler,she was one of my best professors her classes were memories i will keep for life thank you
16282,Ingrid  Stadler,she is by far the most intelligent expirienced and interetsing professor at the school she is insanely energetic as a professor her courses are difficult but well worth it one of the best professors had in very respected schools
16283,Ingrid  Stadler,nice lady interesting and knowledgable and likes her students but very bad at breaking things down so that they are clear for the students wanders off topic all the time many times will put her opinions and interpretations forward as the things we should learn rather than discussing and focusing on the ideas from the class readings
16284,Ingrid  Stadler,no comments
16285,Ingrid  Stadler,an amazing woman to know one of the greatest teachers the b.a.c will ever have
16286,Ingrid  Stadler,challenging class ingrid is the best
16287,Don  Hood,mr hood is the most incompetent instructor i have ever had
16288,Don  Hood,many know that the world was created in six days and on the seventh day the flying spaghetti monster rested what is unknown is that on the eighth day the flying spaghetti monster realized that all of humankind understood the concept of significant figures so he created donald linn hood
16289,Don  Hood,many know that the world was created in six days and on the day god rested what is unknown is that on the day god looked down on his kingdom and was displeased so he created don hood
16290,Don  Hood,he is actually a nice guy even though he appears to be tough
16291,Don  Hood,and not only that his instructions in his lab manual are horrible not much clarity and you basically have to figure out on your own and out of the blue how to solve some of the postlabs absolutely ridiculous his exams have the most random questions a lot of which is not even from his notes confusing and unclear questions
16292,Don  Hood,mr hood is very unfair with his grading policies he is one of those teachers who try hard to take points off of assignments and with lab worth only pnts each point counts slu overall seems that way now trying to weed people out especially in chem lab don is not of any help nor is he courteous when students have questions arrogant
16293,Don  Hood,he is such an amazing person he is always willing to help you out he like freshman very much but he has always been more than helpful and his knowledge is spread out throughout all the chem classes he helps me with organic and analytical as we
16294,Don  Hood,don hood is an to all freshmen he will never compromise even if he is blatantly wrong or if he misgraded something if you try and talk to him about your grade he will instantly dismiss you as just being incompetent this guy is a real
16295,Don  Hood,don hood is one of the most uncompromising unhelpful and selfrighteous men i have ever met the grading are completely subjective and depends only on which ta grades your lab even though there is no way to avoid this miserable lab do not be surprised if a ta helps you with one of the labs and you still end up with a
16296,Don  Hood,i dont understand how someone so arrogant can teach in a university and be an example when he screams at you you can see how he thiks he is cool just because of that really childish person get away from him
16297,Don  Hood,wait for it to be over
16298,Don  Hood,don hood is a very good instructor do not let him intimidate you only for show he is extremely helpful but be aware he will not just give you answers
16299,Don  Hood,in the beginning i was terrified of the infamous don hood but then he turned out to be quite nice he was rarely ever in lab really helpful just mess around in lab and follow the dress code and you will be fine
16300,Don  Hood,intimidating at first but nice once you get to know him follow directions ask stupid questions and screw around in lab
16301,Don  Hood,never around except for grading so pray for a helpful ta makes sure every point is scrutinized
16302,Don  Hood,no comments
16303,Don  Hood,use whiteout or pencil if you follow that policy and the dress code than be fine
16304,Don  Hood,maybe a little scary at times but he really is helpful and a nice guy when it comes down to it
16305,Don  Hood,can be arrogant at times but overall he really does care and wants you to succeed you really avoid him if you have to take labso just get used to his style realize he has good intentions approachable most of the time
16306,Don  Hood,kind of lame the videos on the cd to prepare us for class are funny he never really comes in except to yell at people for their clothes make sure you always have your lab sheets and goggles your ta will be your teacher so i hope you have a good one like i do
16307,Jon  Fisher,honestly i just go to class to look at him
16308,Jon  Fisher,dr fisher is really funny undoubtedly very knowledgable but he lectures extremely fast i recommend rewatching tegrity for his lectures because he often elaborates on his slideshows says things not written down but that he will test you on on the tests he usually never takes questions directly from his hw he rewords them
16309,Jon  Fisher,not too shabby enjoyed him
16310,Jon  Fisher,you can tell he is passionate about teaching and his lectures are highly educational he throws in funny remarks during his lectures to keep class interesting use his homework as a way to keep track of what to study he also gives out old tests with answer keys before each exam
16311,Jon  Fisher,this guy is so great i honestly have never experienced anything like this in my entire life whether he is cycling around campus or lecturing jon fisher exudes charisma and biology i learned so much about both biology and myself it really hurt when he left us to ogilvie a nice smart but extremely annoying lady where have you gone jon
16312,Jon  Fisher,dr fisher is super chill guy and his lectures are easy to pay attention however his tests are super detail oriented and have lots of small things all in all though i would definitely take his class again
16313,Jon  Fisher,fisher was the funniest biology professor had if you payed attention during lecture and read the chapters the class was easy would take him second semester if i could
16314,Jon  Fisher,dr fisher was awesome he says the funniest corny jokes during class he keeps his lectures interesting records all lectures on tegrity but you have to come to class in order to get the clicker points tests were not difficult for me but were difficult for classmates class averages on exams were usually in the low final exam was easy
16315,Jon  Fisher,he speaks very monotone and does not keep students engaged by any means thus it is very hard to stay awake and the way he presents material makes it difficult to remember this makes the exams incredibly difficult the exams are also random and unrelated to inclass information fisher is also very wishywashy when it comes to class policies
16316,Jon  Fisher,this guy is hysterical his class is fairly easy as easy as bio can getsome topics are just difficult by nature and ok but he super clear on supposed to be on the test with that in mind tests are still pretty fair and definitely the most fun professor to take wish he was teaching second semester
16317,Jon  Fisher,moved through material quickly but was really knowledgeable and explained key concepts well
16318,Jon  Fisher,dr fisher taught the first half of the semester of my class and i really enjoyed taking his class he explained everything very well and always made sure to answer questions sufficiently the best part of his class is his great sense of humor that makes each class interesting without taking academic value away from the class
16319,Jon  Fisher,dr fisher was a great professor i liked his lectures he tried to keep it interesting and sometimes share a scrap of his personal life he tries to answer any questions during a lecture i never used office hours but i knew they were available his tests bad compared to other bio professors bio is just a hard course overall
16320,Jon  Fisher,what a great class dr fisher is a wonderful teacher and probably one of the most interesting and clear biology teachers had at saint louis if you have the chance to take him make sure you do four tests total and online assignments which are optional the tests can be tricky so make sure that you study the material well
16321,Jon  Fisher,exercise physio was an incredibly fascinating and relatable class that being said fisher is a very specific grader on free response questions and his multiple choice items very easy you can only miss questions on the entire test to get the lowest a something that is almost guaranteed to happen the material gets tough its a hard class
16322,Jon  Fisher,fisher seems like an articulate personable guy and his lectures are interesting and simple to grasp that being said condescending in office hours and his tests never reflected the concepts he stressed in class definitely not the easy elective people make it out to be but probably the most interesting higher level biology class
16323,Jon  Fisher,nice guy easy class if you have some background in bio like from highschool lectures are alright
16324,Jon  Fisher,very clear lectures i liked him better than nordell tests are tough generally easy quiz points
16325,Jon  Fisher,he is a great professor explains everything clearly the class was somewhat easy but there is lots of reading involved
16326,Jon  Fisher,awesome very helpful very approachable if you try in class and do the reading do fine
16327,Andrew  Lo,financial markets one of the most imperativo al courses from finance curriculum with andrew lo very inspirational
16328,Andrew  Lo,when i took fin was called finance theory he is funny and gives amazing lectures the exams are a little hard but manageable he gives an excelent foundation of managerial and corporate finance he leads the laboratory for financial engineering thats awesome is a finance master mind
16329,Andrew  Lo,no comments
16330,Matthew  Elam,the class was so boring he is my worst teacher in my life
16331,Matthew  Elam,this may be the most repugnant instructor of my entire education
16332,Matthew  Elam,no comments
16333,Richard  Doctor,nice to have a believer teaching in a dept philosphy that has knothing but secluar instructors if your christian take him
16334,Richard  Doctor,great teacher he taught me so much about writing a good paper never recieve so much feedback on my writing from a teacher before funny and keeps it interesting
16335,Richard  Doctor,great teacher knows his field extremely well i actually looked forward to his classes lots of essays to write but expected in an english course makes time fly with humorous stories and comments definitely recommended
16336,Richard  Doctor,this man is the most selfabsorbing egotistical selfimpressed individual i have met in a very very long time needs to check his manners in regard to condensending overtones in class toward students thankfully i did well in this class obviously did not care for his teaching style nor his mannerisms toward students
16337,Richard  Doctor,love the doctor would take him for any class he teaches just an all around neat guy
16338,Richard  Doctor,i feel bad for how much my friends and i fooled around during class he was a little boring at time but i think it was more the subject he knows what he teaches very well
16339,Richard  Doctor,i count this class as a height in my college experience do you desire to be a better writer i encourage you to learn from the best richard will help you develope as a writer he wear his religion on his sleeve but love radiates from his heart
16340,Richard  Doctor,mr doctor is a really great teacher he is really open to people and is open about himself at first because of his personality i thought it would be an extremely easy class but actually it he grades papers more difficultly than in eng overall he is a great teacher though you have to do work though
16341,Richard  Doctor,great guy great teacher highly recommend him
16342,Richard  Doctor,great instructor he always keeps the class interested and is good at helping you when you need it as long as you show up for class and write papers the way he wants them written and do the readings you will get a good grade in the class
16343,Richard  Doctor,this teacher seems to be very impressed with himself discourages independent thinking write papers the way he wants you to write them you will do fine also seems to find humour in humiliating students this i find unexcusable behavior in a professional needs to reevaluate teaching style
16344,Richard  Doctor,doctor is the best intelligent and informative lectures put effort into the class and do fine take him
16345,Richard  Doctor,best english prof i ever had i am a much better writer and thinker for having had him you will work for your grade but worth it highly recommended
16346,Richard  Doctor,richard does not discourage independent thinking quite the opposite i disagreed with him completely and still aced my papers what looks for and teaches is quality and clarity of exposition express yourself well and you will do well
16347,Richard  Doctor,he is very hard and seems to be a hard grader and so forth
16348,Richard  Doctor,very self impressed discourages independent thinking in his students just write what you believe he will want you to write and you will do just fine unfortunately that the way to foster a real voice among students now is it
16349,Richard  Doctor,best techer i hever had but he makes you work for it
16350,Richard  Doctor,richard is awesome great sense of humor extremely knowledgable tough grader but he will really improve your writing ability
16351,Richard  Doctor,no comments
16352,Richard  Doctor,he is a very smart man with a terrible dry sense of humor grades papers quite tough follow his examples and write papers exactly like he suggests and ace the class
16353,Anthony  James,he was an awesome teacher he is passionate in what he teaches he likes details thoughs but i would take him again he is an awesome teacher
16354,Anthony  James,this dude is incredibly wellspoken and humble he never talks down to his students and always respects their views he makes the class a very chill experience and as long as you do the inquisitives you will definitely pass in terms of the tests he lets you use an index card and recommend just writing timeline so you can nail chronology
16355,Anthony  James,just keep up with your work and you will be fine
16356,Anthony  James,cares about students
16357,Anthony  James,he is someone who call an intellectual i could just sit down and listen to him talk about things passionate about very smart funny and gives great lectures if you turn in a paper he marks grammatical errors and work cited mistakes take good notes and refer to the book you have to work for your grade but he makes it very enjoyable
16358,Anthony  James,dr james is an awesome instructor his tests are great but beware of chronological order as long as you try you will be just fine if you love history take his class had two classes with him and got an a both times
16359,Anthony  James,james is a fantastic teacher if you bomb the midterm or final it will not kill you the inquizzitives he gives are impossible to fail and are an easy a he is heavy on reading the debates he gives are fantastic and another easy a i would definitely take him again
16360,Anthony  James,his lectures are engaging best professor at coastal prepares you for the exams by making the course fun and interesting
16361,Anthony  James,dr james is filled with tons of excellent information he provides resources to help guide you through the readings participation and doing assignment using the resources provided you are sure to do well
16362,Anthony  James,having emails ignored all that great especially when i was struggling in the class for the most part if you read the textbook and really study the material you can do good on the tests you have to read two short books and do a group project reflection and quiz on them the inquisitive assignments are impossible to fail
16363,Anthony  James,dr james at first i was hesitant to take his class as i signed up for another professor but the class was split due to size i am very glad i had dr james his tests are long and he is a little disorganized at times but his lectures are fun and he is very passionate about history will make you work for your grade overall i really liked him
16364,Anthony  James,very passionate about teaching i was worried about taking him he seemed like he would be a tough teacher that care about students passing on day one i have been more wrong he was very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions quizzes are mc and based on reading exams are short answer and essays know mla format papers
16365,Anthony  James,not the easy a but he makes that clear from day you will work for it the essays are easy just wait until the last day to do them study for the quizzes by doing the activities on nortonstudyspace and read the corresponding page numbers from the quizzes flashcards or you will fail them good lectures and invested in his students
16366,Anthony  James,welcome to college because in this class you must read the textbook you have to write papers he give out a study guide he says the lecture is on one wavelength the textbook is on another and the tests cover both wavelengths you must study before the tests be surprised if i pass the class
16367,Anthony  James,lectures are good but quizzes based on them gives a lot of work and assigns pgs to read for every days when i took his class i was taking four others thank god my other classes have a big load of homework like he did for the exams he tells you that its covers things that are on the outline which is basically everything
16368,Anthony  James,you have to read the textbook or you pass any quizzes or tests quizzes are worth and each exam is majority of the time his quizzes based on his lectures
16369,Anthony  James,good teacher if you miss class you will get set back must read the book in order to make good grades on the tests each class is lecture based mid terms are pretty clear cut just like any other history class not hard but you have to apply yourself
16370,Anthony  James,i do not recommend his class to anyone who is not a history fanatic he assigns an ungodly amount of reading and has quizzes every week with other assignments as well he is not clear when you ask him how you should study if you can take another professor i highly recommend it he also had midterms and finals super hard class to pass
16371,Anthony  James,i really liked him i took his class online he does a lot of discussion boards and you have to write a few papers but he is a very good instructor i learned a lot from his class
16372,Anthony  James,he was great he does expect a lot you have to read and take a lot of notes but he does keep it interesting
16373,Gary  Clark,class is really easy you get study guides for the test look up on the study guide and you got an a in the class lectures are pointless you really learn anything is fun if you liked health and phys ed in highschool basically all it is you really learn why you do the tests you just kinda do them
16374,Gary  Clark,cool teacher and makes the subject very easy if you do well in this class it will be your fault
16375,Gary  Clark,teaching middle school ed was a fun class there is a lot of gym activities and a few class room assignement there arent many tests and a few quizzes go to class and do the readings and you should be fine he is a good teacher
16376,Gary  Clark,this prof is one of the best his sense of humor helps u remember and learn the material the workload is just right and his tests difficult but not easy either i would highly recommend him u will learn a lot
16377,Gary  Clark,mr clark had to be the best teacher i have had all year go to class and you should get an a in and motor if you go to class and study for the tests its an easy a as well i learned to juggle in which was the best thing i learned all highly recommend this prof
16378,Gary  Clark,motor development and fundies are both really boring you will read everything you need to know for motor development from the book his lectures are a waste of time however both classes are very easy
16379,Gary  Clark,all he needs to do is show up on time and one of the best professors around has lots of experiance minimal effort required for an a in his classes
16380,Gary  Clark,very easy prof all you have to do is read and go to class he is late all the time though he exactly teach at a college level usually lower the material is interesting and he never tries to over analyze a topic and keeps things pretty simple cool and most of the time funny
16381,Gary  Clark,good professor tests can be hard so make sure you read he occasionally is funny with his weird sense of humor keeps class interesting you can tell he enjoys teaching
16382,Gary  Clark,cool guy only had him for a week but seems real easy to get along with and definately tries to keep you interested in his topic
16383,Gary  Clark,good teacher very helpful and easy to get along with
16384,Gary  Clark,he made motor development very fun and interesting a secret the final exam is the study guide he gives you or at least it was for us good teacher he still remembers me and i took him last semester
16385,Gary  Clark,very easy has an attendance policy only because he has nothing else to grade or challenge you with easy a if you go to class
16386,Gary  Clark,class is fun and he is not a bad professor really likes to talk to much though
16387,Gary  Clark,although he is always late for class overall a pretty good prof he has a strange sense of humor but tries to make class interesting his tests can be somewhat tricky so i recommend reading the book thoroughly if you want to do good on his exams
16388,Gary  Clark,usually late to class but funny and not boring
16389,Gary  Clark,for someone who is all about being professional and being on time he sure is late every day his class is rather pointless and very boring he needs to teach at a college level not kindergarden
16390,Gary  Clark,no comments
16391,Tosha  Lomask,tosha was the best professor ever had bachelors and masters level included she also makes a wonderful advisor usually willing to take on new advisees
16392,Tosha  Lomask,i really liked tosha she was a really great teacher and i learned a lot about literacy and children
16393,Tosha  Lomask,best teacher at saint rose yet tosha really knows her stuff and teaches it the way that we should teach it to young children very hands on and so caring highly reccommended
16394,Tosha  Lomask,one of the nicest and helpfull professors at the college she also is very intelligent and understanding
16395,Tosha  Lomask,wonderful experience made a weekend class enjoyable and meaningful she focused on real aspects of teaching and ways to improve the system
16396,James  Price,i actually went to the university and forged a complaint against him because he was at the point back in where he couldnt write clearly anymore everybody in class would ask him to translate his writing which are part of his lectures all done on an
16397,James  Price,hard prof boring man old as the hills nice but dry
16398,Jan  Humphreys,top notch professor knows ask him anything on entemology and he will have some info about it very well respected in the working community by biologists entomologists ecologists and the like helped me get a job now retired and doing what he wants
16399,Jan  Humphreys,great prof he will be missed
16400,Jan  Humphreys,no comments
16401,Jan  Humphreys,i had him for one summer and enjoyed him tremendously he is a funny and kind man he cared about my grade alot and was willing to help great prof
16402,Jan  Humphreys,i took a summer class with him once and it was fun we had a lot of outdoor activities like going to yellow creek not a hard class and a fun guy likes talking about diseases a lot if you can take your intro course with him do it
16403,Jan  Humphreys,he care to teach if you care to learn take him
16404,Denise  Kelly,she is the worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life she marked me wrong if i did my math vertically instead of if my fratcion lines were diagonal instead of horizontal im not joking she wont allow you to have scrap paper and then takes points off if there are scribble marks on your paper sucks
16405,Denise  Kelly,it is a huge discredit to ccsu and to dr craine that this woman is allowed to continue teaching she is horrid both as a teacher and as a person what goes around comes around and this woman is surrounded by bad karma
16406,Denise  Kelly,takes attendance every day need to be there very stubborn on how she wants things written her way and if you dont write it her way its wrong nice funny lady not an easy class however takes grade math and makes it very hard somehow if you put a lot of time in youll pass if not its very stressful dont go out of your war to take this cla
16407,Denise  Kelly,pretty crazy had favorites randomly collected homework which she spends half of class going over i recommend her
16408,Denise  Kelly,shes a pretty good teacher a little boring but easy and she tries so hard to be funny
16409,Denise  Kelly,this teacher is highly unfair she took off points because i rounded to this teacher also takes points off for not erasing something completely or having something crossed out on the page i highly recommend that you avoid this class at all costs definetly not worth it worst professor had so far at ccsu i hate her
16410,Denise  Kelly,my little sister could pass the course on the material but i think she took off points for spelling my name wrong again she tooks off points for correctly answering the question as explained in the book but not as she explained in class the book must have been when has pie been a variable makes grade math confusing
16411,Denise  Kelly,crazy but it makes the class more exciting best math teacher had since grade she does take off a lot of points if things written the way she likes but she warns you about it beforehand class went by quickly and lets you out early most of the time good person
16412,Denise  Kelly,its grade work that we did but her grading system is terrible you get points off because youre not putting all the equal signs the way she wants it or your work is messy or overly erased or not placed under the original example when you should get you end up getting like a because of all the extra points she takes off yack
16413,Denise  Kelly,this teacher sucks so bad i would run away if you are thinking about taking her she is retarded wont help you and grading system is completely unfair do yourself a favor and dont take her ever
16414,Denise  Kelly,slightly crazier then a can of dried peaches
16415,Denise  Kelly,ok i dont know if i should write something but i sat in her class just for the first day and dropped it she presented the class as if we were in elementary school and frightened me the work load appeared to be too hard for a level class and so i just wanted to warn people before they jumped head first into that classroom good luck
16416,Denise  Kelly,horrible avoid taking this teacher at all costs she will help you but it doesnt matter because she doesnt know how to teach anyways
16417,Denise  Kelly,her grading system is rediculous homework and quizzes count double what tests count and if you do bad on a homework assignment you can have your grade drop a lot idid bad on one homework assignment took me from an a to a low c nice person and even a decent teacher but terrible grading system avoid her
16418,Denise  Kelly,her grading system totally sucks for tests and homework the only reason i went to class was because she was so strict about attendence
16419,Denise  Kelly,worst teacher ever she takes points off on a test if you mispell a word and last i checked this an english class seriously do not take this class with her as the professor
16420,Denise  Kelly,beware i have never failed a class before until this one i did all the work but her grading sucks stupid how she corrects hw she only picks questions out of the entire sheet and if u get the rest right except those she checks its an f she should not be teaching
16421,Denise  Kelly,she sucks she fails u on a test not because they answers are wrong but because u didnt put the equal signs in the right spot freakin
16422,Denise  Kelly,do not take a math class with this woman the classes are pointless she tells bad jokes and nothing gets accomplished she grades very hard and if u dont do something her way ull fail i would definitely not recommend her
16423,Denise  Kelly,pretty condescending and likes to be a dictator which tell you from the beginning if you do every little thing her way not going to do well no matter if a different way works better for you or not good as a person but recommend her as a professor
16424,Mary  Shea,worst spanish teacher ever a fluent spanish speaker and i failed her class she does not know how to teach spanish in a way beginners would understand i bought the textbook and never used it i had to correct her multiple times during class to dont take her class
16425,Mary  Shea,take this class the feeling you get on the first day that tells you maybe to drop it and take something else listen to that because by mid semester if you are a beginner you will be buried with the course work and she give you the help you need
16426,Mary  Shea,thankfully been doing well in class but only because i took spanish in high school my heart goes out to the students in class who really have never taken spanish students sitting next to me clearly study their ass off to no avail shea is unclear and fully address questions terrible at teaching spanish beginners dont take
16427,Mary  Shea,really confusing at times so try to pay attention she is very serious about only talking in spanish from the minute you walk in the door you have chapter tests and have lots of temas every week having the text book is a must you spend most of class talking to other people over microphones in spanish so if you social good luck
16428,Mary  Shea,i really enjoy her she is stern when it comes to being responsible and paying attention she makes it clear that she is not your mom and will not hold you hand you have to work for your grade and do the simple online assigned work.if you need help or clarification she will give it to you also you must have a book of your own
16429,Mary  Shea,if you are going to take this class be sure to rely on your book professor shea is not always clear but she is willing to help you in office hours
16430,Mary  Shea,not a great teacher teach beginning material like you would expect in a beginning class assumes taken years of high school spanish like i had had i not though i would have failed take heart though you can still get a without doing any homework if this is review for you
16431,Mary  Shea,shea is a great woman and is really passionate about spanish and the different cultures and places i just wish there was more in class conversation as the class is dependent on writing with the workbook journals and paragraphs basically turn everything in on time and you can do well her tests difficult if you pay attention in class
16432,Mary  Shea,very friendly teacher and lots and lots of hw presentations last one is worth dairies are a must do not miss if you are going for a a worth of your grade all of class time is working in the book with your partners and presenting it to the teacher she calls on you with cards that have your name although classwork is not graded
16433,Mary  Shea,she is a great teacher i took her last semester and she became very fermliar with all the students very fast by learning our names faster then most teachers her lectures start at the begining of class and end at the end of class she wastes no time during the class time even this semester she stops and talkes to me see how im doing over all gre
16434,Mary  Shea,lame professor she only has one way of teaching cant explain the material in a different way no help outside of class and she told me maybe i should drop take a different professor
16435,Mary  Shea,um i can sum this professor up in two words she sucks nice lady but that doesnt cout towards her teaching ability she focus way to much on the culture and not enough on what we need to know to pass her class she just expects people to know any ding dong can read the book but she cant really help explain what it is that we are learning
16436,Mary  Shea,profe shea is a genius seriously she is brilliant try talking to her about how she learned spanish she is an exceptional professor and uses a combination of activities powerpoints cultural things and the textbook to teach i absolutely loved taking spanish with her and learned so much a fair grader and likes to tease her students
16437,Mary  Shea,unless you need help an easy enthusaitic instructor if you test well in my particular case you may find yourself suprised in my situation she actually told me a little over halfway through the class to drop get a w and try again she seem to want all students to succeed there is no help outside of class by the way
16438,Mary  Shea,awesome teacher very enthusiastic very brilliant she loves her job and always has everything planned out so well
16439,Mary  Shea,very good professor my prayers are with her as she just lost her son in iraq
16440,Mary  Shea,i really enjoyed being in her classes very interested in her students she could focus more on the grammer than the culture but overall i really liked her too bad what happened to her son
16441,Mary  Shea,the class is kinda boring but i guess yoou get your units
16442,Mary  Shea,a very nice teacher helps you understand it and test are not very hard but you must do your hmk to pass makes you study but she is a very good teacher
16443,Mary  Shea,fluent and take time to understand you beware though make you comfortable in class talk about everyone makes mistakes then go though your tests with a finetooth comb
16444,Norm  Johnson,i took classes years ago when he first came to ic i am back in college again after lo these many years and still teaching remains impactful his clarity passion and adventurous spirit along with his no b.s modality of keeping things moving and challenging are even more valuable now as i look back best of the best this one
16445,Norm  Johnson,hard teacher but all of his pushing is so you can find the better you he gave me a really hard time and i thank him for it love love love me some norman and his wrestling boots
16446,Norm  Johnson,i love norm he makes you find the magic for yourself which can be frusrating but in the end it makes you so much more fulfilled
16447,Norm  Johnson,norm is great you have to buy into what he teaches like you do with all acting teachers in order to swear by him but once you submit and commithe can change your life i encourage you all to at least try what norm has to offer before you judge it
16448,Norm  Johnson,norm is a great guy but he plays favorites also i seem to agree with his opinions on good theater
16449,Norm  Johnson,great teacher inspiring
16450,Norm  Johnson,dr nojo has really enlivened my ideas about theatre and hell about life too he is an amazingly passionate teacher and an captivating director come back from sabbatical norm loves you
16451,Norm  Johnson,dr nojo is a genius who allows you to discover an incredible amount about yourself and the art of acting
16452,Norm  Johnson,norm was by far the best acting coach i had he allowed the actor to find their own technique with the tools he supplied he allowed discovery and kept acting fun that is why we do it he was one of the few to those who do teach does
16453,Norm  Johnson,really know anything about acting very pompous care about his students
16454,Norm  Johnson,very pretentious
16455,Norm  Johnson,awesome hands down
16456,Norm  Johnson,i even have nojo for a classhe is the coordinator of the acting program and almost everyone seems to love him they say a genius so goodbut they also say that if you love norm you hate greg bostwick which is so inconceivable
16457,Julia  Allen,the reviews are most definitely correct about her she is very defensive and wont let you get a point across she is very funny but rude at time the class is a easy grade tho the book is not really needed buy an online book for cheap
16458,Julia  Allen,she is rude rude rude if you do not agree with her ask questions on assignments or try to take notes she will get defensive tell you off in front of the class or just give you a bad grade for that particular assignment just because she can this is by far the worst prof had since attending this school be mindful of the reviews
16459,Julia  Allen,a great teacher funny she talks to us and the whole class is a conversation a class that you mind going to group discussions are great group discussions are most of the class because we all give our individual opinions easy to learn and be engaged
16460,Julia  Allen,by far the worst teacher i have had wish i paid more attention to her reviews majority are accurate save yourself the headache
16461,Julia  Allen,great teacher im taking her class right now and that is the best class i have this semester shes funny and full of good jokes while talking about the book read the book and do the hw and you will pass her class with an easy a oh and participate to the conversations because mrs allen has a grade for participation take her class
16462,Julia  Allen,she is nice and a very social person her tests are relatively simple as long as you study and know terms and common sense she is a teacher you will definitely remember after the class
16463,Julia  Allen,never take her class gets off topic always never teaches only reads from the the time by telling fun out of people who disagree with her opinions please dont take her class
16464,Julia  Allen,this was one of the worst teacher had we get off topic alot and if you agree with what she says she shows animosity towards you.you can never make an a on any of her assignments and forgets everything that she says in the previous class.laugh at all of her stale jokes unless end up failing her class because shes just vindictive
16465,Julia  Allen,this lady does not have her head up her ass she is brilliant pay attention to the subtle and enjoy a fun class for a change
16466,Julia  Allen,took her for sociology not hard at all but she will get off topic a lot read the book to pass because she speaks of things in the book prob of the class
16467,Julia  Allen,good teacher very funny however she does tend get off topic she doesnt give any homework but if no one reads the material prior to class then start only one research paper and test she can be a bit sarcastic but i found her to be hilarious i take her again in a heartbeat just make you study and be on time
16468,Julia  Allen,i took mrs allen fall of thngs you need to know she gets off topic a lot you have to read the material before class and participation is a can be a little sarcastic but she means no harm laugh at her jokes be on time to class read the material easy a
16469,Julia  Allen,do not challenge her and if you agree with her you will become her enemy she can be very rude and disrespectful in a sneaky way so that it bring attention to her only to the person whom she is attacking i got an a in her class but i would not take another class taught by her she seems to have issues with foreigners
16470,Julia  Allen,she is very opinionated and if you disagree with her you become her enemy she can be rude and disrespectful in a sneaky way that bring attention to it only to the person whom she is attacking i received an a in the class but i take another class taught by her she seems to have issues with foreigners
16471,Julia  Allen,honestly she is the worst teacher i have ever had she only reads the definitions from the book we always got off topic so we really never discussed anything of importance very opinionated she shows favoritism and if not on her good side you do well take her
16472,Julia  Allen,best teacher i have ever had she made coming to college and expectation instead of a pain she treats everyone equal and u will never be bored im really going to miss this class because there is really none like her
16473,Julia  Allen,professor julia allen is a wonderful and also a knowledgeable person she makes the class fun we had debates on everything if you are smart you will take her last but not least she grades on the curve
16474,Julia  Allen,if you want to make an a take her she is to opinionated that if your answers agree with what she think is right she is going to mark it wrong she know how to grade or teach this class will be a self taught class so read your book everynight or just take her
16475,Julia  Allen,she feels strongly about research and her opinion behind the research no point in arguing with her just take in the information she shares if you read the book in depth the test be hard the only reason quizzes is if too many students are late she gave spontaneous homework nothing strenuous
16476,Julia  Allen,ms allen was a great instructor not only about sociology i learned so much from her she is very human attitude is everything she treats every one equal mrs allen was a great professor she is very entertaining teaching
16477,Susan  Nelson,she is clearly one of the worse professors i have ever had she understand the topic and therefore explain or answer simple questions we hardly used the book and the test were nothing like the study guide or anything we did in class
16478,Susan  Nelson,if you attend class everyday you do homework and come to her with your questions the class will become alot eaisier math hard just a challenge ms nelson really knows what doing and she never gives an excuse for why she explain problems plus cheerful most times by nature so that helps
16479,Susan  Nelson,she simply goes over the problems in the book she even lecture
16480,Susan  Nelson,she simply goes over the problems in the book she even lecture
16481,Susan  Nelson,i took a week calc course and was sure i was going to fail she is one of the most helpful teachers ever had she gives you every opportunity she can to pass the class i made a on the final an i still made a in the class if you take her just make sure you do your online quizes
16482,Susan  Nelson,she is the best math teacher ever i started the class thinking i would fail but she teaches so well and gives you every opportunity to pass the class she responds back to emails very quickly and always asks all students to come by her office any time with any questions she actually loves to help you pass
16483,Susan  Nelson,very helpful she will make you love math
16484,Susan  Nelson,she is a good helper when you ask her any questions she spend a lot of time explaining any math problems that you do not understand if you come to her office she requires a lot of work from you overall great
16485,Susan  Nelson,she doesnt seem to care about her job very much no emails no updates group project which is really only required discussions between students not a fun math class
16486,Susan  Nelson,i think that she is great no really you do some work but hey she helps you and it is possible to get a good grade like i did
16487,Susan  Nelson,she was a good teacher you can ask lots of questions sometimes a little unorganizd but she is very helpful take her again
16488,Susan  Nelson,ms nelson is one of the best teacher she deal with the problem and visit desk to desk until the student is not clear she is very helpful and she makes the course very easir so i will not be able to find any teacher better than her.i am planning to take the same teacher in the next calculus class but its my unfortunate that she is not going to tak
16489,Susan  Nelson,expects students to have learned the material before she teaches it she does not spoon feed but she also does not explain it herself not very effective for most poeple a majority of the quizes doen by yourself and at home or online
16490,Susan  Nelson,you quizzes was helpfull to me your explainations were clear and easy to understand and the testes were hard enough to challenge students but not too hard it was very interested to take your course
16491,Susan  Nelson,a wonderful teacher shes always willing to go out of her way to help whether its on a one to one basis or in a group her teaching style is different but she manages to get you to think independently and question ideas rather than just mindlessly recalling stuff from memorization take her class its worth the work
16492,Susan  Nelson,ms nelson is an excellent teacher i am taking her for an online and her teaching and instructions are very comprehensive i would have her as a math teacher over anyone else she has great character and that says alot about a person
16493,Susan  Nelson,if students have a question she helps students a lot not only in the class but also in her office she has lots of enthusiasm to make people to understand and she gives good grade for tests also the style of her teaching makes people more focus on it therefore i would like to recommand her
16494,Susan  Nelson,true she has a different style of teaching that can be confusing at first.tests r hard but is a combination of quizzes and lecture she willing to help alot if asked she expects you to do outside work and spoonfeed the answers so you actually understand what doing
16495,Susan  Nelson,absolutely no help at all consistently complains that you should have already learned things in precalculus and then offers no help to learn these things
16496,Susan  Nelson,what ever the person below said was absolutly right.do not recommend her ever
16497,Gale  Bruce,professor bruce is a great educator she goes over everything in the book will have to read the material and there is a lot of writing but what do you expect its english
16498,Gale  Bruce,the perfect teacher i learned alot and she will work with you with whatever you have going on all around best teacher i have ever had
16499,Gale  Bruce,mrs bruce was a good teacher ever she is easy even though i was a esl student in learning suport but it did not bother her she always worked with me
16500,Gale  Bruce,i love mrs bruce she is a really great professor
16501,Gale  Bruce,she is very good
16502,Gale  Bruce,she is the best she has a logical style of teaching
16503,Gale  Bruce,she makes you work if you are serious about becoming a great writer take her if not find a different teacher
16504,Gale  Bruce,mrs bruce is a thorough and helpful teacher i gained more from her class than i expected to she is quick witted and can be difficult but will go out of her way to help any student pass or make an a
16505,Gale  Bruce,oh my god da bomb not an easy a but a def a you have to do the work and you will pass gonna come off mean as hell and a hard grader but not i swear i know for a fact dis lady dont read ur entire paper cause after she returned mine which i got an a on i found numerous errors take her u wont regret it
16506,Gale  Bruce,she tries to scare you at first but really eases off at the end of the semester she gives alot of work but if you turn it in on time you will get a decsent grade never had to write so many papers in one class though overall i had a great time in her class and she is fair on grades
16507,Gale  Bruce,very helpful teacher teaches a style that will help for years to come for years writing has not been my thing she essentially tought a formula for writting essays i followed it and topped out the test if you research the test in ga you will find a high failure rate amongst even the best colleges take her and you regret it
16508,Gale  Bruce,definitely difficult to deal with lose points in each gramatical mistake you make i am not kidding freaking points she grade from the scale of she grades from a to b no in her class i like her so far but gotta do well she is good at what she does but tough and condescending enough to ruin it for you
16509,Gale  Bruce,outstanding instructor very passionate about subject and exhibits strong desire to assist students in becoming sufficient writers enthused understanding caring and concerned i suggest she teach teachers how to teach more proficiently
16510,Gale  Bruce,great instructor took prior to regents and she gave a formula that works for any essay and i maxed my score i have traditionally been a poor writer
16511,Gale  Bruce,she is very helpful funny and can dress lol she makes class fun so the work wont seem like work she will make sure you learn the material if you need help she is more than happy to help shes great
16512,Gale  Bruce,she is a great teacher the first day she will make is seem like her class will be very hard but its not at all you will do alot of writing but she explains what she wants from you clearly and it is easy to understand.if you can write a decent essay you will pass she tells stories and keeps everyone intrested highly recommended
16513,Gale  Bruce,lots of class discussions
16514,Gale  Bruce,i think she is the best professor ever she really makes writing seem like an art her class really prepared me for future writing is highly reccomended.she has a great personality and keeps the class interested in what she has to say
16515,Gale  Bruce,great teacher like to use scare tactic to make you think her class is worst than it is alot of paper writting but it helps to learn wait to take her for in the fall of see you then okay lol
16516,Gale  Bruce,great teacher she will make you work for your grade we ar ehere to learn and she is a wonderful teacher
16517,Arthur  Chapman,knows history and truly enjoys when students are engaged this can be a really fun class he talks about his stories and that annoyed some students but i enjoyed listening to things i never knew about if you want to learn listen to what he says ask questions very receptive to any questions
16518,Arthur  Chapman,he is a good guy i loved him but i understand his accent this problem bothered all foreigner students he takes just two tests midd term and final and review for tests sessions
16519,Arthur  Chapman,this class is good for an easy grade you learn anything if you are majoring in history find another professor you will not learn a thing but you will get an good grade
16520,Arthur  Chapman,this guy is great i highly recommend dr chapman you must come to class though a fun teacher
16521,Arthur  Chapman,the best its the easiest a ever i love this man
16522,Arthur  Chapman,if you are just looking for an easy grade this is your man however i was looking for a history teacher and not someone out to push his own political agenda if i wanted glenn beck to teach me history i would watch more fox news i felt this class was an insult to me my intelligence and a complete waste of my time
16523,Arthur  Chapman,magnifico professori is what he said his name was the first day of class his class is not hard pay attention on review day for midterm and you will do well same for the final its not a very hard class he presents his information to where its easy to understand
16524,Arthur  Chapman,dr chapman is a wonderful storyteller however he impresses his opinions onto the subject matter with a slant towards creationism specifically christianity
16525,Arthur  Chapman,the course i took with professor chapman was world history but was dissapointed that we mostly looked over greek and roman history as for the rest of the world like asia africa and americas we only saw pictures with minimal or no explanation very easy class though
16526,Arthur  Chapman,i have been at georgia perimeter for the last and half years and i never had such a horrible teacher than dr chapman he made us buy a book but we never opened it never gave any specific notes and this exams are hard which he doesnt even cover during class test are short answers and essays and no study guides he only has grades so pretty mu
16527,Arthur  Chapman,he is a professario he claims.he knows his history so well that he need will always learn something new he keeps u entertained.his jokes r easy laugh at.as long as u take great notes do your will get an easy he gives no gives very direct make sure u speak up
16528,Arthur  Chapman,amazing and funny teacher take great note during class and listen what he go over in the review and it lay you an easy a on his final and midterm and he will curve if nobody did not make an
16529,Arthur  Chapman,professor chapman is awesome the stuff flows as if he made history a little effort will land you at a miss him
16530,Arthur  Chapman,professario is an educated man you can buy the text book used online late edition but the book isnt necessary as he is a walking history time book and info is giving both accurately and from his perspective.he gives a review before the two exams and with a recorder its a no brainer the presentation is easy you pick the topic
16531,Arthur  Chapman,lwl meaning laughs while learning.he is an excellent teacher you learn alot and he makes it interesting
16532,Arthur  Chapman,dr chapman is an amazing professor there is only one paper and the midterm and the final he is absolutely hilarious and he goes over everything you need to know for the the week before you take it best teacher had thus far
16533,Arthur  Chapman,dr chapman was one of the most interesting teachers i have had at gpc his lectures are quite interesting and his lifetime experiences and achievements are quite an addition to his classes he does only offer two tests but he does his review with the test in his hand if you pay attention and take proper notes you will have no trouble passing
16534,Arthur  Chapman,dr chapman is a highly educated gentleman he knows history very well and teaches it even better take him you will make an a if you take good notes and come to class he is extremely flexible and work with you as much as possible
16535,Arthur  Chapman,mr chapman is a great teacher but you have to study for the tests take good notes read the chapters and pay attention in class easy a the project is fun presentation in front of class willing to help any student he loves history and cares about the students
16536,Arthur  Chapman,he is so hilarious he will have you laughing every class tests are hard though you only get a midterm and a final which are half multiple choice and half fill in the blank also you have to do a project you should pass if you take good notes and do the project
16537,Scott  Brown,this guy is a hoot he seems kinda goofy but he is sharp argue with him unless sure of yourself on second thought do try and argue with him see do the work and keep up and no big deal
16538,Scott  Brown,all you need to do is write papers that have good grammar and punctuation because he is big on that you have to read all the books
16539,Scott  Brown,first you must understand that philosophy is abstract and personal you will discuss virtue and morals only papers and very strict about but if you put thought and effort into your paper you will do fine i got an a on all three fun and interesting teacher
16540,Scott  Brown,there were only grades short papers it get someone to help edit your paper go to class he will sometimes go over your head but read and write a well written college paper and you are fine i got an a and was pretty easy go to the class write your papers and read he is very smart but just listen to him and take some notes
16541,Scott  Brown,i have never been so serious and honest in my entire years on earth about anything but i must say that this teacher is the worst teacher in history he lacks knowledge of this course he expects us to read and comprehend immediately during new lectures and he refuses to grant you extra credit if you fail poorly on the test omg beware pls
16542,Scott  Brown,great teacher and extremely helpful inside and outside of the classroom
16543,Scott  Brown,just remember read the chapter before class and the cd rom helps i am selling the textbook for he is a great prof but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material his test are easy the questions come directly from ex in the book
16544,Scott  Brown,excellent professor and you must participate in class and read assigned material
16545,Scott  Brown,he is a great prof but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material he does have a personality so the class is boring his test are easy the questions come directly from ex in the book he does not explain the material too well when u ask he keeps moving leaving you very confused
16546,Scott  Brown,dr brown is brilliant in fact so brilliant i understand a word he said he is very nice and tries hard to help i think he understands that most on his level be respectful and by all means if using hurleys ed go the extra mile and purchase hurleys ed solutions manual he is soo funny have fun
16547,Scott  Brown,to all my fellow school mates for the sake of your sanity do not take philosophy with this man he is the most egotistical professor that does not know how to lecture teach or comprehend
16548,Scott  Brown,this guy is extremely genius but i came to realize this at the end of the semester so just have a positive attitude from the out set and take him with no hesitation trust me you are going to love logic for the rest of your life
16549,Scott  Brown,very good class requires some studying but questions on test are wordforword from the book easy
16550,Scott  Brown,he is a good teacher class is not dat hard test are exactly from the exercises and not hard.he does exercies on the bord so it is easy
16551,Scott  Brown,mr brown class is somewhat difficult he does give you of the test up front but you have to learn the material which i find hard he teaches the class as if you are familar with the subject i think the only one interested is himself you will have to study hard for his class
16552,Scott  Brown,excellent teacher he is highly recommended
16553,Scott  Brown,teacher although his expectations for the papers are unclear and it could be frustrating keep a positive attitude and give it a try he is very nice in grading.got to class it will be interesting if you actually read the books assigned.will take again if i needed
16554,Scott  Brown,very easy at times not required to show up at class due to the fact the test questions come from the end of each chapter
16555,Scott  Brown,this teacher is horrible he cannot make into class on time and then spends the rest of class talking about how he is smarter than all the people he works for
16556,Scott  Brown,no comments
16557,Matthew  Johnson,overall a solid professor class can be a bit dull but the professor knows the material well and get it across pretty clearly assignments and tests are very fair
16558,Matthew  Johnson,i am not sure if he is the best professor but i can definitely recommend him he makes statistics interesting and easy to understand i never got bored in his class needs to work a bit on pacing the lectures as difficult sections were rushed through
16559,Matthew  Johnson,good teacher answers questions uses textbook frequently
16560,Matthew  Johnson,prof johnson is a great professor he tries to make things as easy as possible your grade is distributed evenly through exams and homework he has to work on the pace of his lectures a little he started out slow and easy then speeded up a lot at the end when things got more difficult but it was an easy enjoyable course overall
16561,Matthew  Johnson,great professor very enthusiastic about statistics and very nice to students quizzes are easy midterm and final are a bit difficult but quite lenient in grading
16562,Matthew  Johnson,dr johnson has a doctorate in stats very knowledgeable very helpful in explaining answering questions and assisting students his tests are fair if you learn the concepts he is very enthusiastic about stats and makes the learning pleasurable
16563,Matthew  Johnson,nothing great not hard to get an a but nothing thrilling
16564,Matthew  Johnson,hottie hottie hottie i sat there the entire semester dreaming about him anyways stat is easy for me so that gave me plenty of time to day dream and i got an a say it again hottie hottie hottie
16565,Matthew  Johnson,great guy genuine experienced knows what talking about very smart and nice tough material if not a quantitative mind comes highly recommended
16566,Matthew  Johnson,good guy and he can teach the subject except he relate the work back to the business world his assigned homeworks help you study for the tests and there are no surprises on the test
16567,Matthew  Johnson,extremely approachable and will admit that stats is not the most interesting subject however always available in his office and will walk you through any of the material his exams are tough but is generous with partial credit
16568,Matthew  Johnson,no comments
16569,Matthew  Johnson,lots of work teaches the class like its a math class not like a business class i personally was used to the style so thought it was great most of the class felt it was tough good luck
16570,Stephen  Timmons,a nice guy with a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which i liked he gives you the questions to the quizzes and tests beforehand so you can just do them on your own time with the textbook and then copy them down in class from your notes make sure you keep up with the journal questions if you understan your grade helpful if you ask
16571,Stephen  Timmons,even if you follow his feedback it help future grades unnecessarily harsh in general communication that being said all work was online have to go to campus for anything so a huge plus if it for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students rate higher and consider taking again tough but doable
16572,Stephen  Timmons,tons of homework and a fair amount of reading each week definitely a harsh grader but he usually tells you what missing not the greatest personality mind and certainly intimidating but been a year since taken his class and the information has actually stuck overall difficult but worth taking
16573,Stephen  Timmons,never actually explains what he wants he will fail your assignments and not give clear feedback as to what he actually expects from you quiz journals and groupwork due each week rude and extremely unhelpful
16574,Stephen  Timmons,almost finished with my ba in history i really like to reflect upon my history class with prof timmons he is tough but you will rarely find another prof as knowledgeable i would recommend him to anyone who is serious about history or simply enjoys actual learning and is not afraid to work for it
16575,Stephen  Timmons,we had two papers a podcast to listen and respond to and reading every week told everyone upfront to expect hours of work gives commentary back for each assignment however several times i noticed a confusing response and grade and upon reaching out he got my work confused with another student you have to be on top of your grades
16576,Stephen  Timmons,a pretty dorky teacher but super nice his lectures are interesting however i suggest focusing on the book for tests quizzes etc open note quizzes and exams the journal question are rather difficult and can become overwhelming overall great teacher easy class
16577,Stephen  Timmons,the lectures are pretty mediocre and a heavy workload for a credit hour class your final grade is basically how much time you spent outside of class so possible to get an a if willing to put in the time if not a history buff and just looking to get a gen ed requirement i suggest you look elsewhere
16578,Stephen  Timmons,solid professor for the most part homework load is insane if you have other heavy courses if you love to read and write take his class he can be a bit arrogant at times but he is very qualified and knows his stuff do not fall behind on journal or review question assignments if possible you will get an a if you work hard for it
16579,Stephen  Timmons,his lectures are informational and somewhat interesting but has a lot of open ended questions and wait until someone answers them heavy written homework assignments but manageable once you get into the swing of things he makes jokes and too intimidating
16580,Stephen  Timmons,good teacher also is willing to help answer questions fair grader and explains why you missed points good personality
16581,Stephen  Timmons,really tough class questions are lengthy and is more english oriented than history do homework everyday get ahead quick
16582,Stephen  Timmons,his terrible so long as someone answers his open ended questions just stand there until someone does helpful if you have questions but a bit odd the grading bad but the journal questions really add up so stay on top of the assignments
16583,Stephen  Timmons,one of my favorite professors at cstate highly knowledgable helpful friendly and hilarious preparation homework and reading are essential all are inclass essays but he gives you the questions ahead of time so you can prepare and allows you to bring notes to the exam take if you want to learn look elsewhere for an easy a
16584,Stephen  Timmons,i would recommend him expect homework but very manageable if you do the work you should be able to easily pass he is upfront about what quizzes are over and midtermsfinal
16585,Stephen  Timmons,i took his online class and pretty sure be the toughest teacher ever have the tests are unbearable his feedback and instructions are unclear he expects things he ask for the tests are long essays and you only have to write them not kidding i recommend him at all
16586,Stephen  Timmons,the workload is a ton usually three assignments which take me a few hours each per week on test weeks you have all of those plus an essay test i even know how many days worth of hours i spent preparing for the tests if up for a difficult course go for it however if you have a pretty bulky schedule i would not recommend it
16587,Stephen  Timmons,this is class is pretty easy but very boring his class lectures are pointless and you need to take notes because they give you no information needed for is a hard grader but i find it hard to believe anyone could fail this class.everything is out of the books and he lets you do all your work at home prior to
16588,Stephen  Timmons,i had him for hist and actually kinda enjoyed his dry humor it is a lot of writing however and he definitely has high standards as far as the work load goes but you know expected of you and he gives you the exam questions ahead of time just try to summarize the answers in your textbook in your own words and be fine
16589,Stephen  Timmons,i thought he was a good teacher not the most friendly though although he is willing to give you many opportunities with late work despite how intimidating he is in the beginning his exams are all essays and the grading is not easy on them make sure you do the quizzes journals and discussions to make up for the midterm grades make an effort
16590,Gene  Singleton,i can recommend him if you just want to pass but if you need to get a and you are not good at speaking in front of ppl i recommend him he is tolerant to pass but intolerant to give a he is always smiley and looks easygoing but the professor who needs result not process overall i like him but i regret i took his class
16591,Gene  Singleton,where else can you find a teacher like him he is the best professor i never had before please chose him as your professor he is the best i guarantee
16592,Gene  Singleton,i found it rare to find a teacher like mr singleton who truly cared that his students not only did well in class but also progressed as members of society a wonderful mentor
16593,Gene  Singleton,i loved this teacher he made the class so interesting and fun i had no interest in taking a speech class but it was a requirement i was so lucky to end up in his class he really lets you know what he thinks but in a nice way the few tests and assignments were easy and fun if every instuctor was like him college would be a breeze
16594,Gene  Singleton,gene was an amazingly entertaining teacher he was light and funny and great to listen to he was passionate about his subject and very forgicing of his students and cute as a button
16595,Sue  Lape,the content covered is very interesting but the way that she tests you over it is not instead of testing over the themes of literature and the impact they had on history you are expected to be able to identify direct quotes there were only grades for the whole semester and one of those was a group project
16596,Sue  Lape,poor grammar for an english teacher confusing requirements for grading says discussion board is due by saturday but also says students who wait until the last minute to post may find their comments for the week will not reach me before the board closes resulting in a zero for that week
16597,Sue  Lape,took the online us literature i course very well organized had the entire semester laid out by the first day which made it easy to plan ahead her weekly outlines were a lot of help as she helped break down the assigned readings i did enjoy being able to pick my own topics for the two essays that were assigned dr lape is great
16598,Sue  Lape,i took her online us literature i course and it was pretty straight forward dr class is well organized she grades essays fast and responds to email in a timely manner there is a lot of reading not too much though but this is a literature course so to be expected
16599,Sue  Lape,american literature after is the second of two classes i took with professor lape this summer i greatly enjoyed this class because she helped me grow as a writer i especially like how she lets students pick the topics of their essays related to the assigned readings and approved by her i would reccomend that anyone take a class with her
16600,Sue  Lape,i took two online classes with professor lape this summer and i wish i could take more i greatly enjoyed this class covering literature participation is in the form of blackboard posts covering that readings papers are returned with great feedback within a few days of submission i became better writer because of her
16601,Sue  Lape,professor lape has been one of my favorite professors ever taken two courses with her and wish i could take more she encourages discussion of different view points and is incredibly supportive the best part is her feedback every paper i turn in is returned promptly which is rare with a grade and in depth feedback throughout my paper
16602,Sue  Lape,professor lape is such a sweet lady she helps you understand the readings the next day you come into class by discussing with everyone there are not many grades attendance does matter to her one group project which could go either way based on the group you choose to be with the exams are a little rough to study for but you do well
16603,Sue  Lape,absolutely loved this class the readings were fun and interesting which created great discussions in our discussion board section mrs lape was a great teacher and always seemed enthusiastic about the different writers and poets we learned about each week the tests are pretty easy as long as you read the weeklies she also gives essays
16604,Sue  Lape,gives very vague instruction assigns a ton of reading have to recognize specific quotations from for exams very unorganized wish i would have dropped the class
16605,Sue  Lape,online summer class syllabus was clear about what was expected essays and exams throughout the entire semester discussion board every week professor lape posts weeklies which are summaries of the chapters required to be read every week gives good feedback on essays lots of reading but easy a if you put in the effort
16606,Sue  Lape,a lit class so there is obviously a lot of reading dr lape does a great job of explaining things she is very easy to get along with participation in discussion is required but she welcomes all thoughts and does not put anybody down she is also funny which makes literature not so boring would take another class by her again
16607,Sue  Lape,i liked the course more than i liked the professor professor lape rarely updated announcements gave no feedback on anything was not professional with her email responses she did not help me much with anything really and she was too subjective with a lot of things the class was pretty easy but she barely did anything all semester
16608,Sue  Lape,i loved this class dr lape does give test but easy if you read the readings i read half the readings and kept up on the weeklies she post which summarized each ready and writer use the weeklies for the test easy to pass if you can readwrite english
16609,Sue  Lape,she is the best teacher i have ever had she gives you a ton of control over your writing assignments and really wants you to find your own writing voice i would definitely take any class of hers i looked forward to english class every week
16610,Sue  Lape,i have taken three of dr classes at cscc now she is a wonderful teacher all of the classes i have taken have been online and dr lape makes instructions clear she grades fairly and offers wonderful feedback on papers i highly recommend her classes i am an english major and her classes have deepened my love of literature top notch
16611,Sue  Lape,lets see for this online class she has made us read about different small readings per week and then is knowing small quotes from all the readings over the past weeks are you kidding me she is a critical grader and unorganized sure nice in person but take online unless the only class you take ridiculous
16612,Sue  Lape,great instructor clear with directions answers emails quickly grades quickly as well she gives feedback on the graded papers in the side notes which were very helpful the papers assigned were interesting a great instructor i would definitely take again do the work read the assigned readings to help writing get an
16613,Sue  Lape,i would not recommend professor lape to people looking to take an online english course not sure how she is in a classroom but online she was confusing unorganized late giving back graded assignments and she did not respond to emails better off to just take her in an actual classroom or not at all
16614,Sue  Lape,dr lape is absolutely the best instructor i have ever had i have had the pleasure of having her for a total of three classes she is upbeat and always gives her students positive feedback i took english online a lot of reading and writing but well worth it she prepares you for the professional world
16615,Duo  Zhang,no comments
16616,Duo  Zhang,the class was boring as hell i got an a and i have no clue how she is just a terrible teacher
16617,Duo  Zhang,easy teacher easy grader plays favorites so at least pretend to pay attention in class and at least once see her in her office
16618,Duo  Zhang,no comments
16619,Duo  Zhang,easy grader
16620,Duo  Zhang,horrible teacher didnt really teach anything repeats herself often tells crazy stories unrelated to class gave term paper and didnt explain any of it dont recomend taking her class
16621,Duo  Zhang,she is one of the best teachers i have ever had she got me interested in economics and now it is my second major
16622,Duo  Zhang,decent teacher and really nice to look at a little bit loopy though likes to go off on a tangent require attendance if you can maintain a b which is easy kinda funny too
16623,Duo  Zhang,very attractive almost distracting helpful and good professor
16624,Duo  Zhang,she is very helpful and seems genuinely want her students to understand the material as long as you pay attention during lecture the tests too difficult besides relatively funny and is one of the best looking teachers had here
16625,Duo  Zhang,good class esp the lab
16626,Duo  Zhang,easy course i love graphs
16627,Duo  Zhang,nice lady but bad teacher does not focus enough on topics that are important for the test loves graphs that are not a big part of test and test are very tricky
16628,Duo  Zhang,she is very helpful and a very nice person however her tests are difficult in the extreme and this class is definitely not an easy a
16629,Duo  Zhang,good teacher a little unstructured in the lectures but much could be gotten from the class always willing to help funny
16630,Duo  Zhang,she went out of her way to help me when i was having troubles with the class great teacher
16631,Duo  Zhang,the class is a hard class compared to other economics instructors that i hear about the test are really hard and very very tricky you have really really memorize and understand the concepts
16632,Duo  Zhang,the only thing that i would change about the class is format of the tests she uses too many mc questions that are worth too much of the grade it would be easier to study if there were a matching or short answer section partial credit
16633,Duo  Zhang,first off one of the most attracive instructors here she have that bad of an accent i can understand her fine class is easy as long as you follow what she teaches use study guides and take notes during class and be fine
16634,Duo  Zhang,needs a more focused lecture and more emphasis on concepts nad terms that ae used and less graphs that mean much with no concepts
16635,David  Perkins,dr perkins is the best professor i have had at acu i am currently a macc student and he still goes back and reviews the basics with us he believes strongly in understanding the fundamentals of accounting his class is not hard if you pay attention in class and do the homework he also makes himself very available to his students
16636,David  Perkins,in order to succeed in this class you must do the homework and read the chapters at least glance the vocabulary the exams are exactly like the study guides he gives with a few questions he also provides tutoring sessions in case a student has trouble in this class
16637,David  Perkins,great teacher helps get one into the understanding of accounting easily in order to succeed you must do the homework although it is not mandatory
16638,David  Perkins,great person
16639,David  Perkins,fantastic guy and great christian the material that he teaches might not be the easiest but he will make sure you get through it if you try and show up to class
16640,David  Perkins,this class is extremely straight forward dr perkins literally wrote the book for this class this means do what he says and you will make an a unfortunately he asks a lot with homework assignments nearly every class however if you just put a little bit of time into the class throughout the semester it will be one of your easiest classes
16641,David  Perkins,perkins is friendly and will certainly help you understand the material he actually wrote the course textbook so the course is very consistent the work itself is very difficult and requires an immense amount of practicememorization to master makes you realize the level of commitment required to go into accounting though
16642,David  Perkins,this class is not as easy as he comes across like it is study all material before test good guy though
16643,David  Perkins,good man
16644,David  Perkins,cool guy easy class but you learn a lot loved it
16645,David  Perkins,awesome dude yes he will drop the i really like what the author did here joke times no it does not get old
16646,David  Perkins,very good teacher he teaches everything very clearly and step by step to make sure you understand it
16647,David  Perkins,dr perkins was great in this course and helped convince me to become an accounting major he expects a lot of each student but is not unreasonable all the answers to the homework are online so a relatively easy course
16648,David  Perkins,great professor who is so knowledgable about accounting he always makes sure students understand new concepts before moving on and is very helpful this is not an easy a type of course but as long as you keep up with homework and reading you can get an a
16649,David  Perkins,good professor
16650,David  Perkins,perkins is the sweetest man ever he explains concepts throughly and is always happy to answer questions the homework answers are posted online and the tests are just like the reviews he gives and goes over in class def take his class if you get the chance
16651,David  Perkins,did not understand well the class because of the language but what he talked in class was not hard the test is not difficult if u do homework even for international students
16652,David  Perkins,very clear and helpful gives homework answers daily to check work very applicable teaching style
16653,David  Perkins,david perkins is a good teacher he cares about his students and is available for help whenever you need him
16654,David  Perkins,no comments
16655,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,i agree with the person who said he was stylish great professor knows his stuff omg though hardest cheg class in the curriculum make sure you go to class and have fun with the final i still have nightmares lol
16656,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,great teacher the class itself is not so great very organized stylish guy explains things really well work load tends to be needlessly heavy and gone for half the semester teacher is good the class itself sucks
16657,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,he is always ahead in lectures so you can easily lose track of the material he is completely disrespectful when answering your questions
16658,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,been a couple of years i took this class from this professor he was the best teacher in the cheg department and the best teacher i had at ud i strongly recommend him
16659,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,yeah hes ok
16660,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,i also agree that he is one of the best cheg professors in the department i love that not only is he knowledged in the material but that he can actually get his point across clearly versus some other cheg professors every class was exciting in some way oh and the best dresser o
16661,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,best professor ever had the only class stayed awake in and actually gone to regularly he is also very friendly outside class and has the coolest accent
16662,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,best professor i have ever had here he should teach the rest of the professors in the engineering department how to lecture
16663,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,he is good at teaching but speeds through material too fast and assigns of pages of readings to fill in the gaps which help on tests subject interesting like the red stripe guy in the commercials
16664,Babatunde  Ogunnaike,no comments
16665,Jonathan  Szura,kinda cute but boring as all hell slept in his class regularly hard class and hard grader avoid
16666,Jonathan  Szura,he is a really smart guy just misunderstood he is a really good teacher for me and i did learn a lot from him he brought in ginko banobo leaves for the topic memory in cognitive processes class and since then whenever i walk by the ginko trees in front of ecc i remember him and his teachings on memory
16667,Jonathan  Szura,took it as a summer class and found it fair in each nonexam day we took a quiz found online that was easy to get in exams were fair the only sucky thing he kept us the entire hours each day we did watch some experiments so the time went by quickly no point in takin notes he everything is from the book
16668,Jonathan  Szura,extremly boring hopefully get better with age his tests are super hard i see this a trend in the psych dept the person under me mustve been in my class cause he really did say that his grading system is the only thing that helped anyone pass the freakin class avoid at all costs
16669,Jonathan  Szura,he give enough time to write down the slides but refuses to put them up on blackboard of not sure of copyright laws he makes things so much more complex than they need to be and his combover distracts the whole class read the book and do fine
16670,Jonathan  Szura,i agreed with the person before me in dr stats class it is much easier you have a lab and instead you have to do online modules he only had exams and were multiple choice and open book
16671,Jonathan  Szura,took him for statistical methods and he was horrible we had a total of tests and lab quizes if it was not for me getting straight in all my quizes in the lab portion of the class i would have failed lecture and lab are each worth i came away a but failed every lecture test stay away take prof hanson instead
16672,Jonathan  Szura,he is absolutely borring i had him for forensic psych and he is borring and hard plus he is a weird professor i do not recommend him
16673,Jonathan  Szura,you will not get a good grade if you do not read the book his lectures make sense however the test covers much more material and in more detail than what he covers in class test do come off a bit confusing if you do not know the material not an easy a class however you can pass without ever attending read the book and you will do well
16674,Jonathan  Szura,as previously stated he is very intelligent and challenges ppl intellectually however because he is so intelligent he makes things more complex than they have to be i do recommend him if you are into thinking and intellecutal growth if you are just up to getting easy then avoid him at all costs
16675,Jonathan  Szura,he is excellent teaches on a college level not out to hold your hand but interested in seeing you be successful and is patient and helpful his exams are tough you have to read any text he uses would take his class again for his interesting methods in teaching very intelligent
16676,Jonathan  Szura,had him for forensic psych class absolutely worst professor ever do urself a favor and do not waste time signing up his class his exams r ridiculous and so are his teaching skills he sux ass and needs to get another hobby
16677,Jonathan  Szura,he does know he stuff however when you think you have the hang of it he makes it confusing he tests are very detail and often difficult not an easy class at all he is nice and tries to help but his test are what kills your grade
16678,Jonathan  Szura,tough teacher very when grading papers must follow structure when composing an essay read the material
16679,Jonathan  Szura,good professor i personally liked his method of teaching people complaint about having to read the book but come on this is college you are expected to read the book
16680,Jonathan  Szura,boring professor who gives out tricky exams and his grading system is unfair his definition of a curve is rounding to
16681,Jonathan  Szura,i have to agree with the people who wrote before me szura is definitely a jerk in last class no one had a average he said the top students were going to get i was in the spot but he gave me a i will never forget what he did to my psychology gpa it went from a perfect to a because of his unfair grading
16682,Jonathan  Szura,let his appearance fool you he may look like a nice guy but his exams are very tricky i knew the book inside out but ended up only with a b highly not recommended
16683,Jonathan  Szura,this guy sucks he reads off some powerpoint slides he has but he tests u on the whole book and then picks the most random stuff to test you on he is def not easy and is extremely boring
16684,Jonathan  Szura,he sucks his exams are very difficult and not clear i took his class because of this website what a mistake if you want to study of the textbook for his exams then good take him but i would not recomend it
16685,James  Cawley,he makesaid class time highly amusing and he is very knowledgeable in the subject area
16686,James  Cawley,honestly professor cawley is a really great professor however in sages the prompts for his papers can be a bit unclear and the grading criteria exactly made clear
16687,James  Cawley,by far my favorite case professor very prone to tangents relating concepts to reallife problems when he first starts explaining a concept it seems a little circuitous but when he finishes his derivations crystal clear what he was going for absolutely brilliant and always loves talking to students in his spare time
16688,James  Cawley,james is a really nice guy who really likes tables that said he is a decent prof class attendance definitely mandatory and he teaches almost straight from the book and is very clear about what will be on exams he had some cute in class experiments too all around definitely a good engr prof
16689,James  Cawley,cawley is a really good professor that knows the material inside and out he is always available and very understanding of students the exams are not easy but that doesnt mean it is impossible to get an a know concepts not formulas read the book and pay attention to his inclass examples go talk to him too during office hours
16690,James  Cawley,he definitely have a clue about how to teach a sages seminar even though you could tell he tried hard he graded papers very oddly and seemed to be evaluating them as if they were scientific journal articles which they certainly were not he was a nice guy but many people in the class felt they came away shortchanged
16691,James  Cawley,excellent advisor mediocre teacher
16692,James  Cawley,while this may have been one of the most boring and dry classes ever had i did learn a lot from him very conceptoriented which i guess you either love or hate and man he loves those steam tables a little too much
16693,James  Cawley,he is alrite but since i was not interested at all in the subject material i was generally bored tests have a lot of multiple choice questions and short answer questions so it is not just solving problems
16694,James  Cawley,extremely boring and dry period
16695,James  Cawley,theres really nothing wrong with him he does teach concepts not plugandchug you can get an a if you just know of formulas covered going in to the exam he has a lot of cool demonstrations and relates material to real life situations that he uses his free time researching for us
16696,James  Cawley,focuses much more on knowledge of concepts then on formulas which can be a refreshing change course feels more like an engineering course then most other engr courses can wander off topic in lectures though and man does he love those steam charts
16697,James  Cawley,no comments
16698,James  Cawley,tests utilize formulas or reflect the homework at all
16699,James  Cawley,you actually have to know the subject to do well in this class which frustrates most people be prepared to learn about fluid flow heat transfer etc and not just how to plugnchug
16700,James  Cawley,he may know the material but he is not very good at communicating it to the class the lectures are unorganized often off the subject the tests are written on the fly and often contain too many realworld examples that are impossible to solve.tas great
16701,James  Cawley,not bad even though i did not like the course material
16702,James  Cawley,no comments
16703,James  Cawley,actually logically proved his lectures to be a waste of my time along with another student pretty helpful tests follow homework and the book
16704,James  Cawley,marks too hard no fair
16705,Andrew  Lesk,certainly got little patience outside of class and very accessible in general but if you do the readings and come to class you can get by easily
16706,Andrew  Lesk,was pretty psyched to take a class on comics and although the material was cool and interesting the experience overall was destroyed by the arrogance he needs to turn down the bravado big time and come down to earth with the rest of ushe is such a turn off omg
16707,Andrew  Lesk,found this professor to be pretty mediocre lectures were a sleep fest consisting mostly of the prof ranting about irrelevant things watch out if you disagree with his opinions cause it will cost you
16708,Andrew  Lesk,really disengaged prof got high regard for his own ideas but little time and patience for anyone who disagrees with him shows very little interest in student success and does not make himself or his accessible for any kind of assistance outside of lecture acts like he want to be there and really care less
16709,Andrew  Lesk,awful professor he uses his lectures as a soapbox for his political views which have nothing to do with the course his expectations on are very unclear and he offers no help whatsoever his essay questions are impossibly hard and when you ask for help he rolls his eyes at you like he be bothered worst prof ever
16710,Andrew  Lesk,prof lesk is the most uncaring arrogant prof i have ever encountered he always thinks he is right and will give you a bad grade if you disagree with his opinions on no matter how well supported his lectures are banal and insights shallow his classes are a waste of time and money
16711,Andrew  Lesk,very very specific about what he wants out of your assignments needs you to pander to his own views to do well in the class leaving not much room for originality and outside perspectives
16712,Andrew  Lesk,i was excited to take his sex in the city one program and the first term was okay but the second he just piggy backed off of the other one program profs and had very little to do with sexual diversity he care for his opinions or mental health and though some of the readings and trips were good an overall disappointment
16713,Andrew  Lesk,the worst professor ever come across in my years at u of t i would give him a but it is not possible right from the get go his ego is apparent he does what suits him and to heck about anyone else because of course the universe revolves around him sad and i pity him save your money and time and take a course with a better prof
16714,Andrew  Lesk,the courses are great for breath requirements and this course was no exception it was a very fun course there were only a few papers and one take home test as long as you gave a solid effort on each assignment it was not hard to get a high mark the material of the course is also very eye opening
16715,Andrew  Lesk,really arrogant and just annoying really easy to get a good grade even though nitpicky
16716,Andrew  Lesk,really open to ideas even when he agree with them he accepted their merit really funny and used real world connections to make class interesting
16717,Andrew  Lesk,i loved sex in the city class would highly recommend this first year seminar the material and field trips were very interesting and lesk clearly knew a lot about the subject matter and added a lot to the overall experience sometimes it was hard to tell what kind of mood he was in which was scary but for the most part a fun prof
16718,Andrew  Lesk,a few of us are currently having a study group for this class right now for the final exam the problem noticed in the midterm is that even though our arguments are fully supported which fulfills the requirement of a good answer as long as he agree with your opinion he will dispute the answer and give it a bad grade
16719,Andrew  Lesk,he is very opinionated and arrogant his ego is through the roof
16720,Andrew  Lesk,i was very excited to take this course as new to the city and very interested in sexual diversity studies however i find the course to often be a waste of time unless we are on a field trip or there is a guest speaker the assignments feel like busywork and i find prof lesk comes off as very arrogant especially towards guests
16721,Andrew  Lesk,the worst anything that contradicts his argument he dismisses as it matter cause just comics then why are you teaching a course on them in one class a girl called him out on taking a quote out of context his response i know but so much more delicious this way great reading list but all avoid him like the plague
16722,Andrew  Lesk,the only way the professor grades you is essays a lot of essays write essays in two hours in class
16723,Andrew  Lesk,hes boring
16724,Andrew  Lesk,prof lesk is an amazing speaker his lectures are clear concise and very interesting he grades fairly but not too rough i think the negative feedback for him on here must mostly be from people who do their readings and consequently got poor marks he put up with offensive opinions but encourages discussion
16725,Ryan G  Vancleave,great guy and professor alot of work but if you do it you will do well in the course
16726,Ryan G  Vancleave,no comments
16727,Ryan G  Vancleave,man van cleave is the greatest professor an extremely nice and laid back guy who will let you know exactly expected the class work really difficult but it does require a lot of creative thought which is way more enjoyable than the garbage you have to do in other classess this class was the oasis of my semester
16728,Ryan G  Vancleave,man van cleave is the greatest professor an extremely nice and laid back guy who will let you know exactly expected the class work really difficult but it does require a lot of creative thought which is way more enjoyable than the garbage you have to do in other classess this class was the oasis of my semester
16729,Ryan G  Vancleave,ryan has a way of teaching that is just right for the english department his students thrive in the environment and the material put out is better because of his influence a great guy wonderful professor i highly recommend van cleave
16730,Ryan G  Vancleave,he made himself very clear in what he expected he allowed the students to have a say in what was done in class and he helped keep me interesting something very hard to do in english
16731,Ryan G  Vancleave,vancleave is the man i took him for a summer class and he is very fun he knows going on in the world and you have a chance for just random talks take him if you can but be sure to read the stories you will discuss them each day in class and he will give you a grade on participation
16732,Ryan G  Vancleave,no comments
16733,Ryan G  Vancleave,best english teacher ever had all you have to do is keep up with the short story assignments and you will get an a you have a quiz about once a week on the stories you readnothing tricky just the basics take him if you can
16734,Ryan G  Vancleave,ryan brings a positve attitude to class everyday and makes poetry enjoyable let alone tolerable he cares about what we have to say and gives us an opportunity to say it URL
16735,Linda  Lubrano,overall a great prof super smart knowledgeable on a wide spectrum of issues fastidiously organized has about a page syllabus always willing to help but can be kind of dense very fair easy several short powerpoint presentation take her worth the work
16736,Linda  Lubrano,i hated this class it was so pointless and she often contradicted herself and the ta gave conflicting information the midterm was easy but the papers are so ambiguous even with her verbose notes in the syllabus and on handouts avoid at all costs
16737,Linda  Lubrano,she is a challenging professor but is incredibly organized and one of the best professors at au if you have questions you have to go to her but then she will do everything she can to help you work out the question if you want an easy a this the class for you but if you truly want to learn how think and create an rd one of the best
16738,Linda  Lubrano,wonderful professor truly insightful on russian politics and society i learned an incredible amount on the subject her lectures are very well organized and full of information she is incredibly open to ideas and inspires us to think in novel ways one of the best professors had take her on russia if you get the chance
16739,Linda  Lubrano,i learned a lot in her class but it was very difficult and she was often unclear about instructions i had to check out books from the library on my own to do her papers pick someone else
16740,Linda  Lubrano,she was much better than i expected you must do the reading and study hard but it will pay off it is not a class you can slack off in and still get a good grade but if you do the work you will get a good one and actually learn a lot much happier with this class than anticipated
16741,Linda  Lubrano,an excellent professor very organized assigns helpful materials and papers she has high standards and the material is tough but not a bad thing at all this class will give you a real challenge and teach you some very useful things just be willing to put in some effort ir research was my most stressful class but also my favorite
16742,Linda  Lubrano,this rating serves to confirm the evaluations of others it doesnt matter how well done in other classes how high your gpa is or how much research done before this class will be useless and annoying take it wait another semester and take it with someone else she is the worst professor i have ever had
16743,Linda  Lubrano,no comments
16744,Linda  Lubrano,worst professor of all time
16745,Linda  Lubrano,trust me on this do not take this woman for this class without a doubt the worst experience of my academic career been warned
16746,Linda  Lubrano,do not have her as a professor she expects yout to know everything with no explanation as to why or its purpose the papers were confusing and unclear at best the final was impossible and pointless unless you wrote down every single word she said throught the semester avoid at all costs
16747,Linda  Lubrano,this class was hell on earth two major papers she outlines them but i still didnt know what she wanted from it then theres the final where you basically have to know everything about anything very stressful class
16748,Linda  Lubrano,horrible do not take this class unclear very boring horrible class
16749,Linda  Lubrano,is not clear on anything until after it is all done with meeting with her outside of class is of little help did not seem to have any sort of grasp on class content had i known what i was in for i would have taken a different class
16750,Linda  Lubrano,extremely difficult two major research papers to do in this class and she explain how to do it until after done at which point already received a bad grade
16751,Mark  Perlman,mark is one of the most influential professors i have ever had i look up to him as a father figure he is extremely knowledgeable and wise very traditional and passionate at what he does
16752,Mark  Perlman,love mark my favorite teacher by far as long as you are good which if you why are you an art major be fine highly recommended
16753,Mark  Perlman,i think mark assumes that art students are here to our asses off that what here for i know you tell me mark is the best professor had in the department positive openminded and helpful pretty old school but he is extremely knowledgeable if he like you you must suck sorry
16754,Mark  Perlman,best class yet at ssu i can see the results of his teaching in my work and in all of my classmates everyone has moved a big leap forward easy personality knows his stuff
16755,Mark  Perlman,discouraging at times
16756,Mark  Perlman,mark does expect a lot out of his students but he just wants you to succeed always there to help and you can learn a lot from him if you choose to do not take this class unless you are interested in painting and have done it before even though the class was hard and timeconsuming it was definitely the best class taken at ssu
16757,Mark  Perlman,his class was very laid back you go in and get to listen to headphones paint have fun with it after each piece you put them up and as a class discuss each one sometimes a bit harsh if he doesnt like your work if you love art take the class its fun relaxed and mark is honest take the class its a nice break from other classes
16758,Mark  Perlman,mark is a good professor he really teaches his classes as opposed to just sitting back i feel learning a lot more in int than i did in beginning different professor
16759,Mark  Perlman,with a habit of cutting to the quick he does expect abit much from the beginners but once you give him time and work with him one on one his methods become a bit clearer and his advice becomes much more sound a special study course with him would be the best bet for truly gaining from his teachings
16760,Mark  Perlman,commented more about the materials i was using than my ability or the piece i was working on an elitest who places too much importance upon the more trivial parts of artwork i.e stretcher bar width or acrylics vs oils and not enough on the actual artwork itself not a very encouraging professor
16761,Mark  Perlman,mark is a very good teacher he may be disparaging about a students work but his feedback is though sometimes harsh is usually right on the money has high expectations but often helps students achieve thouse expectations
16762,Mark  Perlman,taking a class with mark is like baiting a wild bear i wouldnt recommend either prone to fits of rage and disparaging comments hard grader just tells you what to paint and skips the whole how its done part
16763,Mark  Perlman,agree has expectations of advanced painting for beginners class like things painted in pastels likes a specific style of painting if you arent satisfied with a grade he gives you a chance to improve your painting thats nice
16764,Mark  Perlman,grades beginning classes with expectations of advanced very discouraging feedback
16765,Joan  Felt,best spanish professor had she loves her students keeps the class entertained and is a wonderful teacher
16766,Joan  Felt,professor felt is a wonderful teacher had her for tests are really easy and she will explain stuff to you if you understand take her
16767,Joan  Felt,felt is a wonderful teacher and woman if i could have her as my professor for all subjects i would definately do it she gives just the right amount of work and always teaches the subject matter before assigning anything terrific i highly recommend her
16768,Joan  Felt,she is amazing she really knows her subject matter which can make or break a language class dont take any other teacher use the book all the time get tutor if needed lss study frequently a few pop quizzesshe warns you do all your work including charla and lab minutes great communication of knowledge
16769,Joan  Felt,oh felt i just love her she is supper sweet and definitely wants her students to do well sentence translations on tests but she gives practice ones ahead of time not a lot of hw just a workbook that comes with an answer key or oral presentations but pretty easy and she a hard grader take it with her if you can
16770,Joan  Felt,amazing super organized always available when help is needed and very good with email
16771,Joan  Felt,very good professor explains everything well if you need help she will do well at making you understand the concept spanish lab sucks but you have to do it overall pretty amazing
16772,Joan  Felt,amazing professor very thorough i would love to take more classes from her
16773,Joan  Felt,profesora felt rocks she has been one of my favorite professors since my attendance at sonoma she really wants her students to learn the spanish language but also the latin american culture i would most definitely suggest to take her class
16774,Joan  Felt,she was very sweet and would help you if you needed it but her tests were very hard almost all sentence translation so if you arnt good at that then dont take this class
16775,Joan  Felt,pretty easy class some busy work but not alot just go to class and do what they tell ya and be fine
16776,Joan  Felt,professor felt is a great spanish professor she makes every class meeting and every second of class fun and she will teach you spanish highly recommended
16777,Joan  Felt,absolutely loved every second of her class if i could i would take her for every unit of college period profesora felt rocks
16778,Joan  Felt,i loved her she is very patient and willing to go a bit off topic as long as in spanish she is awesome
16779,Joan  Felt,she is fun clear and makes spanish fun if you need help she is always there for you what a sweet woman i hope she doenst get murdered by the ghost of prez nixon boo
16780,Joan  Felt,my favorite profesora in college so far
16781,Joan  Felt,well i found her class difficult she was always out sick and she very clear and she ran class badly
16782,Joan  Felt,good teacher might not be around very long though i hear going to be murdered by the ghost of president nixon
16783,Joan  Felt,i learned a lot from this class joan is very pleasant and really wants her students to do well
16784,Joan  Felt,very enthusiastic she really wants you to learn this stuff so that makes it that much better if in the class
16785,Geri  Olson,this course is a selfdiscovery course so you would imagine for it to involve some degree of creativity she claims to encourage creativity but the truth is that she puts countless restrictions to what you can do in your work during lecture she says the same thing about ten times over and she leaves little room for actual artistic work so ugh
16786,Geri  Olson,geri is a very nice down to earth prof like a sweet grandma there is definitely a lot of work to do but she grades easy as long as you do it show a little effort do fine a little unorganized at times failed to mention in there was a page final memoir paper lots of small group sharing fun artsy class
16787,Geri  Olson,sweet and cares deeply for her students class focused on art therapy so be prepared to do creative things in an art journal grade based on artistic ability just make sure you meet the criteria explained in syllabus takes a while to get papers back but is a generous grader since prompts are vague
16788,Geri  Olson,really sweet but you get your assignments back for months most of the time no tests or anything but several papers projects a page journal and a final page paper complete with an art project incredibly forgetful and often assigns things at the last minute and provides minimal instructions
16789,Geri  Olson,an interesting professor really nice maybe a little strange at times but super down to earth i like the type of work that we do an interesting class a lot of work with personal life stuff but you necessarily need to share lots of creative writing stuff and you keep a dream journal a few small projects too
16790,Geri  Olson,the personality class was great not hard if you do the work the study guides make it so you know expected for the test clear about what she wants the presentations you have a lot of freedom on which i liked as with the final paper not vague you just have a lot of options very helpful lends books and is nice
16791,Geri  Olson,i would not recommend her she rambles incoherently is unprofessional disorganized and condescending on top of all that she is not motivating or inspiring she is depressing definitely not worth the time or money
16792,Geri  Olson,i think great if you are creative enjoy arts and crafts mind doing some self exploration prefer hands on work and like multiple choice tests this is the class for you
16793,Geri  Olson,i loved her energy personally i loved using creativity in journaling she was approachable and great
16794,Geri  Olson,i really enjoyed her class i loved making the journals and the autobiographical writing combined with art so if you like that type of thing the class is great but at parts of the class things did get really repetitive and she had a problem with changing assignments last minute after already completed things which is uncool
16795,Geri  Olson,she is amazing and so so nice almost everyone gets an a in her class literally very easy teacher you would be stupid not to take classes with her
16796,Geri  Olson,classes are very experiential do not take this class if you want lecture and tests and very specific information do take this class if you want to get out of the class what you put into it very hands on with arts and creativity keep an open mind i think younger people may get less from her because learning from her is experiencial
16797,Geri  Olson,awful all you will do is collage and talk about feelings with people you dont know goodness i will not ever take a class from her again shes very unclear about assignments and will never give you a straight answer stay away
16798,Geri  Olson,i will never take her again in addition to the previous accurate complaints she picks favorites and if she like you good luck
16799,Geri  Olson,over the course of the semester this class has turned more into an art class than a psychology class sometimes i feel like she is talking down to us and is pretty set in her own way of doing things i recomend this class for those of you who are more serious about art and enjoy service learning with children
16800,Geri  Olson,runs around like a chicken head cut off
16801,Geri  Olson,very easy hit the pub before class then talk about your feelings way to get an a
16802,Geri  Olson,a kindergarten teacher with a badge
16803,Geri  Olson,i took her in the summer and i loved this class she is such a great teacher i had this class for hours and she made it fly bye she has a way of breaking up the class that makes it bearable
16804,Geri  Olson,sweet lady lots of videos and some art stuff mostly reading from the text and lectures with some group work she assigns a few short easy papers good for ge
16805,Patricia  Renick,very great professor i had her for two classes and she mentored me for my student teaching yes she does get off topic but she has great stories and so much knowledge regarding special needs students her class required writing of reflections for each class
16806,Patricia  Renick,i loved dr class she is so personable and knowledgeable about children with special needs she has the greatest stories and makes class so interesting she is funny and she also keep you in class for the whole hours like some professors do she does require alot of reflections but i least learned something in the process
16807,Patricia  Renick,i loved the class because dr were soo interesting she made us all laugh all of the time she is very flexible and understanding if you are having any personal issues and need to extend an assignments due date by a week she offered to print extra powerpoints for us if we needed them.language module was unclear though
16808,Patricia  Renick,very scattered epitomizes the absent minded professor often repeats herself and weekly lesson due to be unorganized way too much busy work for graduate i have a problem with everyone getting an a if they do the work i worry about the number of grad students being turned out with poor grammar and writing skills barely comparable to h
16809,Patricia  Renick,dr renick has a tendancy to venture off topic but if you truly listen to her lectures you will find that she is an incredibly intelligent professor not the typical egocentric prof for her life experiences allow her to function on a realistic level while maintaining a solid intellectual foundation
16810,Patricia  Renick,the class is a ton of work with a lot of reading and the lectures are kind of boring if you put some effort into the class do fine just try to get on her good side she can be kind of spacey and forgetful at times but not a bad person
16811,Patricia  Renick,lots of experiance
16812,Patricia  Renick,she gave too much busy work her stories were more insightful than anything in the text
16813,Patricia  Renick,this is the worst professor lost my portfolio gave me a b in the class for no reasoni had a b since my freshman year
16814,Patricia  Renick,the most unprofessional professor ever had the misfortune to encounter
16815,Patricia  Renick,has missed classes wastes my time keep office hours loses homework bad bad professor
16816,Patricia  Renick,tells great stories they are more insightful than anything i learned for the text
16817,Patricia  Renick,dr renick has a strict attendance policy but misses classes regularly herself in addition she is never in her office during her scheduled office hours
16818,Patricia  Renick,dr renick is the best professor she knows her subject and explains everything very well very fair
16819,Patricia  Renick,knows her topic the best
16820,Burga  Jung,very unclear about her expectations of assignments and rambles on in class never coming to a point her helper that came to class had to interpret everything after burga said it
16821,Burga  Jung,snore explains assignments better after you get them back covered in red ped but is definitely willing to accept revisions
16822,Burga  Jung,all i have to say is good luck staying awake
16823,Burga  Jung,in tune with her topic great expeditor
16824,Sharon  Hardesty,easiest class ever taken easy a a good professor too
16825,Sharon  Hardesty,she is the sweetest woman who really understands her students and gets that not everyone is interested in sociology but has to take it to graduate easy going and she will work with you as long as you communicate with her she knows her stuff and she explains it well she has her own ideas but genuinely hears her students out take her
16826,Sharon  Hardesty,great professor i took the class online and she was very clear on all assignments she was quick to respond to emails and provided feedback on assignments easy if you do the work
16827,Sharon  Hardesty,took her online very easy class and as long as you participate you are golden the only problem i really had was the discussion boards because it seemed that she just gave you whatever she felt she wanted to at the time it worked out for me though she usually quick to respond if i had a question overall i say definitely take her
16828,Sharon  Hardesty,i took this class in the fall last year and i am looking forward to taking her online this fall she is awesome she genuinely cares about her students and is always available and willing to help
16829,Sharon  Hardesty,took this class online not a lot of points taken so you have to keep up with your work read a chapter post on discussion board come back or times after that to get the full points for the week along with points of that being just an opinion you submit to her one research paper midterm and final not too difficult interesting class
16830,Sharon  Hardesty,great teacher i took this class online hardesty gives lots of extra credit and is very helpful i plan on taking her for soc
16831,Sharon  Hardesty,ms hardesty is awesome this class is a breeze and the only really big assignment is the group project other than that it is notes and tests she is so nice and helpful she is hilarious also she hardly ever has class on friday
16832,Sharon  Hardesty,she is one of my favorite professors she is easy going amusing super nice and her classes are not very hard if you show up and listen to the lecture you will pass this class she gives study guides and spends a day reviewing before the tests she shows videos sometimes and allows for some class time to work on the one project she assigns
16833,Sharon  Hardesty,really easy to get along with tests are super easy she gives study guides she will clarify anything you want to movies alot and she keeps the class intresting and takes attendence sometimes
16834,Sharon  Hardesty,take this teacher she is really great she makes a dull subject interesting take good notes and the tests will be no problem i did not even open my text book she gives reviews of everything on the test take this teacher for soc
16835,Sharon  Hardesty,she is super sweet and is very willing to work with you great class
16836,Sharon  Hardesty,sweetest woman on earth super easy class
16837,Sharon  Hardesty,it is a pretty easy class she gives you exactly what you need to know on the tests as long as you attend class and take good notes you will pass the class
16838,Sharon  Hardesty,shes easy and funny definitely reccomend
16839,Sharon  Hardesty,great teacher very funny and easy to talk to i have her for soc right now you need a book unless you want to read more in detail otherwise she writes everything you need to know on the board she takes attendance randomly but if you go to class you get the notes anyway
16840,Sharon  Hardesty,professor hardesty is a really easy professor she is easy to understand she require you to get a textbook and she cracks some pretty funny jokes i took this class as a gened and now i think sociology is great
16841,Sharon  Hardesty,hardesty is funny and her classes are straightforward and to the point write down what she writes down and you will ace the tests i never studied and i am getting an a if you can relate to the material or memorize you will do well you need a book well i use one
16842,Sharon  Hardesty,bother with the book you use it everything you need to know is given in lecture and written on the board very easy class if you take notes easy to talk to answers questions willing to help you
16843,Sharon  Hardesty,i think she was a good professor at all she help you out what so ever and she says umm wayy too much which makes you not be able to stand her for too long dont take her
16844,Lisa  Kennedy,used point system to get an a we needed pts she offered pts tests and must get to consider getting a no final small quizzes in between not required but if you want pts then take it you can fail the quizzes and it wont matter bc its point based posts ppt lectures after class i did so much extra work than i needed to
16845,Lisa  Kennedy,very passionate about what she teaches have to buy tophat for participation point based system to get an a you have to get points she offered points her quizzes are online but very short in so no time to use very easy to get a if you just pay attention
16846,Lisa  Kennedy,a really good lecturer and keeps the class interesting attendance mandatory but you can get extra credit for it a good class but you definitely do have to study a good amount for the exams skip class
16847,Lisa  Kennedy,good teacher who gives extra credit or times a semester for simply attending class you have to do well on the test because they are of your grade but the test material is fairly easy and simplified great teacher in my opinion
16848,Lisa  Kennedy,for a science class this thing rocks learn lots about how the world works and some stuff to take home too like build your house on a floodplain really pretty interesting stuff and she brings it down to level
16849,Lisa  Kennedy,great class and not hard makes the material real by giving lots of real life examples lots and lots of slides keep it interesting
16850,Lisa  Kennedy,very easy class powerpoint notes make it even easier to pass the test and also make the class more interesting
16851,Lisa  Kennedy,no comments
16852,Sally  Paulson,dr p is my favorite teacher at tech took her for both virology and med vet ent shes a great teacher and the classes arent too hard take okish notes and fill out the study guides she provides you for the exams and easily get a b or a another cool things is she never requires text books for any of her classes so shes a money saver
16853,Sally  Paulson,going to class was really important for filling in the study guides and notes she provided if you studied those the class was pretty easy it was a little boring but definitely not bad she gives extra credit quizzes can be taken an unlimited amnt of times that were worth up to extra points for our grade good class

16872,Jane  Dunn,she uses a lot of real world connections to help apply biology to nonmajors overall pretty interesting class tests are a little difficult though
16873,Jane  Dunn,will bend over backwards to help a student
16874,Jane  Dunn,dr dunn is an amazing professor she wont give you the class on a silver platter but when all is said and done you will be very grateful heres a hint she emails the slideshows to you so take notes on what she says not whats on the slide also make sure you ask questions it will help you remember i promise
16875,Jane  Dunn,very smart and nice lady she gets students excited about the subject must study hard though
16876,Jane  Dunn,hard dont take her unless your really good in biology she is a very nice lady though
16877,Jane  Dunn,great instructor
16878,Jane  Dunn,this was the hardest teacher i ever had i studied my butt off and still didnt understand her or pass the test she doesnt put what you study on the test
16879,Jane  Dunn,dr dunn rox
16880,Jane  Dunn,dr dunn is a great professor really challenging if you put forth an effort do fine but if you attend and study expect to get any grade other than what you deserve really helpful if you have any questions but she help you if you try
16881,Jane  Dunn,this class was very difficult to me she went over her notes and just read them i felt like i didnt get enough explaination for the stuff she was teaching only grade she gave during that class was our test grades so be prepared
16882,Jane  Dunn,i wish i would have had her for the classroom part because i enjoyed her lab so much if you come to class do your work and maybe crack a book every once in a while you will pass she was also very helpful
16883,Jane  Dunn,is this woman really a teacher or is this some sick joke that was played on me do not take this class because you will regret it
16884,Jane  Dunn,she was really hard but she tried to help as much as she could
16885,Jane  Dunn,her class is hard there is no homework the only grades are tests if you suck at taking tests and rely on homework dont take her she is a really sweet person though
16886,Jane  Dunn,no comments
16887,Jane  Dunn,class is difficult but very enjoyable
16888,Jane  Dunn,dr dunn is a great person and teacher but her class is not an easy a do your homework and get behnd you must study study study and not at the last minute she is willing to help anyone willing to help themselves
16889,Jane  Dunn,i love dr d
16890,Jane  Dunn,dr dunn is a great teacher but her class is no walk in the park you really have to study and do your homework or you just stay afloat in her class
16891,Jane  Dunn,no comments
16892,Travis  Langley,even though we are slightly past midterms i have thoroughly enjoyed his class when i decided to take his class many people told me not to take it but he is very personable the best way to pass his class is to write down on the board and then refer back to the book to take more in depth notes i will definitely be taking his class again
16893,Travis  Langley,amazing brilliant professor who challenges you to learn tells you exactly what to do let idiots monopolize class time i wish more professors would shush the narcissists like that very concerned for students while pushing you to use your brain make it work and improve your ability to figure things out for yourself
16894,Travis  Langley,it is evident that he is smart in class but oneononehe is terrible obnoxious he does play favorites in class an instructor should never make a student feel stupid if we knew everything there would be no need to even take classes he has a huge attitude problem
16895,Travis  Langley,i had langley for abnormal psychology and honestly its not hard if you do the work just make sure and study whatever he writes on the board show up for class and do your online assignments people who say this class is hard didnt put in the effort to pass because im a c or b student and i walked out with an a but never missed a class or assignment
16896,Travis  Langley,loved the class very interesting material dr langely is very funny and entertaining easy a if you show up to class and take notes
16897,Travis  Langley,took him for an online class learn anything relevant to the subject only thing i learned how to make a wiki page which never use again he assigned useless assignments a day including weekends had to call his secretary several times for help because he would never return emails beyond unorganized not helpful at all
16898,Travis  Langley,his classes are totally unorganized horrible to try to take notes from his lectures
16899,Travis  Langley,one of the smartest professors i ever saw i really like that he tries to make sure not wasting our time he wants questions but not the attentionseekers who just want to hear themselves talk he can come across like a hardass to keep slackers in line but he tells you exactly what you need to study he wants you to succeed very funny.awesome
16900,Travis  Langley,love dthe class dr langley is a very effective lecturer
16901,Travis  Langley,no comments
16902,Travis  Langley,he is a nutcase but awesome his courses are very interesting
16903,Travis  Langley,no comments
16904,Travis  Langley,grad i honestly used a lot of the info from his courses in my masters and for my psychology license i really appreciated how he fill up class time with bs and actually provided practical material
16905,Travis  Langley,dr langley an amazing professor i always found his sense of humor well humorous and enjoyed the way he weeded out the notsobright individuals in our classes he is the reason i graduated from college
16906,Travis  Langley,he is an okay teacher take notes and study them he tests from what notes he gives in class unless your in forensic psych he can be a jerk so try to stay on his good side most people dont like him but as far as learning goes hes it he knows his field sometimes he thinks he knows everything but like i said stay on his good side or he can m
16907,Travis  Langley,this was one of the most useful classes i have ever taken it helped me learn the great variety that the field has to offer dr langley is smart and funny he rewards effort he does not play favorites although he certainly puts lazy students in their place trying to teach them to get their act in gear now before they go out in the real world
16908,Travis  Langley,i did not learn very much in this particular class with dr langley we had daily assignments in which we repeated the same things over and over there was a lot of information in our textbooks for the class that i would have enjoyed really going into but we never did other than in class presentations i did not like the way the class was taugh
16909,Travis  Langley,hilarious teacher very knowledgable in his area of study
16910,Travis  Langley,well i think hot apparently the only one oh and his teaching is alright too
16911,Travis  Langley,one of the most interesting classes i have ever taken i really appreciated that he let idiots in the classroom get up on soapboxes and waste all our time at the same time he really helped us learn to think about the material it was work and fun
16912,Ica  Manas-Zloczower,awesome class manas is a firstrate professor she is a bit intimidating because of her superior knowledge and her great style sense the content is hard but doable if you read the help from friends
16913,Ica  Manas-Zloczower,one of the best professors she makes it very easy to understand the complex material in the class the homework is really hard but the tests are really easy
16914,Ica  Manas-Zloczower,dr manas is probably one of the best professors had she actually expects us to you know learn and apply things her classes are extremely complex but genuinely cares about her students and wants them to understand the material
16915,Ica  Manas-Zloczower,excellent professor goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands the material that mean easy
16916,Ica  Manas-Zloczower,she knows her a freaking math genious to boot she really wants you to understand the material and is always very helpful and is more than willing to reexplain for clairity she also realizes that the material is extremely complicated so she makes the tests easy
16917,Martin  Halpern,this class is beyond difficult and he is really boring i do not recomend this professor to anyone
16918,Martin  Halpern,do not take him
16919,Martin  Halpern,mr halperns assignments where not to hard but when it comes to mid term and final time consider yourself sol on the meager notes that he provides you
16920,Martin  Halpern,definitely my favorite professor ever had the work is easy and everything is beyond interesting he knows his history without a doubt he was very open to discussion and opinions he uses history books like ella journal to guide his class he explains things so clear take lots of notes absolutely loved this class
16921,Martin  Halpern,a m.ed and ph.d later still by far one of the least interesting professors had
16922,Martin  Halpern,i hated this class i have never not liked a professor but i cannot stand this man if you have any conservative values run all he does is talk about how horrible conservatives are and how wonderful liberals are even when you can prove him wrong he will ignore any arguments against his teaching unfortunately i type enough for stories
16923,Martin  Halpern,i like prof halpearn because if you wanted to get an a in the class you could i was border line an a and he let me do a book review for bonus on a topic i was interested in that boosted me to an a he grade very hard and since him a lot of professors i have had just grade by quizzes and tests so there is no extra credit
16924,Martin  Halpern,boring condescending and all he ever does is talk about black history and how horrible southerners are he has no concept of southern history you cannot argue with him at all he is right period
16925,Martin  Halpern,he is hard study if you take his class
16926,Martin  Halpern,the worst class ever
16927,Martin  Halpern,no comments
16928,Martin  Halpern,he is so dull and he has several very distracting little ticks i really like history but he was just too much i highly discourage anyone from taking any of his classes
16929,Martin  Halpern,very knowledgeable
16930,Martin  Halpern,no comments
16931,Holtman,zz
16932,Holtman,jesus this man is boring if you like being treated like then by all means take this class
16933,Holtman,one word boring bring your pillow to class
16934,Holtman,i would rather watch paint dry it would be more exiting than having to sit through his preschool style lecture
16935,Holtman,this guy makes ben stein look interesting sit behind someone big so you can sleep undetected
16936,Richard  Shanks,passive aggressive treat students with respect and is more of a dictator instead of a mentor
16937,Richard  Shanks,not a good teacher passive aggressive very rude snarky take his class honestly the worst person ever met
16938,Richard  Shanks,felt more like an art director than a teacher very different from the other conceptual brains at saic runs an ad agency so i guess its fitting class was dull and did not move forward at all very arrogant and moody person glad to have found the amazing women of viscomm much more passion from them
16939,Richard  Shanks,i love how teachers talk nice about themselves on this site lol
16940,Richard  Shanks,good job
16941,Richard  Shanks,this is agood instructorthe best one teaching type the others are dull and boring u can tell he really cares about and knows type and design and yeah a little hot kinda strict about getting work done and hates excuses but its usually managable really learned alot how to work with type and be a good desniger
16942,Richard  Shanks,changed how i see type very inspiring hard teacher takes attendance like it when people put his class at top of priorities
16943,Richard  Shanks,great teacher hot hot hot slackers need not apply
16944,Richard  Shanks,very help insturctor made me see and think about ype different i became more interested in design because of his insites he assigns alot but the homeowrk is manageable and the projects are usually interesting
16945,Richard  Shanks,a tough instructor but the best one other istructors at this school really teach youthey tell you what to do to fix a project or improve something i got great advice on how to improve my projects i really learned in this class
16946,Richard  Shanks,excellent instructorthe best ever had the projects were fun and i learned a lot about designin other classes i feel like i learn about design his critism is direct and honest if your lazy or make excuses all the time he like that this instructor is excellent
16947,Richard  Shanks,justabovesoso designer enforcing his opinions as well as some pretty insightful comments always has a kind word for the deserving but dont bother with anything less
16948,Richard  Shanks,yes evil the worst teacher has no respect for the student if he is angry he just leave the class and do not return then spend next class yelling at us instead of helping us swear a lot mark up our works very cocky think he is the best waste of
16949,Richard  Shanks,an evil evil man loves to swear and yell at the class but try too hard nothing is good enough anyway thinks a good dresser ha
16950,Cora  Nohrden,perfect teaching
16951,Cora  Nohrden,she have a lot of experience and it is hard to hear her even if sitting infront.i had a hard time in her class but she gives some extra credit students should ask many questions about each problem
16952,Cora  Nohrden,take it from someone who usually likes their professors this student made me want to quit college completely unfair grading very unclear is not confident in her teaching abilities she gave me a c i give her the finger
16953,Cora  Nohrden,the material in this class is soo simple but people will waste time with dumb questions that she just explained i would say that the students mess this class up not the teacher
16954,Cora  Nohrden,sorry but this woman does not know how to teach just a graduate student so dont expect much from her the class is pretty easy but if you take this teacher better off reading the book and teaching yourself
16955,Cora  Nohrden,i would definitely recommend taking her class she realy knows her stuff and is pretty kick back tests and quizzes were challenging so go to class
16956,Cora  Nohrden,quizzes almost every week but i would recommend taking nohrden she is a good teacher
16957,Cora  Nohrden,no comments
16958,Charles  Lippy,very theologically liberal narrow minded let him know if you disagree with his opinions he will explode not a great teacher either explosive temper
16959,Charles  Lippy,no cell phones in class never forget to turn it off or he will bust you a new one be late he is not easy but he knows his stuff
16960,Charles  Lippy,do not be late to class if you are going to be late just go to the uc get your feelings hurt if you walk in late papers must include what he wanted you to talk about even though he clarify this before you turned it in grading is not fair just says to try harder next time read all the text book and understand it for test
16961,Charles  Lippy,he knows his stuff good class if you are interested in the subject but if just taking to get credit it could be a pain
16962,Charles  Lippy,great teacher for new testament but its not easy to make an a
16963,Charles  Lippy,avoid this man at all costs his tests are essays which he grades according to his opinions and what he thinks is important no extra credit and no makeups cell phones are the devil to him and be late he will freak out on you
16964,Charles  Lippy,overall just a complete jerk rude to students and anyone elses view that differs from his is wrong
16965,Charles  Lippy,i agree he is a very angry man dont have your cellphones on during his class he freaks out dont look at anything else in his class eiter take notes on what he is saying or just look around he will freak out about that as well there is a lot of reading material but he doesnt like to give tests
16966,Charles  Lippy,he is an angry angry man but he is smart he knows everything about the subject but he just teach he born to teach simple as that he hates being interrupted and will literally yell if he is disturbed be late but i advise that you take someone anyone else
16967,Charles  Lippy,tests are very hard there is alot of reading material but the essays are not hard to do what saved my grade he is pretty easy to work with he is willing to have meetings before you begin your essays he even dropped all the tests except the final just kept the essays be willing work
16968,Charles  Lippy,knows a great deal about his subjects but seems to expect the students to know as much as himself not very sympathetic or helpful ever let your cell phone go off in class either he goes crazy
16969,Charles  Lippy,yippee for lippy i loved the class most teachers are shy about saying what they think and making their views the centerpiece but dr lippy told us where he stood and even tried to talk us into agreeing with him i respect that
16970,Charles  Lippy,i loved dr lippy he really encouraged me to think outside the box and we had a ton of class discussion which made the course really interesting he wanted us to learn on our own then share what we learned and our opinion on it
16971,Charles  Lippy,hard
16972,Charles  Lippy,no comments
16973,Charles  Lippy,he treats you like you are in elementry school he grades tests and papers according to his views he is extremely unfair
16974,Charles  Lippy,professor lippy seems to be a brilliant individual and he really knows the material professor lippy however lacks the ability to communicate that material to his students he is very difficult to deal with and tends to get angry easily
16975,Charles  Lippy,really challenges you to consider the material

16977,Karen  Everage,work was easy in class and ridiculously hard outside of it
16978,Karen  Everage,loved mrs.everage if you took ap calc in high school this will simply be a refresher course if struggling though always more than willing to help you so go to those help sessions she offers use and abuse the online egrade practice quizzes
16979,Karen  Everage,funny just have to study a lot
16980,Karen  Everage,if ur the type of student that needs to learn to understand a subject and nt just memorize good for u the flaw is that she moves quickly but if u keep up on egrade b fine go to class u get extra points.go to her if u need helpful i do the hw only the practice before the quizzes tests got an a with no problem
16981,Karen  Everage,ms everage is the most helpful sweet woman i had to take college algebra and i am not a math person so the material was so difficult for me to grasp i went to her office hours so many times and she was so determined for me to pass the class great teacher and person in general you are lucky if you get her as a teacher
16982,Karen  Everage,great teacher not very good at math and the material was challenging lectures go kinda fast but she always offers her time to help go to class because she gives daily points for being there and it really helps to go once a week she holds an optional hour long study session which really helps with test and quizzes
16983,Karen  Everage,this class was a difficult class and you have to work for good grades on the tests but she is an amazing teacher she cares a lot about her students and is so nice if you approach her through email or in person i had to go to her office hours for extra help but when i did she was very helpful lots of quizzes to cushion your grade love her
16984,Karen  Everage,she is an amazing professor she is so enthusiastic and really cares about her students i loved getting up every morning and going to class i recommend trying to go to every class because she moves quickly which is the only bad thing if you miss one day it is possible you could be a little lost but she is extremely helpful
16985,Karen  Everage,probably one of the worst teachers you will ever have you will have to attend tutoring or use videos because this woman teach to save her life her notes are crazily disorganized so when time to take the practice test you have no clue where to look if you get her as a teacher good luck
16986,Karen  Everage,this professor is the nicest old lady i have ever seen however i cant learn she really teach she simply goes over the problems as we watch
16987,Karen  Everage,mrs everage is the sweetest lady ever she is very helpful and cares great deal about her classes do not buy the textbook you will not use it once make sure to go to class everyday you will get points on some days just for showing up if you keep up with the online homework everyday you will do well
16988,Karen  Everage,mrs everage is the sweetest lady ever she is very helpful and cares great deal about her classes do not buy the textbook you will not use it once make sure to go to class everyday you will get points on some days just for showing up if you keep up with the online homework everyday you will do well
16989,Karen  Everage,i had her for summer c at fsu it was ridiculously fast paced and i got lost since she is very hard to follow i ended up relying on the videos that blackwelder put up on her website if you can take blackwelder instead but if you are very sharp and attentive and do the online homework religiously then you should be fine
16990,Karen  Everage,fast pace but she is very passionate about what she teaches she is very helpful always willing to answer questions students have before and after class gives extra credit most days for coming to class do online homework it really really helps even if you know the material already do not buy the book never ever use it
16991,Karen  Everage,this professor was very hard to follow her lectures were all over the place and did not specify what actually was needed to be learned for the tests and quizzes had to get a tutor to explain some of the material i would not recommend taking her if you prepared to teach yourself
16992,Karen  Everage,great teacher make sure you go to class as she randomly takes attendance and gives you extra credit points very clear with her lectures teaches kinda fast but always has helpful homework posted
16993,Karen  Everage,she is so sweet but if you get on her bad side she can be really intense she goes fast at times but over all she is a good teacher she reallyy cares about her job and her students she can seem kinda crazy if you appreciate her humor warning never leave class before its over unless you get permission before class to do so
16994,Karen  Everage,if you are a fast thinker in math she is the best if not do not take her she is a sweet old lady but man she whizzes through everything so quickly inside of class and outside of it she goes way too fast and i was always lost if you think fast in math take her class
16995,Karen  Everage,a good professor but she uses so many long metaphors to explain things do not come to class for attendance and leave without letting her know first seen her chase people out of class to get their names also buy the book and you will never ever use it not once
16996,Karen  Everage,she is extreamly nice she will help you out as much as you need it if you are failing the class or falling behind it is because you dont pay attention in class or do the homework she is a great teacher and doing well in the class and not that great at math
16997,Stephane  McLachlan,great prof he knows his stuff very well.not an easy a though but you will learn a lot he makes you to think out of the box i will recommend him he is a marxist very fair prof
16998,Stephane  McLachlan,great professor and really moves away from text book reading and regurgitating plan to do a lot of handson type learning and discussion brings in great guest lecturers who all have great points of view
16999,Stephane  McLachlan,good teacher though it does feel like trying to brainwash you sometimes to believing his point of view raises interesting point i thought of a lot of work be prepared
17000,Stephane  McLachlan,very unique approach in teaching great prof very knowledgable very interested in opinions alot of work required in this course internships are a tough experience u are literally on your own good experience though
17001,Stephane  McLachlan,hippie
17002,Stephane  McLachlan,super nice guy the class is a ton of work and unfortunately a huge emphasis on group projects
17003,Stephane  McLachlan,i really enjoyed this class and the professor one of the best classes taken at the u of m alot of work though so be prepared
17004,Stephane  McLachlan,very helpful interested in individual students their opinions
17005,Stephane  McLachlan,no comments
17006,Skip  Sedivec,i was an exercise science major with the lifelong dream of attending medical school and eventually becoming the first md in my family well i went by his office several times about what i could do outside of my academia to improve my chances of entry and to my surprise he told a different answer each visit reminds of a indescisive woman
17007,Skip  Sedivec,the devil incarnate right now i can already tell you he hates you evil avoid at all times
17008,Skip  Sedivec,pretty good
17009,Skip  Sedivec,for a level class he expected you to perform at a year grad level class it was ridiculous very boring very general in teaching but superspecific in testing do not take for lab extremely ridiculous in grading the labs do take him for very easy but not for animal phys
17010,Skip  Sedivec,i felt like he taught in a general sense and tested on a much more specific basis i do not like his teaching method
17011,Skip  Sedivec,very helpful i was not even supposed to be advised by him just showed up for some help and he was available above and beyond some wish to complain about hard work and too many classes but they are premed if you cannot take hard undergrad courses at once you will not survive med school
17012,Skip  Sedivec,if you are majoring in bio by all means take him but if not stay clear like one said before he teaches at one level and expects you to know it at a much higher leve
17013,Skip  Sedivec,skip is super hot and lots of fun his class is not hard at all you should take it
17014,Skip  Sedivec,he is kinda boring but if you do the study guide that is half the test he is really nice and will help you if you go to his office he always want people to come see him and makes himself very available good guy
17015,Skip  Sedivec,some may never go to medical school but rather than guide and help he discourages and tells you that you have a chance find someone else if you want help and advice or do it yourself he reserves real effort for those who are a sure bet to get in
17016,Skip  Sedivec,he is not that bad at all bio is a class you have to study for bottom line he gives you study questions that are on the test he is a nice guy just study the outlines and you will do fine
17017,Skip  Sedivec,doesnt know his not sayin this apparently u think failing this class.u prolly never took so many damn classes at the same time or else u would know how much work is involved if u cant take criticism website is not for u.peace
17018,Skip  Sedivec,worst prof i have ever had reads off p.p and doesnt teach the concepts test are hard si himself said to me he teaches at one level and expects you to know at a much higher one class is boring and i got nothing more out of the course then
17019,Skip  Sedivec,great teacher he gives outlines with every chapter and review questions before the tests he presents his information on power point making the lectures easy to follow study hard and do great
17020,Skip  Sedivec,contrary to most this guy is a great adviosor but puts thing to the point which is great all of you who are dissin him as an advisor are prolly just failing and he told u that u aint gonna be a doctor
17021,Skip  Sedivec,the worst advisor you will ever find.supposedly the chair of the premed department but doesnt know anything.he told me to take botany and zoology at the same time with other subjects and wanted me to take stats all at the same time crazy person
17022,Skip  Sedivec,no comments
17023,Skip  Sedivec,no good
17024,Skip  Sedivec,very helpful teacher with good intentions but boring as crap hands out notes so theres no need to go to class except he takes attendence and then makes you sit in class while he reads the notes to you boring test are hard
17025,Skip  Sedivec,i think he might be the only one that takes attendence most people study for other classes during his class can pass if you go to study sessions sure there are better though
17026,Bruce  MacMurray,not a great prof for lart class the class is required and not very interesting to begin with he takes it more seriously than most of the other professors and mostly talks the entire time
17027,Bruce  MacMurray,still unsure whether it was the prof or the curriculum but this class was pretty disappointing we talked in circles rarely made references to the assigned readings were expected to do long writing assignments with little lead time and the semester project was frustrating have to push yourself to get something from this course
17028,Bruce  MacMurray,great prof
17029,Bruce  MacMurray,hard course good basics study
17030,Bruce  MacMurray,ugh this class is gay damn requirements
17031,Bruce  MacMurray,just talk in class and do fine
17032,Bruce  MacMurray,i had a hard time with this profhe seemed arrogant unconcerned and would not bend over grading that seemed unfair
17033,Bruce  MacMurray,hot
17034,Bruce  MacMurray,no comments
17035,Rick  Repetti,absolutely one of the best professors i have ever had he makes you feel like what you have to say is important and valid no matter what the case may be if he had not given me such a good impression i would have no further interest in philosophy he gives very fair tests does a great job preparing you for it and is considerate with his grades
17036,Rick  Repetti,he seems nice and outgoing there were quizzes almost every day the final was hard and it required remembering everything
17037,Rick  Repetti,rick repetti is simply the best instructor for core he is nice gives a midterm final and asks everyone to present one of their beliefs in front of the class he is a easy grader and does not fail anyone there are also no research papers
17038,Gerald  McCausland,this course is absolutely a difficult course regardless of the professor you have if not invested in learning russian then gerry is not the professor for you he is brutally tough but he is an excellent teacher and makes sure that you learn russian correctly and to a good level of proficiency
17039,Gerald  McCausland,i promise you be thankful for his strict teaching method actually necessary for him to teach in such a way it helps you understand the language at the most vital stage so thankful he instilled fear in me to make sure my work was done and vocab was memorized people who appreciate it deserve to learn russian
17040,Gerald  McCausland,gerry is a seriously rude individual and he expects you to know how to understand fluent russian from day he speak english in class the pace of the class is also fast and demanding for an elementary language course
17041,Gerald  McCausland,jerry is tough he expects a lot of you and will not tolerate slacking however if you put in the effort you will learn a ton he has a truly impressive grasp of the language and is extremely clear if you really want to learn russian and mind a challenge take him
17042,Gerald  McCausland,you have to have interest in the subject with jerry if you do your work he will get on your case if you do what you have to do be fine also a funny guy and loves if you show a passion for your work
17043,Gerald  McCausland,intermediate russian is definitely challenging he expects a lot from his students and the pace is pretty quick you do most of the learning from the textbook go over assigned work in class to clarify class is almost all in russian requires a lot of studying effort homework every night class participation
17044,Gerald  McCausland,classes are tough he expects a lot from his students but is very knowledgeable about all things russian he gives you all you need to know in lecture so take a lot of notes do the readings to participate of your grade tests are a crap shoot of what will be there but if you attend class take good notes study you can do well
17045,Gerald  McCausland,if you are a beginner stay away mean demeaning and impossibly hard take his class only if torture is your style
17046,Gerald  McCausland,gerry is mean demanding unhelpful and ridiculously hard for an entry level course try to avoid him if you can
17047,Gerald  McCausland,horrible teacher run run run have all his marbles
17048,Gerald  McCausland,a little intimidating at first but you get used to his style he throws alot at you and expects you to pick it up quickly the course was difficult at first but got easier when i got used to his style definitely read the books and go to class
17049,Gerald  McCausland,very intimidating and impatient would not recommend him for beginners
17050,Gerald  McCausland,very smart guy has a truly impressive grasp on the language for a nonnative speaker very difficult though and kind of mean he can be rude and expects too much in my opinion if you have to take russian with him you will certainly learn a lot but i recommend choosing someone else if possible
17051,Gerald  McCausland,a little strange he barked at us the first day but a really good teacher and he is very good at explaining concepts in ways that american students will understand oral exams are really hard and expected to know a lot of vocab but the chapter tests are really simple just do the hw and be prepared for class and you will do fine
17052,Gerald  McCausland,gerry was pretty much awesome the class was am monday to friday and i never thought about sleeping through it take him if you can
17053,Gerald  McCausland,by the time in russian iv more is expected of you and once he knows you can do it treat you with a good deal of respect seems almost obsessed with covering more ground than just the textbook and is focused on all aspects of russian from pronunciation to paragraph structure great foreign language professor definite recommendation
17054,Gerald  McCausland,he was a great professor he definitely knows what doing like everyone else says he can be harsh but its definitely well deserved if you do what supposed to and just make an attempt to participate find that you have no problems with him overall his class is extremely amusing and he may just be my favorite professor
17055,Gerald  McCausland,terrific teacher would recommend to anyone
17056,Gerald  McCausland,gerry is seriously my favorite teach ever if you like him probably because kind of boring and lamecity i was not a particularly great student gerry grades very harshly but he was very encouraging and personable i got many bunk grades in his class but because i was kind of a up in my opinion he knows
17057,Gerald  McCausland,his command of russian is excellent for a nonnative speaker and he is a very effective recitation instructor however he has a very harsh personality which takes some adjustment
17058,Chris  Fernando,the only thing i do not like about this teacher is that it is hard to understand what he is saying you have to pay attention closely and ask a lot of questions becuase you get lost in what he is saying either he teach very well or maybe i just keep up with him he likes to skip around in the text book
17059,Chris  Fernando,fair teacher not bad to take
17060,Chris  Fernando,not nearly as bad as heard
17061,Chris  Fernando,goes very slow so he wont leave anyone who puts forth any effort behind
17062,Chris  Fernando,no comments

17065,Kimiko  Manes,epic
17066,Kimiko  Manes,sensei is so awesome i look forward to this class so much like i wanted spring break to end so i could come back to class a very interactive class and you definitely learn a lot just make sure you come to class and do all the homework
17067,Kimiko  Manes,awesome
17068,Kimiko  Manes,sensei manes is great she makes class fun despite the inevitable challenges that arise while trying to learn such a difficult language i would definitely recommend her classes
17069,Kimiko  Manes,never stop having fun in the class need to study but you become friends with everyone in your class so studying is easy also she give much work since a language class and it takes time to learn laugh so much be crying how amazing this class is sensei is the best teacher had yet period
17070,Kimiko  Manes,she is so much fun she made a seemingly difficult language very fun and easy to learn all you have to do in this class to succeed is to practice writing and memorizing your characters most of it is really up to you but as far as her teaching style she makes the task interesting and fun
17071,Kimiko  Manes,not a bad teacher but it wa kinda hard to understand what she was tring to say sometimes due to the language barrier also she had an odd ordering of theaching she taught us a lot of stuff we may never use
17072,Kimiko  Manes,sensei manes is very nice and funny she is a good language teacher
17073,Kimiko  Manes,i really like her she really knew her stuff

17075,Steve  Renton,steve is a very good teacher i came to canada from another country and english is not my first language steve really helped me to become a better communicator and i loved his classes
17076,Steve  Renton,steve is a very good teacher he takes an interest in students and helps encourages i enjoyed his class because he treats you with fairness and respect
17077,Steve  Renton,could be more helpful in assignments when taking tests they feel like a guessing game
17078,Steve  Renton,steve was not very helpful the tests feel more like guessing games as they cover material we have not learnt in class worst teacher in the business school
17079,Steve  Renton,
17080,Steve  Renton,nice guy good instructor kinda dry materialbad habit of powerpoint and dictation very approachable but not as helpful as i would have liked

17085,Brad  Hann,does not tell you but takes marks off for wrong answers better to not answer than attempt going in for extra help will not help you sucking up and whining will

17100,David  Briggs,i took tai chi as a gym class because i needed to for my major i figured it would be easy and hardly any out of class work for a credit physical education class so he gives us two page papers to write on basically nothing and tests who the hell does he think he is dont take tai chi unless your looking for added pointless homework
17101,David  Briggs,dave is a great guy he really knows how to engage the class and make you extremely interested in what he is teaching you tough but fair definitely the only professor you should be learning personal defense from he is the man
17102,David  Briggs,i had briggs for pers def each day we would start with a warmup then cont on with learning basic self def skills class was fairly easy there is a short midterm final each had about ques for both midterm final u hav to show him ur moves he asks for a movement taught u then have to do it this is the pt of the test
17103,David  Briggs,mr briggs is down to earth entertaining very knowledgable and made me care about a course that was originally just to satisfy a requirement
17104,David  Briggs,if ever you wanted a real life yoda dave is the man humorous friendly engaging and actively involved in goals and inquiries sometimes he invites the class to stay after if they like to practice more advanced techniques very glad to have taken this class i wish i were still in it

17114,Bob  Broderick,bob is a very smart man and he keeps it intresting love the guys attitude
17115,Bob  Broderick,bob was an amazing teacher read the chapters before hand and understand what he is talking about in class his tests are not bad if u do the reading he is a very wise and brilliant professor and should be repected those who want to talk bad about him should try doing the work before they are going to blame their misfortunes on bob
17116,Bob  Broderick,all he does is put up overheads and babble on for hours about things we know about and not in a way for us to learn then the random stories he just goes off on
17117,Bob  Broderick,i loved this teacher he seems super intimidating and grumpy at first but he was so great study for his exams and ace them funny he interacts with the students kids around about all sorts of stuff all around awesome teacher
17118,Bob  Broderick,poor retired and cranky

17125,Lauren  Kingsley,i was a freshman english snob who thought i was too good to take freshman english but i really enjoyed her class lauren kept things lively and taught us really practical things
17126,Lauren  Kingsley,kingsley is the most brilliant intelligent and effective teacher at u of m she is an extremely tough grader but she is a constructive critic my writing improved tremendously bc of this prof
17127,Lauren  Kingsley,she is one of the best writing profs at u of m if you get the opp to take a class with her grab it
17128,Lauren  Kingsley,a hard prof and a tough grader but the class will improve your writing tremendously the books are interesting and the discussion is engaging a good choice for intro writing
17129,Lauren  Kingsley,what they said
17130,Lauren  Kingsley,while she is an extremely hard grader do not expect an a she is extremely fair in her teaching and if you put in the timeyour grade reflects it she is always willing to help you at any time great book selection
17131,Lauren  Kingsley,she is a very hard grader but if you are willing to meet with her in office hours frequently she can be very helpful take the class planning to get an a
17132,Lauren  Kingsley,really hard grader always all over the place and pretty unclear about assignments one time someone was unsure of an assignment and even she remember what the assignment was
17133,Lauren  Kingsley,she is a hard grader but learn a lot about writing in this class there is a lot of discussion in class and there are frequently group critiques of papers
17134,Lauren  Kingsley,no comments

17136,Jennifer  Spock,if thinking about taking this professor save yourself a headache and she makes sure that impossible you get an a she lectures every single class rambles the entire time she expects you to talk in discussion to get your grade assigns ch plus other readings to do every night insane work for gen ed
17137,Jennifer  Spock,dr spock is an incredibly nice person and seems to genuinely care about her students succeeding that said the class is harder than you would expect its a lot of dense reading and she lectures the full class sometimes a couple minutes after but the tests impassable if a history major take her but if not find someone easier
17138,Jennifer  Spock,dr spock was very good at giving lectures but the course load is insane talking three or four assignments due every week this was a general education course for me but this was the class i spent the majority of my time studying and doing homework for it is a very difficult class and you will not pass without effort i would not recommend
17139,Jennifer  Spock,i loved dr spock her class is probably one of the harder ones that currently taking but she gives lots of extra credit and is always ready to help you will do more writing than you might like but she gives good feedback lots of reading lots of class participation a tough class for a gen ed but i would definitely take her again
17140,Jennifer  Spock,a really nice lady however there is lots of homework and it gets tiring to do what we learn about i feel is kinda irrelevant so it makes it hard to listen in class and absorb the information
17141,Jennifer  Spock,you have to attend class to understand what she makes you read she lives breathes and bleeds russia shes a great person and i like her as a person but as a professor no thank you
17142,Jennifer  Spock,she was difficult for a level course four tests all semester including the final not difficult at all as long as you do the work and take the notes i loved her great personality
17143,Jennifer  Spock,this class is an absolute joke the class material will put you to sleep and have you wondering why you are even in the class the teacher is rude and very annoying it is a level gen ed class and she acts like it is a level class or something way to much pointless work way to hard of grading work and in general just an unlikeable person
17144,Jennifer  Spock,dr spock is one smart lady not many people know as much about history as she does especially when it comes to the mongols and russia if you are a history minor or major you will benefit greatly from her class however if you are taking it for a gen ed then expect a lot of reading taking notes studying and hard work she grades essays hard
17145,Jennifer  Spock,this class is doable but given another option i would have definitely taken it a lot of unnecessary reading and responding the tests quizzes are difficult and the essays are impossible she does offer a lot of help though so that entirely too much work for a gen ed course
17146,Jennifer  Spock,dr spock was very helpful in all the assignments and gave great feedback
17147,Jennifer  Spock,dr.spock is a brilliant teacher she knows what she is speaking about she understands that we all are college students and tries to help us in anyway possible pay attention and take notes or you will not pass
17148,Jennifer  Spock,shes an awesome teacher her work is difficult but she knows what she is talking about if you listen and do the will learn a lot
17149,Jennifer  Spock,dr spock is one of my favorite teachers she is a very hard grader and getting an a from her on a project is hard but if you really work hard you will get an a in the class she is very helpful outside of class on your research project for civ go see her she is great this is just a very hard class
17150,Jennifer  Spock,dr spock is a hard professor but she will help you if you ask for it she is flexible if you have circumstances outside of class and she will try her best to help you in anyway she can i recommend taking her classes if you want to be challenged and learn a great deal
17151,Jennifer  Spock,she is probably the best professor at eku she teaches what you need to know and goes into depth clearly however her class is a little hard you need to study for this class hands down care what you do she openly accept requests for help via email appointments etc a great teacher you regret taking this class
17152,Jennifer  Spock,russian history tough class but she will warn you of that ahead of time however very helpful to students both in class and outside of class russian history was very interesting though there is a lot of writing get an a in her class it will make you feel like you can accomplish anything
17153,Jennifer  Spock,love this woman
17154,Jennifer  Spock,this class requires lots of study and memorization you will have to be able to label maps and talk about things in lengthy detail papers were required in this course and also quizes and test you will have reading respoces that will have about questions to them they are woth points each dr spock is a great teacher
17155,Jennifer  Spock,the class is what it says it is research methods the material she teaches you is invaluable throughout the rest of your time as a history major although she is very tough when it comes to writing she grades fairly and will help you no matter what the problem is i believe the class is now his
17156,Judy  Sumner,oh judy she frustrated me made me laugh forced me to learn how to teach myself not that great of a teacher really but super nice and super cute
17157,Judy  Sumner,awesome teacher very intelligent
17158,Val  Wilson,i loved having val as a teacher
17159,Val  Wilson,unclear expectations of what we should tested on
17160,Val  Wilson,she goes on and on about the same information probably a good nurse but not prof
17161,Val  Wilson,val genuinely cares about her students she can be intimidating with first impressions but if struggling and go see her oneonone she will work with you and help you understand the content she is an amazing clinical preceptor who is very tough and makes you work hard but is always on your side
17162,Val  Wilson,she provide adequate information for any assignments learning material or reviews she spends hours talking about pointless information on material that students have already learned or we have absolutely no idea what talking about terrible prof good nurse but terrible prof
17163,Val  Wilson,feels like she know what talking about her discussions are extensive for absolutely no reason and confuses people
17164,Val  Wilson,bad news for everyone maybe a good nurse but an evil prof
17165,Val  Wilson,no comments
17166,Val  Wilson,umm uhh like you know
17167,Mary  Meisenhelter,not a bad professor but shes very unorganized and does not have an approachable demeanor seems constantly annoyed not a tough grader definitely put effort in the hw assignments gives study guides for test know the essay questions she does not like cellphones shell spend of class time lecturing about cellphones being a disruption
17168,Mary  Meisenhelter,had her for classes in the same semester and i say i hated either she wants you to be in class because if not not going over info again funny and has a lot of experience in her field
17169,Mary  Meisenhelter,wonderful lectures are full of examples in the management field as she has a great management background tests and a optional final but all come with study guides which are very helpful online quizzes per week but they are open note papers but not hard to write she will help you outside of the classroom with finding internships
17170,Mary  Meisenhelter,by far my favorite professor at ycp she is demanding but only because she expects the best from her students she truely cares to see them do well i learned more from her than any other prof at ycp i took classes the she taught wonderful professor
17171,Mary  Meisenhelter,no comments
17172,Mary  Meisenhelter,very demanding instructor not always clear on what she is looking for has high expectations and grade hard
17173,Mary  Meisenhelter,dr meisenhelter made the class interesting as long as you go to class and do your assignments there is no reason you should fail this course dr meisenhelter was helpful she does not put you down for not knowing and will help if you need it do not be afraid to ask
17174,Mary  Meisenhelter,dr meisenhelter is not horrible do not take this class unless you need it not very interesting she is a nice lady and will help you with anything you need tests are hard but the presentation is easy go to class lots of notes each day
17175,Jerome  Cooper,avoid this professor did not grade according to his own stated criteria very late in returning work very limited participation in required online discussions

17190,Lisa  Keys,lisa is a very unique professor which a true interest in history she tells history in story form and really wants her students to learn and enjoy the past and be prepared for the future
17191,Lisa  Keys,very interesting teacher she keeps you into the lecture which makes it easier to keep the knowledge your hearing
17192,Lisa  Keys,boring horrible reading awful book tests are all essay form really who the hell wants to write an inclass essay for a history test teacher was a good speaker though kept you interested the book and tests did not
17193,Lisa  Keys,she is very demanding for an intro class.i am an a student and received a no explanation except she basically did not like my essays and that is the majority of your grade on exams and projects.i went to every class and studied.she has her favorites.not to mention she is very recamended unless you like to suck up to people
17194,Lisa  Keys,she is very helpful makes history fun really i like history but she was awesome
17195,Lisa  Keys,page paper on anything you want was told i was going to get a b if i redid an assignment then the report card said d still no response from this teacher about what the deal was not recommended at all
17196,Lisa  Keys,dr is a very good teacher and really like what she does which shows when she teaches you will especially like her if a history major even if you like history she makes the subject fun to learn pretty fair on grading although the paper is worth quite a bit great about making sure prepared for her tests
17197,Lisa  Keys,i had her twice because i dropped her class at lcc an excellent teacher passionate about her work if you are a baby and like to learn write not that there is a lot of writing involved or work i would suggest avoiding her probably one of the best teachers at siue
17198,Lisa  Keys,she is a tough grader an the fact that the paper has such a significant effect on your grade make sense since the paper is on anything you want to write about on the up side she does make the topic interesting and she really enjoys what she teaches also she is willing to work with you
17199,Lisa  Keys,good teacher
17200,Lisa  Keys,i disliked she gave you a good grade if she agreed with what you said and not such a good grade if she too subjective and english teacher like only taught about france and nothing else i learn anything important i would not recomend unless you area an ass kisser
17201,Lisa  Keys,has her favorites and is a tuff grader if you stand up to her or ask questions that she does not like and ay to stuck on napoleon i mean hello there is more to history
17202,Lisa  Keys,tries to be fair but does have her favorites loved the class learned a lot and is the best history teacher i have ever had.at least she tries to make it fun.hated the tests an essay question should not be paragraphs long.this is not english class
17203,Lisa  Keys,i did not like this teacher because i thought she was a very unfair grader

17208,Lisa  Keys,wonderful teacher the best history teacher ever had if more teachers taught history like she did there would be a lot more kids that would know their history and have fun while they learned it too
17209,Ryan  William,if you are having issues with this class drop out of the school of journalism this is as easy as it gets show up to class pay the least bit of attention and get out with an a the content is incredibly interesting just listen he spoon feed it to you he expects you to learn not gonna hold your hand great prof
17210,Ryan  William,try to avoid this professor the class itself has good content but this professor is somewhat rude and does not seem to know how to treat students and help them succeed
17211,Ryan  William,the speakers are very interesting and the class gives you a great overview of journalism the daily quizzes were easy but they are written by gtfs so toughness could change each term
17212,Ryan  William,such a great class he brought in people from nike who showed unreveled products he is a great person to make friends with and a respected recommendation letter and the quizzes every day are easy
17213,Ryan  William,dr ryan is an amazing creative storyteller and is renowned in the multimedia community for his skills and expertise during my time with him we had many influential people come in as guest lecturers including the creative director for cocacola design moguls and renowned faculty get to know him stay after class and participate it will help
17214,Ryan  William,bill ryan has got to be one of the coolest teachers at the uo if in his level class in for a lot of yelling guest lectures and emails with links to google image searches for cats in smaller classes a ton of work that may or may not be turned in and more links to cats but the man is a genius enjoy
17215,Ryan  William,easily one of my favorite professors at the uo although he does not lead the class every time the guest speakers that he brings in are amazing the grade is based on quizzes taken almost every day of class but if you pay attention you will get on every one this was one of the easiest classes i have taken so far i totally recommend him
17216,Ryan  William,tests were terrible and non relevant to the class material
17217,Ryan  William,ryan is a hard teacher and demands the most out of you but trust me in the end it will be worth it i discovered a passion for graphic design after taking his class and i am grateful i had a professor who only wanted the best from me and settle for meritocracy
17218,Ryan  William,ryan is the man demand the best from you push you prod you but all worth in the end
17219,Ryan  William,the most frustrating class i ever took you could never see him during office hours he never replied to emails and he was a perfectionists on the assignments i would probably spend about hours a day for weeks in the computer lab for assignment tests really test on what you learned how am i supposed to remember what the photographe
17220,Ryan  William,ryan has a very high opinion about himself often name drops the various famous people in the industry he has worked with or interviewed you have to have the bookwhich he wrotefor his class or you will fail since of the on the test are found in the text he has an unhealthy addiction to kayaking which he brings up at least times a day
17221,Ryan  William,first he is the most arrogant professor i have ever had he uses his own book inwhich you have to read to pass the class with better than a c we watched movies about kayaking and if you dont do what he wants on your projects get a bad grade even if your project is good an ass
17222,Ryan  William,i enjoyed class though he puts too much emphasis on fonts and his tests are annoying the assignments are fun he loves kayaking we are still friends until today
17223,Ryan  William,lameo stay away
17224,Ryan  William,at first i was very encouraged and found him to be very interesting and intelligent then i got sick of him showing his award winning work with all the famous people he interviewed in his book i ran into someone who said she was in the j school years ago and dropped out because of the arrogant teachers like ryan
17225,Ryan  William,i found dr.ryan to be very engaging and inspiring professor he is extremely knowledgeable on his subject seeing as he wrote the book on although he has high standards he really takes pride in his students and is there to help you succeed in his class the j school and the journalism field utilize his office hours
17226,Ryan  William,bill ryan and his class are a nice breath of fresh air in the jschool he does have high demands and can come across as arrogant but ryan is probably the teacher you will want to know outside of class you really do learn a lot about design from him he is well respected and can set you up with a job or internship i enjoyed his class
17227,Ryan  William,very into his topics very enthusiastic and makes this class fun pay attention and attend all lectures tho
17228,Ryan  William,i loved most parts of this course became frustrated with other aspects he respects students but puts his time above all else i loved his lectures if you love design then this course will your put up with the difficult realities prove that you know the material in your projects he wrote the book so he tests on all of it read
17229,Michelle  Radcliffe,convince a classmate to take notes for your and then show up for test days you will do fine tedious notegiver this class is common sense learn the vocab and do fine
17230,Michelle  Radcliffe,not bad
17231,Michelle  Radcliffe,no comments
17232,Michelle  Radcliffe,no comments
17233,Elle  Feth,feth is the worst professor ever had she refuses to use blackboard so you have to constantly hound her if you want to know about your grades she does treat you like stupid the textbook for this course is useless she uses old activities that are copied so many times they are not even legible she is incredibly arrogant without reason
17234,Elle  Feth,the worst teacher even took a class with in my enitre life
17235,Elle  Feth,elle feth is awful her lectures are not only boring but incredibly complicated and far too detailed the tests and assignments are easy but in the end end up regretting taking the course the testa are straightforward however she uses confusing language and will not clarify do not take this course with her
17236,Elle  Feth,i took the hybrid version with feth and have no regrets show up for every lab for easy points and keep up on your reading and powerpoints tests were straight from the material
17237,Elle  Feth,feth was the absolute worst professor i have ever come across at cscc she is boring rude and has a dry sense of humor bother asking questions because she refuses to answer anything her tests are insanely hard her notes rarely ever help with understanding the material my advice is drop feth instantly if you see her as your instructor
17238,Elle  Feth,this was a hybrid class for me and feth was the online teacher she responded quickly to email questions and if you read the chapters took practice quizzes and attended your labs the class was fine the lab teacher was a different story and they seem to communicate lab sheets were not graded in time for quizzes lab teacher did not teach
17239,Elle  Feth,where do i start feth is awful grouchy rude boring she disrespected everyone in our class and made us all feel stupid she was completely inappropriate at times bother asking questions or making light conversation good luck if you understand something i use the book at all just notes hardly went she was so mean
17240,Elle  Feth,graduating this quarter from cscc and am transferring to another school and from all the teachers i have had so far professor feth is by far the worst.everybody giving a bad review on this teacher is right she will not answer your questions and will talk to you like you are stupid the point in taking a class is to learn and to be guided not
17241,Elle  Feth,despite what other people have said i think ok her teaching style is not particularly entertaining but you always expect that she does not suffer fools and can be a bit grumpy but she teaches the material in a straightforeward wellorganized manner just make sure you think before you ask questions
17242,Elle  Feth,this is the worst teacher i have ever had in my life and if you have her i would suggest dropping it immediately she is the most miserable women i have ever met she talks down to all her students and if you ask her a question she will either laugh at you or embarrass you in front of the class i hope columbus state will get rid of her soon
17243,Elle  Feth,this has to be the worst teacher i have ever had between her dull put me to sleep lectures to her egotistical i wrote the text book attitude all the way to her absolutly miss one symbol and you fail grading she is the worst i have ever seen she doesnt care if you fail and wont help you if you are if you are in her class drop it asap
17244,Elle  Feth,she will not help you with any questions you have she will only tell you to reread the instructions and do nothing else she treats you like you are still in middle school and always talks down to you she tells you that you have items like laptops even though it is allowed in the cscc school policy
17245,Elle  Feth,the worst teacher i have ever had it is impossible for this woman to see past her own bombastic ego manipulates and mocks students when they have questions her license should be revoked she only holds her possition she wrote the text
17246,Elle  Feth,she is not an easy teacher but really wants her students to study and learn the material i thought she was pretty good
17247,Elle  Feth,professor feth is one of my favorite teachers ever she teaches well and take from immature students
17248,Elle  Feth,easily the worst teacher at the college she is horrible do not take her class and maybe the department will get the hint she does not want anyone to pass her class so they have to retake it and pay more money she
17249,Elle  Feth,she isthe worst teacher i have ever had in college if you get her drop the class she says she is married i feel sorry for her husband that he has to wake up to her in the morning
17250,Elle  Feth,she is known as failing feth she doesnt care about her grades at all and if you ask for help she laughs at you i disliked her
17251,Elle  Feth,a bit uptight but overall a very good teacher
17252,Elle  Feth,took a subject i hated and helped me grow to love it
17253,Steve  Gruenert,organizational class was amazing
17254,Steve  Gruenert,dr gruenert is a deep thinker and really wants to hear all students thoughts and opinions during class although he may appear to be intimidating at first he really just wants class participation i learned so much in this discussionbased class and would encourage anyone to take his classes
17255,Steve  Gruenert,he treats his students with respect and likes to push them to think about their beliefs from all angles
17256,Steve  Gruenert,great funny stuff
17257,Steve  Gruenert,intelligent ahead of the game expects professionalism learning will occur take his classes at any cost
17258,Steve  Gruenert,dr gruenert is intelligent and he expects you to be intelligent as well he treats his students with respect and understanding and teaches for a practical world
17259,Steve  Gruenert,he is very frank fair and consistent dr gruenert clearly gives the expectations and he allows room for student growth his classes are fun and he has a sense of humor his style is different but makes the class

17275,Carlos  Centeno,he was the best english teacher the class is so not boring the essays are mostly point of view and you dont have to read boring stuff the books are about pop culture take him
17276,Carlos  Centeno,very helpful and topics related to current events we watch t.v shows and movies to write the essays very organized and clear get to get out minutes early from the class overall great instructor
17277,Carlos  Centeno,mr centeno is a very good english teacher its not your typical english class where you read some old poem and analyze it in a paper he assigns topics that are interesting and actually affect us
17278,Tracy  Morkin McGill,best chem professor for easily tests are harder than the other professors but such a good lecturer that it offsets it she also provides the opportunity for a point bonus each test that helps a lot you have to work but she makes it worth it
17279,Tracy  Morkin McGill,mcgill is a nice person but her lectures help you at all for the tests brace yourself for a lot of selflearning and selfstudying you will have to do the tests will wreck you but aleks learning catalytics attendance and participation will really boost your grade at the end of the semester so good luck
17280,Tracy  Morkin McGill,mcgill is going to be a hit or miss for all of her students her style was very much pose a question and watch students struggle even if they were going in the wrong direction before explaining the right answer aka very roundabout in her teaching if you take her i highly recommend getting notes from students who have already taken the class
17281,Tracy  Morkin McGill,excellent lecturer gets you engaged and makes sure you leave class having learned something attendance is mandatory but you have to participate unfortunately she has ridiculously difficult exams and a luckbased bonus system which drags down your gpa other professors for the same course will have easier exams
17282,Tracy  Morkin McGill,one of my favorite professors at emory really awesome lectures that i actually enjoyed going to and fair albeit difficult tests
17283,Tracy  Morkin McGill,uses the reverse classroom dependent on peer teaching and very little lecture
17284,Tracy  Morkin McGill,chem is hard to begin with but mcgill teaches it well she have the traditional powerpoint with bulletpoints so really going to have to do her worksheets and pay attention do all resources mentors office hours etc i had friends in heaven who had basically the same test as us but they never really learned the material
17285,Tracy  Morkin McGill,chem is difficult but doable use all resources office hours epass chem mentors great lecturer kind person helpful at answering questions enthusiastic
17286,Tracy  Morkin McGill,do not take this class unless you can teach yourself she does not curve and is unapproachable do not believe the stuff other people say this class ruins your gpa and she has it out for pre med students i went to epass never missed class studied hrs a week if you took ap chem and are smart take this class if not avoid it at all cost
17287,Tracy  Morkin McGill,so not actually a premed kid or even in stem at emory but i do spend a lot of time in the organic chemistry side of things and from what seen a nice person but her tests are insane not worth it ruin your gpa freshman year take literally any other gen chem prof you regret it
17288,Tracy  Morkin McGill,she is a really good lecturer but she goes so fast hard to grasp the concepts if you have no time to process so i wish she recorded her lectures or something her tests are pretty hard so if you want to a good gpa go take another professor other professors are relatively easier
17289,Tracy  Morkin McGill,really nice and gives good lectures but she gives really hard tests that will kill your gpa
17290,Tracy  Morkin McGill,exhibits a genuine love for chemistry and cares so much for her students and canadian so learn a lot about that if you take her class a definite plus
17291,Tracy  Morkin McGill,amazing really helps you understand the concepts of general chemistry with a little bit of organic mixed in she made me a chemistry major go to chem mentors and do the class worksheets and not hard to get an a
17292,Tracy  Morkin McGill,dr mcgill is very sweet and willing to help if needed her office hours are very helpful the content is difficult but reading and chem mentors really helps for fall mcgill and williams will be the only ones with experience teaching the new course chem so take them
17293,Tracy  Morkin McGill,dr mcgill is a great professor i really liked how she taught however the orgo material is extremely challenging so beware the incorporation of orgo really made me work for my grade btw she is very unwilling to curve your final grade make sure to work hard in the beginning to get grades that can help you when the material gets hard
17294,Tracy  Morkin McGill,i had dr mcgill for chemistry and and her courses this year were the pilot courses for the new chemistry and semester course she did an amazing job of creating the new curriculum and taught it amazingly she cares so much about her students and was so helpful during office hours take her if you want a good grade
17295,Tracy  Morkin McGill,she was an amazing professor who really took time to listen to her students the class will require reading and includes a lot of organic chemistry as this semester she taught the pilot curriculum which is becoming the new chemistry it is a lot more focused on fewer topics and will help to prepare students for organic chemistry for sure
17296,Tracy  Morkin McGill,dr mcgill is very nice but her class can be very challenging she offers extra credit for groups if the group average is above an the class consists mostly of group work on worksheets rather than actual lecture it was sometimes unclear what chapters we should be reading generally we ran out of time before we could go over worksheets
17297,Tracy  Morkin McGill,i took mcgill because i heard that she makes you understand concepts instead of just memorizing equations or facts and i wanted to challenge myself true you have to really work to get a deep understanding of chemistry but she is a good teacher so it is not that hard if you took ap chemistry and did well the class will be a breeze
17298,Kathleeen  Devanney,very sweet and funny lady i would recommend her to anyone but you have to pay attention at all times you have to read the study guide to support answers on assignments test are hard if you do not study so study with all your life like everyday
17299,Kathleeen  Devanney,very hard teacher doesnt explain well and tests you get slammed you study so much but never know whats on the test very hard class dont know if ill survive this semester
17300,Kathleeen  Devanney,she is really hard she writes the textbook she uses and expects you to know just as much about the subject as her
17301,Kathleeen  Devanney,no comments
17302,Kathleeen  Devanney,so far she seems cool makes the class fun and upbeat as far as work i dont know yet its only been weeks so see but she really is funny
17303,Kathleeen  Devanney,lots of homework for the labs and you need to study every day to keep up and be ready for test take good notes do all the extra credit tests are very hard you will learn so much excellent teacher
17304,Kathleeen  Devanney,her labs are relatively easy she does help you with them but you better get extra credit because when time comes for a test you get slammed even if you study you can have chapters from the book and chapters from the lab you have to alot of the
17305,Robert  Stecker,dr stecker might be the best philosopher on campus but note that that entail he has the best pedagogy i recommend visiting him during office hours give feedback on papers and often willing to have discussions he seems to want his students to be the best philosophers they can be
17306,Robert  Stecker,dr class is really hard to pay attention to because he talks very quietly and is not very engaging he also grades pretty tough too but its not a bad class
17307,Robert  Stecker,often hard to understand because he is constantly mumbling and even confuses himself on various topics
17308,Robert  Stecker,love this professor always willing to help and very easy to understand definitely enjoy his class and learn a lot very little homework would take another class with him in a heartbeat
17309,Robert  Stecker,professor stecker is probably the cutest and sweetest professor at cmu he always cracks jokes and though you read his handwriting he tries his best he assigns readings but usually hands out kind of confusing notes that go along with the readings the quizzes essays are directly from the notes he gives you overall a great guy
17310,Robert  Stecker,professor stecker is one of the sweetest professors you could ever get he loves the material he cracks jokes and he does a lot to help you out and also get to know you as far as the class goes he will assign a reading read it before class to get the basis of knowledge and the next day he will go over it with you so you understand
17311,Robert  Stecker,professor stecker was very knowledagble about philosophy however if you need to take the class take it he gives you handouts with everything you need to know but classes were very dry and boring he had no clear scheduale and papers had no comments
17312,Robert  Stecker,cute little old guy very nice funny not hard just have to show up and engage in class
17313,Robert  Stecker,the class was mostly discussion and lecture based the topics were fairly interesting and he made handouts of all the information we needed to know quiz and exam questions come straight from his handouts not a very tough grader and not the most interesting professor either but the class was very easy
17314,Robert  Stecker,prof stecker is really chill and he definitely takes time to explain anything relevant to the discussion that you understand
17315,Robert  Stecker,nice guy not an easy class take if you have to class is boring but he is helpful if you ask for help
17316,Robert  Stecker,he is a nice guy not the best class i recommend the class but if you do the readings study and pay attention you will be okay grades hard on the papers
17317,Robert  Stecker,the class is very boring at times when there is no class discussion taking place he will go out of his way to help you out when you need it and it helps that he even has a sense of humor
17318,Robert  Stecker,i could not seem to get an a with this guy on any of my papers i think its because i went against all of his personal beliefs he is kind of creepy and you will not be able to stay awake during his class bother studying for the quizzes because he tries to trick you anyways i never did open the book and i ended up with a b
17319,Robert  Stecker,this class is a little boring but he is really nice and knows what talking about he gives you printouts of the notes so study those for the quizzes do well there a papers and the midterm and final are takehome essays and he lets you email a draft to him which is helpful go to class and participate in lecture and its an easy a
17320,Robert  Stecker,i know where to start with this class you sit in your chair and you bang your head against the wall for minutes very boring and dull stecker is a nice guy and helpful but the material he covers really help you if you participate in lecture you should be alright the quizzes are misleading
17321,Robert  Stecker,it was really boring i did everything i could think of to stay awake in that class and never could the quizzes were horribly misleading because of the way they were phrased and he seemed to prefer the papers i wrote the night before they were due to the ones that i worked on ahead of time but he was always willing to help during office hours
17322,Robert  Stecker,took this course as an honors class that bad but he can be a bit of a hard grader on the papers make sure you do the readings and miss quizzes and be fine a nice guy with a good sense of humor and will help you out
17323,Robert  Stecker,he is really hard to understand at times mumbles but overall great humor and very interested in material made the information quite interesting i would take him if u need phl
17324,Robert  Stecker,he is very boring and enjoys listening to himself talk instead of discussing the philosophy articles he would just ask students what they thought so no one learned anything he is a nice guy but his class is super boring only exams midterm and final both take home and two other exams his quizzes although only questions are misleading
17325,Barbara  Townsend,outstanding instructor she is just a delight brings a wealth of knowledge and a spirit of genuine helpfulness to the class she is one of stars
17326,Barbara  Townsend,dr townsend is strict on her papers but if a doctoral student you should be held to a higher standard in reference to a previous comments she is insightful and does a nice job of adding application to the course
17327,Barbara  Townsend,dr townsend is great an actual educatator you have to read you have to write well you get away with sloppy work she holds students to a professional standard my tuition dollars at work not interested in an easy a
17328,Barbara  Townsend,former english teacher more concerned with mechanics citation style and citation style trivia then paper content analyses or provocative ideas
17329,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,quick question quiz every friday of your grade is participation dont bother buying the textbook i never opened mine for any open ended question he asks in class answer it depends of the time be right midterm and final are questions very similar to the quizes take clear notes
17330,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,no textbook necessary for this class ghorashi lectures the entire class which can be boring but he is very clear and always asks if everyone understands because all test and quizzes are based on notes taken during lecture he revisits previous lessons at the beginning of class a quiz every week midterm and final rarely any homework
17331,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,quizzes every friday based on solely what was gone over in class and then a midterm and final as long as you pay attention in class participate a little and do well on the quizzes and tests good a good professor and makes sure to go over concepts a lot and see everyone understands
17332,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,he is a great teacher for intro to microecon he spend around minutes every lecture going over what was learned previous lecture because of the repetitiveness of his lecture hard not to learn the concepts important thing is paying attention in his class because you only have his notes to refer to since he really use the book
17333,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,very interesting and relevant teacher fair grading clear and concise while explaining the topic makes sure everyone understands before he goes on and encourages questions
17334,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,professor ghorashi is an awesome guy he asks about what news is going on and lets us discuss it for a while and then says well go into economics now really funny and his sense of humor is awesome if you show up and take notes and listen the quizzes are easy no textbook needed he also encourages questions because his accent is heavy
17335,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,ghorashi was perfect for micro i can see why his other courses may be more difficult but he taught micro excellently he is passionate very worldly and knowledgeable i was i had been on time and attended better because he takes self phone use and attendance very seriously he is hilarious and committed to making sure you understand the subject
17336,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,i know what he was teaching or grading on and i think he did either at the end of the year i feel like he just gave everyone a b and moved on the class was fine if you mind not learning anything
17337,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,really knowledgeable about the subject but absolutely awful at teaching it at the end of the class i had no clue what he was trying to teach he even tell us there was a final until like a week before the exam if i need this class for my minor i would have dropped it in a heartbeat
17338,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,ghorashi is a nice enough guy but the class was awful being in the class was agony nothing but student presentations and meandering pointless lectures by the professor he really explain any of the homework or projects finishing his assignments felt like guess work honestly i even know if he knew what he expected us to do
17339,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,so much pointless busy work weekly journals every week extra homework hours of research two minute presentations and basically none of it was necessary i have no idea what this class was supposed to be about
17340,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,worst teacher ever there is no syllabus or a need for a textbook half of the time i feel like he makes up things as he goes along no midterm or final but weekely journal articles and minute presentations on pointless topics very hard to understand him as well avoid him at all costs
17341,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,i really wish some other professor would teach intro to global studies i was forced into taking ghorashi for my minor his lectures were rambling and vague of the class time was spent doing minute presentations that explained very well honestly they just felt like an excuse for him to have us teach the class instead of him
17342,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,such an amazing professor related everything to the real world and really engages his students with his humor and animated way of lecturing he always makes sure everyone understands each lesson will go over everything as many times as needed to help you take good notes and review for quizzes and you will do great
17343,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,ghorashi is challenging which is probably the reason for the negative reviews that said if you make the effort to follow his lectures take notes and study outside of class you will find that he is really skilled in taking very difficult concepts and breaking them down also able to lead students to an answer without giving it outright
17344,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,this class was absolutely miserable there is no clear syllabus and or curriculum two twenty minute presentations or a page paper so tough on grading and shows little respect for his students i dropped my minor because of this do not take this class
17345,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,this professor seems like a nice person but his class is miserable no clear curriculum lectures are confusing and make no sense pain in the butt about attendance and participation literally nothing makes sense in his class he seemed to play favorites gives out and b i am trying to avoid any of his other classes
17346,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,professor ghorashi is an excellent professor if you are a decent student he cares about whether you learn so he requires active participation and studying if you do this and are careful to take very good notes in class this course will be easy taking good notes and paying attn in class is key to doing well on exams
17347,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,we use the textbook he made us get there is a quiz every week with open ended questions not easy i missed class because i had a bad cold and i emailed him asking him what homework i needed to do and he refused to tell me and i got a for it picks on you if you look tired even if paying attention you never get out of class early
17348,R. Gholam  Ghorashi,ghorashi is a very good professor economics is a challenging subject nonetheless if you commit to understanding the concepts rather than memorizing you can do well in his class there are only exams so make them count there is very little chance to get grades elsewhere there is no homework
17349,Bob  Warner,i took his astronomy class about years ago so not sure if he still does it very interesting guy who knows his stuff probably one of the best i had his tests are difficult but if you study hard benefit from the curve he got me interested in start gazing and astronomy the observatory trips were great especially the extra ones in the middle of the winter to look at the meteor shower
17350,Bob  Warner,great guy tests are difficult but he does curve to make it fair knows his stuff and the observatory trips are great
17351,Bob  Warner,very cool guy an adjunct who has a love for astronomy and shares it with the students hilarious lectures can drag on sometimes but he is very well informed and clear takes people out to the observatory to observe the stars great guy great class
17352,Walt  Thielen,dr thielen was extremely intelligent and provided us with all the materials required to pass the class his lectures were also thought provoking and entertaining
17353,Walt  Thielen,i took this class as a hybrid class and really enjoyed it the class consists mostly of reading through the teachers slide shows and writing down information on a paper you could use on tests which took a lot of time but helped me really succeed in the class the teacher was very nice also
17354,Walt  Thielen,professor thielen is an amazing person he gives good feed back and his presentations are very informative you really only need the book to for a few questions on the tests that reference his slides i took this class online and had a blast if you need to take a communications class take this class with this professor you regret it
17355,Walt  Thielen,professor thielen is a good teacher and just a good person in general his lectures are interesting and he cares about his students there was a lot of reading and homework but i was in his hybrid class show up do the homework and study for the tests and do great
17356,Walt  Thielen,dr thielen is awesome he does such a good job at engaging the students in interpersonal comm he gives you every opportunity to make up lost points with multiple extra credit options if you do the work you pass but you will have ample time to do it and its very easy work i would take this class again thats how good it was
17357,Walt  Thielen,dr thielen is a true gem at pvcc took his interpersonal communication class and it was amazing his lectures are interesting and he wants you to participate he is very clear and appreciates his hard work would defedentley take his class again
17358,Walt  Thielen,his class is very fun took his hybrid class so we met once a week all the material was online on canvas he gives a notetaking guide that correlates to each slide in his presentations and you can use that cheat sheet on the exams you can also fill the margins with extra notes and okay loved his class
17359,Walt  Thielen,an amazing teacher at first i thought the class would be very boring but as the semester went on the class became very easy as long as you pay attention the tests are exactly like the review it would be very hard to fail this class
17360,Walt  Thielen,was nervous about this class but i found it to be one of the best classes ever taken thielen is organized and wants to provide a class environment where student can learn and be successful he works extremely well with hard of hearing students or disabilities highly recommend this teacher and would take him again for sure
17361,Walt  Thielen,professor thielen was awesome he allows you to use your study guides on the tests making them easier if you like purchasing textbooks find someone who can share theirs with you you will need it you might get some last minute cancellations and he allows you unexcused absences but he makes class interesting enough i recommend him
17362,Walt  Thielen,dr thielen was probably the best professor ever had at pvcc he is helpful considerate and so clear in his direction i learned a lot from his class he comes highly recommended as long as willing to really do the work read the book and study for the tests
17363,Walt  Thielen,mr thielen was an excellent teacher the subject matter was not to difficult he made coming to class a joy he is very charismatic and you can tell he enjoys what his work
17364,Walt  Thielen,he lectures were entertaining and eye opening there is a fair amount of homework in the class and must read the textbook if you want to do well in class that was my problem i just listened and took notes on powerpoints but read text book like students who recieved a better grade than me
17365,Walt  Thielen,great instructor states clear objective every class very organized and enjoys what he is doing if you show up you will pass easy course
17366,Walt  Thielen,great teacher fun class homework is not hard and gets easier after you do it a few times one of my favorite classes i have ever taken
17367,Walt  Thielen,i cannot say enough about what a wonderful teacher dr t is incredibly nice very helpful he makes what been a very dry subject a fascinating one i always looked forward to his class will jump at the chance to have him as a teacher again the class is not hard there really that much work to do fun class fun teacher
17368,Walt  Thielen,seriously one of the best teachers i have ever had not only does he know communication he practices all of the lessons in his lectures i will be watching for other classes he instructs in the future to register for those be prepared though there is lots of homework but its worth it
17369,Walt  Thielen,really awesome teacher you can tell he really loves what he teaches class is pretty easy just do the journals and you get to use study guides on the tests
17370,Walt  Thielen,dr thielen teelynn is an amazing professor you can tell he really enjoys what he does so glad i had him for a teacher the class is very interesting never a bore and the work level is moderate just do the work he believes in true learning not just memorizing for a test
17371,Walt  Thielen,dr thielen teelynn is easy to understand and very organized i was in his hybrid class and his presentations were easy to follow and understand the book is used heavily as you have to write a discussion paper every two to three weeks the tests taken on scantrons too difficult but fair and occasionally have funny suggested answers
17372,William  Irvine,great professor
17373,William  Irvine,prof was great he was interesting and funny the lectures went quickly he spoke quickly so keeping us was important but the class itself was fairly straightforward wish he retired now
17374,William  Irvine,one of the most arrogant professors i have ever had some of the most confusing lectures i have ever had was with him apathetic towards his students he is now retired
17375,William  Irvine,very interesting lectures never boring but sometimes speaks too fast and hard to keep up with notes
17376,William  Irvine,a fantastic history prof who approaches his lecture with a bit of a sense of humour
17377,William  Irvine,awesome prof speaks quickly in lecture but if you pay attention the lectures are very informative a lot of essays but they are intended to improve your writing for your future university career.i would love to take another class taught by him
17378,William  Irvine,he tends to rush his lectures and it can be pretty hard keeping up his style is rather theatrical but he reads off his paper in front of him which sort of detracts from it i loved him the one time he covered for our ta laid back and with no notes he joked around answered questions and imparted lots of info his lectures should be like that
17379,William  Irvine,the best prof i have had at york his lecture are fastpaced so it is best to have a laptop for taking notes he presents the material in an exciting often humorous way be prepared to work hard there are lots of readings and essays still if you keep you with everything an is possible
17380,William  Irvine,very interesting can you hear me in the back ok and thank you again for turning off your cell phones today we will be talking about he goes pretty quickly but is easy to follow course is tough for first year and to bad he teaching it anymore
17381,William  Irvine,irvine was easily my favourite professor this year the workload is not easy but manageable if you put in the time so funny and seems very approachable seem to be arrogant like other professors seen exam was very fair and much easier than expected not a hard class if willing to put in the work which most
17382,William  Irvine,funny has a thorough knowledge and lectures with an inbiast opinion especially on hot topics i believe a pretty ideal professor
17383,William  Irvine,a great class and a unique lecturer class really changes the way you approach studies in a tough class but worth the learning experience recommended if you are serious about history
17384,William  Irvine,haha hotness level zero prof irvine was definatly one of my influences to continue my major in history i agree with alot of what was already written he keeps the attention focused during lecture keeps a fast pace speaks with alot of tone and inflection and tries to make jokes here and there i loved the way he pronounced
17385,William  Irvine,prof irvine is the best ever i thoroughly enjoy every lecture even the most boring topic is fun in his class his dynamism also has considerable effect on you in lecture truly loves the material and is eager to talk with you before and after lecture or even just around campus in closing turn off your cell phones
17386,William  Irvine,one of the few professors who can keep the attention of the class throughout partly due to the need to write down so much of what he says interacts well with the class through humour and catering certain lectures to student interest if time permits extremely knowledgeable and lectures are wellorganized talks fast and expects you to keep up
17387,William  Irvine,such a dynamic teacher you can really tell interested in what teaching very knowledgeable and uses good examples to clarify talks at a relatively normal speed not slowed down like many other professors very upfront about how this class will be challenging keeps class interesting with his enthusiasm keeps the class engaged
17388,William  Irvine,tough class irvine knows his stuff
17389,William  Irvine,i adore irvine great lectures he can even manage to make economics the history snore topic fun well at least not terribly and dry and snore worthy i took his thrid year class too all i have left to say is rrusian rrevolution
17390,William  Irvine,i think hes one one the best profss at york his lectures are really clear and althouh sometimes some of the history topics might be really boringg he makes them interesting and theres only one exam and its straightforward no stupidness on it and its pretty simplee
17391,William  Irvine,i enjoyed his first year class hist1010 so much that i just had to take his third year one and it was honestly well worth it he is one of the best around and funny as hell
17392,Kathleen  McFadden,okay material is really boring and she help making it any better she loves to talk hour and fifteen minute class and she talks the whole time tell you a million times her husband is a pilot and loves to boast herself and talk about all her research but the class is pretty easy if you just study the power points
17393,Kathleen  McFadden,loves to hear herself talk will get extremely offended if you use your phone in class and will threaten to take your phone the amount of work you have to do on some assignments for the amount of points the assignment is worth is completely skewed would not recommend
17394,Kathleen  McFadden,best professor i have probably had at niu really cares about the success of her students and will go beyond to try to explain something you have to work for an a but you actually learn a lot in this class
17395,Kathleen  McFadden,best professor by far she is one of the few that truly cares about the wellbeing of her students as a result she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation she is also extremely approachable i am a better person because of her
17396,Kathleen  McFadden,best professor by far she is one of the few that truly cares about the wellbeing of her students as a result she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation many students mirror these sentiments but some do not truly realize how much she has helped them until later down the ro
17397,Kathleen  McFadden,dr mcfadden is an excellent professor she goes out of her way to ensure students learn the material the cases in this class helps with real world application there is a team research paper that further enhances your learning there are tests and one noncumulative final an a is attainable but you must work for it overall professor
17398,Kathleen  McFadden,helped me grow as a student and was really one of the best teacher came across at niu
17399,Kathleen  McFadden,great teacher class will require some work but not too bad
17400,Kathleen  McFadden,dr mcfadden is one of the high knowledge teachers came across in my college career she has a passion for teaching the students and genuinely wants you to learn and succeed she enjoys the topic and you can tell it is her passion most of the real world experience she draws from is in healthcare and aviation one of my favorite niu professors
17401,Kathleen  McFadden,relates to what you need to know in the real world
17402,Kathleen  McFadden,awesome
17403,Kathleen  McFadden,enjoyed the guest speakers and class activities applies to real world a bit of work but fair
17404,Kathleen  McFadden,class is easy until the final a lot of math problems that are hard never take both of her classes at once it is unbearable she has no understanding that students have other classes in addition to hers she is arrogant and mean not approachable
17405,Kathleen  McFadden,if this is the only class you have she is great but most likely that is not the case i had more homework in this class than all of my other classes combined she thinks she is the best person in the world always brags about her being on cnn she also talks about airlines like there the best thing in the world and bashes the healthcare feild
17406,Kathleen  McFadden,the class itself too bad cases exams last exam is extremely card due to calculations and one final project the class would have been enjoyable if it for the stupid ga the ga loves marking answers wrong never gave anyone in the class a perfect score for a
17407,Kathleen  McFadden,exact same structure as cases paper and presentation class is not hard listen in class and take notes in packet pop an addy and memorize her study guide and at least get a b pretty easy grader on paper cases waste of time buy book just snap a pic of the cases
17408,Kathleen  McFadden,she is not a bad teacher but she does things that really annoy the students.she is that teacher who wants to keep you until the last second of class and loves to hear herself talk she takes about a month to grade anything.she wants to give out all these assignments and try to grade tough but even grade them within a decent amount of time
17409,Kathleen  McFadden,she seems very nervous when reading her notes word for word theres long awkward pauses she just really needs to learn how to how to read to us she giggles randomly which gets very annoying she only wants you to memorize info someone please help her the world doesnt revolve around just healthcare airplanes need to learn
17410,Kathleen  McFadden,workload was above average class time was a lot of lecture too much time spent on weekly group presentations dr mcfadden really wants students to get it and she is very very passionate about quality lot of memorization not an easy grader but if you put in the effort you will get the textbook needed for hw could share
17411,Kathleen  McFadden,she has ok teaching style but her grading is absolutely horrible i have a and she still give me a c mostly it is the ta who grades the materials and she even care about your grade avoid if possible
17412,Lee  Grenci,lee grenci taught me well his classes were interesting valuable for those who want to use the knowledge in their daily life this information helped me during my career with traveling picking places to live dealing with climate and understanding changes in climate and how the weather patterns affect us all i am grateful to this man
17413,Lee  Grenci,this guy is impossible to understand online he gives more info than what is needed he could get to the point but take this class unless you want to work a week on it every class i have taken is easier than this one far easier
17414,Lee  Grenci,good guy but missing a few good teacher qualities great ways of explaining things but thinking of a concept slightly differently will be ridiculed he expects high levels of thinking even for basic ideas his grading is overly particular and will nickel and dime you to a lower grade past his corny jokes ego and aformentioned points ok
17415,Lee  Grenci,can not belive this course is a level course lee is great but the course is definately not level material i have sailed through some level courses that compare to the level of difficulty in this course avoid it if you can
17416,Lee  Grenci,not too bad corny but funny
17417,Lee  Grenci,class becomes impossible second half to much for a gen ed should be called meteo dont take meteo
17418,Lee  Grenci,the material is hell to understand the best advice if you want a good grade is do your best in the first half of the semester the material the half is horrible also the project grades are a big part of your grade take your time and get all the points you can from these
17419,Lee  Grenci,this is the hardest class i have ever had if you are planning on taking this as an online course be ready to work hours a week really tough course not suggested
17420,Lee  Grenci,grenci was really enthusiastic about the course however i found the online course to be quite challenging for a gened requirement if you are willing to put in a few hours a week and give an honest attempt you can be successful in this class
17421,Lee  Grenci,meteo is hell lee grenci is the devil take this class
17422,Lee  Grenci,this class was wicked hard and since it was a stupid online world campus class we allowed to meet with him to ask questions this class blows
17423,Lee  Grenci,great teacher keep up the good work lee
17424,Lee  Grenci,tuff class alot of work can reuse later in life if you put the work in the grade will show it
17425,Lee  Grenci,demands high quality work knows his stuff is passionate about teaching and wants his students to succeed has poor philosophical ideas and humor
17426,Lee  Grenci,sure his jokes were tasteless at times but i learned a lot
17427,Lee  Grenci,i took meteo class and he was the best professor had his class is fun he makes it very easy to learn and his tests are cake if you go to his study session every week as long as you show up and take notes an a is in the bag
17428,Lee  Grenci,i have never encountered someone so high on himself take this class if you plan on having time to eat and go potty just gonna give you what grade he feels like anyway i regret the day i selected this class
17429,Gail  Terry,no comments

17431,Gail  Terry,no comments
17432,Gail  Terry,class was appropriately challenging made me feel so accomplished upon earning an a her standards are high but the educational challenge is worth the effort when you approach her with sincere interest she is extremely warm resourceful and helpful
17433,Gail  Terry,the sources of material for her tests made studying kidna hard some was from lecture some was from the book about half hard half easy to figure out what info she would test you on

17435,Gail  Terry,no comments

17440,Mara  Aruguete,i totally felt like she hated me for some reason everytime i walked into the classroom i got a cold shiver and it the air conditioning her class was right after i got done student teaching everyday and she sympathetic at all when i came in right as class started even though i was never late whatever on the positive she did have awesome clothes

17449,Colleen  Whitley,class was easy and always interesting you can revise your papers as many times as you need to get an a really cares about the students and what is going on in their lives no tests no final most of the assignments can be used for honors graduation requirements awesome teacher
17450,Colleen  Whitley,colleen is an amazing professor if you have the opportunity to take her writing class do it
17451,Colleen  Whitley,her rubric is baloney do not make decisions based on her rubric make sure you do a good job on everything she might classify as a major paper and give the minimum on all the other timewasting activities she assigns journal writing and su
17452,Colleen  Whitley,very nice and helpful excited about writing concerned with you learning not about grades if you need a very structured organized class not for you
17453,Colleen  Whitley,one of the best classes i have ever taken
17454,Colleen  Whitley,she is incredibley helpful and does not give busy work she works around the students srengths and helps out with the weeknesses shes been one of my favorites
17455,Colleen  Whitley,prof whitley is awesome i want to be exactly like her when i am sixty or however old she is i love her class and would recommend it to anyone especially if you like to write
17456,Ann  Joyce,had to buy a book that was never used once this lady is very nice though

17465,Margarita  Elorriaga,like everyone else in the department plays favorites and punishes those she like
17466,Margarita  Elorriaga,very easy and fun class easy to get an a in the class and she keeps things interesting like having salsa dancing lessons one of my nicest teachers
17467,Margarita  Elorriaga,a very sweet lady but the class was rediculously easy and a waste of time it was difficult to understand what she wanted at times wonderful lady below average professor
17468,Margarita  Elorriaga,margarita is great very helpful and friendly and makes class enjoyable
17469,Margarita  Elorriaga,i am obsessed with margarita shes is the best teacher in the spanish department i love her helpful always willing to meet with you

17472,Margarita  Elorriaga,no comments
17473,James  Terry,a very kind sweet man people are critical of him for no reason at all clearly bright and enthusiastic even when others are not
17474,James  Terry,one of the more enlightened experiences had in the classroom my writing improved to the point where i did extremely well on my gmat and i attribute that to dr terry and my social sciences instructors i want to emphasize that writing matters in all subjects and terry explains clearly regarding his standards and how to meet them
17475,James  Terry,pretty great i know why people have been critical of him he tries really hard with my class even though of them are either asleep or terrible and silent so
17476,James  Terry,he honestly care about the opinions tell you that on day one if you disagree with him wrong he has this habit of looking around with closed eyes and then when he asks a question to stare at you incessantly he grades like an english teacher not been reprimanded by the school before the subject tho
17477,James  Terry,took women in art impressionism and islamic art my writing improved greatly and writing was emphasized as it is important to convey to your reader what something looks like especially if the or image is not available to the reader i found that he is careful to explain how to write for his class with every single class
17478,James  Terry,this class was one of the worst experiences i have ever had terry likes to offend his students and throw tempertantrums maybe for art students his class might be more enjoyable he certainly is passionate about what he is teaching however he likes to act like an english professor be expected to take just as many english quizzes as art quizzes
17479,James  Terry,this class does move rather quickley it goes from the chauvet caves to guggenheim in bilbao online quizzes fairly easy if you keep up on the readings the midterm and finals are tough lots of slide memorization many slides in arh overlap with pleasures
17480,James  Terry,excellent professor knows his stuff excellent sense of humor does expect students to have an open mind show some interest in the subject and spell check their papers
17481,James  Terry,for one he is not an english teacher but grades like it but worse plus he doesnt even care what you say just that it is his view of grammically correct so boring and he gets in your face and is very rude to many ppl
17482,James  Terry,a man who loves what doing and his teaching shows that the fact that so into it helped me to stay interested a good man
17483,James  Terry,terrible class worries more about his book then teaching the class
17484,James  Terry,no comments
17485,James  Terry,no comments
17486,James  Terry,dr terry is a great teacher yes he grades a little on the hard side but i always learn tons in his classes
17487,James  Terry,dr terry if you pay attention and show up though he count attendance learn a lot where he lacks however is the tests often dr tests are insanely hard and he grades very strictly causal could audit
17488,James  Terry,terry is a great teacher his classes are fun and very easy really helpful and not boring at all art history with terry is a great class to take learn alot of interesting things and fun
17489,James  Terry,no oppinion nothing speicial
17490,James  Terry,fun guy knows a lot about art history and classes to difficult if you do the readings
17491,Kent  Yager,prof yager is overall a good teacher he can be slightly intimidating esp when in a small class but he tries hard to make connections with his students there is homework every night but it is never too lengthy or difficult just be sure to fully read the lecturas skim because the info will show up again on pop quizzes and exams
17492,Kent  Yager,after taking spanish301 with professor yager i took spanish331 with him a year later based almost entirely on the fact that he was teaching it his class is relatively entertaining and he is great at connecting with his students genuinely cares about the wellbeing of his students and understands the perspectives
17493,Kent  Yager,passionate guy loves teaching spanish has been at the burg for three decades as long as you put in the work he will be there to help you do well
17494,Kent  Yager,yager is the absolute best professor had on campus super helpful and you will learn a lot overall his class is easy but his exams are brutal study hard
17495,Kent  Yager,amazing a blast of a class take everything with him
17496,Kent  Yager,i love professor yager so funny and i learned so much spanish in one semester you just have to try hard because he only ever speaks spanish even at the level
17497,Kent  Yager,one of the best professors in the department he really cares about his students and is a fair grader he did require two hours of volunteering outside of class each week but it was enjoyable he knows what talking about and always wants to help you understand
17498,Kent  Yager,an absolutely amazing professor and very fair take him if you can i learned a lot
17499,Kent  Yager,prof yager is amazing i learned a lot of portuguese in one semester take him if you can
17500,Kent  Yager,the tests are pretty much impossible but he wants to see everyone do well in his class so he gives you lots of easy grade opprotunities so waste them
17501,Kent  Yager,gives you a lot of chances to get a good grade by allowing you to rewrite papers or do community service for points however tests are rather difficult and are about a bazillion readings so make sure you know the facts from them
17502,Kent  Yager,this guy is amazing lots of work but he really pushes you to do well and learn alot take him if you can
17503,Kent  Yager,no comments
17504,Kent  Yager,this guy is very hot he is a great teacher and always makes class fun i would also recomend you take this mans class
17505,Kent  Yager,very nice guy and easy teacher the work is not hard and he grades leniently
17506,Kent  Yager,great guy
17507,Kent  Yager,great man and the work is easy busy work but nothing that you have to put your mind to too much and he is a fair grader definitely take him
17508,Kent  Yager,lots of work but well worth it good guy
17509,Kent  Yager,no comments
17510,John  Eppler,professor epler is a really helpful person he makes sure you know what you are doing which is great not the best with math but he helps make it bearable
17511,John  Eppler,i had him for precalc a totally awsome teacher and everyone should take his class
17512,John  Eppler,this guy was awesome he would talk to himself at the board and always insult himself for doing something wrong his class was great and for the first time i understood what the precalc was about
17513,John  Eppler,excellent teacher and it shows he still currently teaches high school problem solving was the easiest math course ive ever taken and im a math major i would honestly be surprised if there was a person in the class who got less than an a easy course even for the math challenged
17514,John  Eppler,easiest math class ever had in life
17515,John  Eppler,no comments
17516,Bob  Young,math you have to work on it daily if you want to understand the concepts this professor also created and posted videos of him teaching each lesson watch them and take notes and you will do fine he is actually quite hilarious in the videos and makes learning less intimidating there is extra credit and he helps anyone just ask
17517,Bob  Young,the best math teacher ever very understanding he loves teaching and it matters because when a teacher loves to teach students will actually understand better
17518,Bob  Young,i had him once a week for trig at night it was not a good time but he made the class lively you really have to work for a good grade but he gives easy and useful extra credit it much but it could bring your test up a letter grade loves interacting with his students will talk to you at least once
17519,Bob  Young,very great teacher hes goofy and out there which is different from the average teacher he makes up funny sayings and tries his best to relate math with real world examples i was never bored in his class he picks on everyone so beware and pay attention at all times i would definitely recommend him i wish i could take him for stats
17520,Bob  Young,young is amazing i suck at math but i got an a in this class after getting a c in intermediate algebra which was taken online with an instructor that always respond to requests for help in time for the test for me the a took quite a bit of intense work generous extra credit and fabulous diy lecture videos were very much appreciated
17521,Bob  Young,always been bad at math and after failing college algebra the first time i never thought be able to pass this class bob young cares about students and offers extra credit amazing study tools online and in person and other helpful tips throughout without his hilarious and effective teaching methods i of passed this class
17522,Bob  Young,i am terrible at math yet i finished this course with an a this was an online course all assignments were open from day of the semester so that students could work ahead extra credit opportunities for every tests professor young wants his students to succeed if you struggle in math he will get you through
17523,Bob  Young,prof young is awesome he really cares about math and his students he offers extra credit on canvas so be sure to do that for some gimme points be sure to do the homework each week and his tests really that difficult as long as you practice young makes math fun and is very funny you will definitely enjoy his class
17524,Bob  Young,i did not know what to expect going into this course however mr young did an outstanding job utilizing canvas and mymathlab to give his students a clear expectation even before stepping into his class there are plenty of resources available i am not the most confident student in math but he brings of the best in his students take his class
17525,Bob  Young,professor young is amazing i have always had a hard time with algebra i made a c in pre algebra even i dropped college algebra three times before finding professor young he speaks math to where i can actually understand it find a better math teacher
17526,Bob  Young,i took mr young for college trigonometry you can tell right away that he really loves math and he really loves teaching trigonometry easy for a lot of students but he really tries his best to explain everything as best he can now moved on to calculus and the fundamentals he taught are helping out a ton
17527,Bob  Young,horrible at math i had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those professor young is the best math teacher i have ever had yes i made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not a concept take him if you struggle with any type of math
17528,Bob  Young,mr young is an exceptional teacher he takes an interest in all of his students and goes out of his way to help you he really makes math a fun experience his class is the most social and friendly math class i ever took mr young gives extra credit opportunities math handouts and videos i would recommend him to any student wanting to succeed
17529,Bob  Young,as a student that usually struggles with math professor young was great i took him online he makes instructional videos for every lesson that are a huge help you can tell that he genuinely loves math and he explains it in a way easy for anyone to understand
17530,Bob  Young,mr young is a great teacher unfortunately i struggled with his class but it is possible to pass his class sure i probably try hard enough but if i can pass so can you there is a total of tests practice tests with each test and homework throughout the week he also gives you extra credit for every test
17531,Bob  Young,mr young is an excellent teacher to have for trig he teaches with enthusiasm and offers a lot to help students especially during his office hours be sure to do your tests on to learn the hard way success depends on your efforts so be afraid to ask in for help i would highly recommend mr young
17532,Bob  Young,mr young provides a relaxed classroom environment he is a funny and bright teacher he gives an extra credit opportunity before each test most of which were just writing paragraphs about math site recommendations he puts all his effort into helping his class succeed could not recommend him more
17533,Bob  Young,he teaches like a kid that is excited for a present on christmas but it makes a usually dull subject engaging i had him in the morning and he was almost better than coffee for waking me up
17534,Bob  Young,great teacher if you struggle with math he is the guy to take he explains things well it really helps unfortunately he wont be teaching stat or else i would taking him again college algebra is tough though so brace yourselves
17535,Bob  Young,best math instructor at the college
17536,Britt  Leatham,prof leatham teaches in a way in which you learn or you from the very beginning he makes it known you control your own grade lots to read but most readings are interesting his style is relaxed honest invigorating and most definitely a giver pays close attention to detail and is forgiving of fault hands down def one of the best
17537,Britt  Leatham,professor leatham is a very unique professor i enjoyed his class very much a lot of reading lectures were always interesting and very good he baby anyone and gets you ready for the real world he tries to get you to really use your mind he breaks the paradigm of professor in a great way too many complainers in his class
17538,Britt  Leatham,really enjoyed this class his lectures are messy but be an adult and organize the information to how it makes sense to you go to office hours for any extra help he is really a sweet man and very excited to teach
17539,Britt  Leatham,recommend him enough go for it
17540,Britt  Leatham,a student and year assistant i know wbl positive dr leatham offers passable classes minimal effort decent grade knowledgeable online reading and exercises mandatory negative egomaniac avoids questions lectures offtopic often late humor problematic when the focus is personal be careful what you say it will be remembered
17541,Britt  Leatham,professor leatham is not your typical professor he talks a lot during his lectures but he makes it fun and interesting he had two exams and they were based on his lectures and on the readings his exams were of our grade he gave a lot of extra credit
17542,Britt  Leatham,his test have nothing to do with what he leactures about if you can call it lecturing our final was about question long he tries to stand and deliver the class but fails miserably there is no organization this class is not hard but it adds so much stress to your life basically in limbo the whole time with your grade stay away
17543,Britt  Leatham,all he does is yell at us i am a bio chem student in calc obviously am good at studying and following the rules but he makes the class so much harder just finished his class and i am still confused at what he actually taught he is jumbled on his exams number on a scantron not sure which one to answer and he updates nothing
17544,Britt  Leatham,his assignments are the definition of busy work not a hard class but time consuming rude for a college professor you do not know your grade until the end and when you ask he will give you some long story about how grades do not matter use his own website which he never updates i do not recommend taking him
17545,Britt  Leatham,definitely the worst professor i have ever had in my entire life you guys are stupid is just one of the many disrespectful things he would say to us please hire a new professor thank you professor leatham for showing me how not to be a teacher
17546,Britt  Leatham,i took him for geology never again i learn anything about geology in the class waited outside of his office for a grade check and he never showed up he also goes off subject a lot in the class and when he does talk about geology very confusing there are class evaluations due every class
17547,Britt  Leatham,leatham spends about of the time rantings mostly trashing students and the way we want to learn or are accustomed to do things he tries so hard to teach in a revolutionary way in terms of getting students to think for themselves really though there is no class assignments are crap he was a week late in submitting final grades
17548,Britt  Leatham,show up to lab do all the chapters he tells you make sure you turn in your evaluations each class and do as much extra credit as you want he literally has no limit you can do hundreds of points of extra credit easily my favorite teacher take what he says personally he cares about his students and has trouble expressing it sometimes
17549,Britt  Leatham,type of person who takes advantage of the fact that they have a captive audience due to students having to be there literally talks about anything he wants but geology always off topic hair brained and unprepared he tries to hard to be a professor that teaches out of the box would highly recommend staying away from his class terrible
17550,Britt  Leatham,a really confusing class at first but once you get used to it really fun i learned a lot most of it self directed i learned how to be more inquisitive and self reliant i enjoyed his class there are no tests but homework is due every class
17551,Britt  Leatham,dr leatham is the worst professor at csusb he is very unorganized he was weeks late in posting our grades he is very unclear he does not speak nicely or respectfully to his students his instructions and directions are very confusing worst teacher do not take him avoid him at all costs
17552,Britt  Leatham,discussion of previous class due each class group project was easy are extremely long and in depth gives a lot of extra credit but you see your grade the whole time so who knows if actually applied extinction project is pretty easy rambles strange but cool winter break is almost over and grades still posted
17553,Britt  Leatham,very strange man i felt the class was a colossal waste of time he will go on a rant for an hour straight everyday of class just very tiring on the ears after a few weeks wants you to learn on your own but the material is nonexistent basically you spend this work time on google and wikipedia
17554,Britt  Leatham,he is very knowledgable about his field of study however he is very unclear about what he expects he also talks about very inappropriate topics in class he is an easy a but not worth taking he is very defensive and he gets upset because nobody participates even though he makes fun of us when we ask questions not a good learning environment
17555,Britt  Leatham,first things first i am not a lazy student and i do all my work however this professor is something else he belittles you if you ask a question very rude and curses all the time he even teach all he does is show videos and talk about irrelevant things in class would never take again or would not recommend
17556,Patrick  Baude,most brilliant mind i have ever met went from meeting you at or any other place and took you to
17557,Patrick  Baude,i love this man teach you how to think like a constitutional lawyer and construct a constitutional argument a bit esoteric for some but if you get what trying to teach you and go in expecting a regurgitation of the text book get as much out of this class as you put in very different from your typical class
17558,Patrick  Baude,took him for con law highly recommend the course his exams are tricky so be careful recommend reading treatise along with class readings if you are interested in judicial history he has some great stories oh and check out his wine blog
17559,Patrick  Baude,baude is a living legend a beautiful mind whose brilliance erupts in nonlinear impressionist waves mixing history the law in a masterful melange no he give you an outline nor directly spoonfeed the info as evidenced by some of the inane comments posted but baude is a true renaissance man a gregarious genius who forces you to grow
17560,Patrick  Baude,if you think that baude is the smartest person ever met either met socrates or you recognize genius when you see it in the words of terry bethel baude knows everything
17561,Patrick  Baude,not bad
17562,Patrick  Baude,not the best
17563,Patrick  Baude,smart guy and nice but he just teach i believe that he lets politics interfere with honest grading and teaching
17564,Patrick  Baude,no comments
17565,Patrick  Baude,i was assigned to take courses with this fellow he is very arrogant teaching method is unenergetic i have no doubt that he is very bright verging on genius but who can benefit with that attitude of his
17566,Patrick  Baude,very bright guy fun to talk to very liberal but fair
17567,John  Hopkins,take two posts to describe this guy got nothing but rocks on the brain for sure designs some ridiculous course with no structure and throws out some ridiculous haphazard notes package for you to try and follow through not at all helpful in class or in lab labs by the way are weekday nights from what a joke
17568,John  Hopkins,no comments
17569,John  Hopkins,john hopkins changed my life an amazing teacher and an amazing person yep a touch teacher but one of the most passionate and helpful profs i have ever had thanks for inspiring me
17570,John  Hopkins,this is ridiculous he has no clue how to teach this class because all he does is lecture and expected to catch on every minute detail
17571,John  Hopkins,his test are hard so get previous years test ie go to the chem engg student society the test questions are exactly the same kinda like econ201 bad at explaining things main things in lectures are his research projects take phys369
17572,John  Hopkins,mean old man care about students cares only about himself no course outline not very organized either
17573,Nelson  Ng,he is a nice man and will try to help you although he gets frustrated easily the material on his tests hard he just grades them wayy to picky he will mark off points for spelling errors go over your test many times before handing them in and everything on lab is on the test but labs are easy
17574,Nelson  Ng,teaches from a physics perspective not a exercise science or at perspective very picky on tests spelling angles of vectors those have to be perfect lecture and lab are fair game for tests as is information and diagrams from the textbook no suprises on the test just information difficult to comprehend
17575,Nelson  Ng,terrible teacher does not teach at all needs to retire
17576,Nelson  Ng,not quite sure why he has a bad reputationsimply go to his class dont when he asks questions if you take the time to talk to him after class or ask him questions actually very helpful and a genuinely nice guy his tests might be challenging but very straightforward about what you need to knowno surprises
17577,Nelson  Ng,take him in the summer if you can much easier then also two decimal places mean two ever round off spelling always counts even supraspinatus
17578,Nelson  Ng,most difficult professor in the major not only because his courses are challenging but because so damn critical if another professor available for the same class take them
17579,William  Ryan,dr ryan was one of the best professors that had i do not rate how good a professor is by how easy they are that said he forced me to learn a lot of material that will help me with my career you must study a lot for his class but it definetly pays off he is also very accessable and helpful if you have questions
17580,William  Ryan,dr ryan is an amazing prof always helpfull and downtoearth fair in grading and easy assignments
17581,William  Ryan,i dont know what that idiot was smoking or on at the time wrote that but ryan although a very nice man is ridiculous as far as exams i dont know what this guy is thinking but he needs to understand that not every college student has countless hours a night to put in to studying towards his class we have other classes as well
17582,William  Ryan,dr ryan is awesome always willing to help you out he understands the needs i loved him as a teacher
17583,William  Ryan,dr ryan is a definete overachiever out of all the fyrst classes ours did the most work the assignments were a little dumb and very time consuming
17584,William  Ryan,dr ryan is a great professor he is a really easy guy to get along with and talk to the material in this class was boring but he tried to make the best of it i will def take him for future classes
17585,William  Ryan,no comments
17586,William  Ryan,most likely the least helpful prof i have ever had gave tests which he openly admitted included subjects we had not covered in lecture
17587,William  Ryan,a good professor whose very personable recommend him to another student interested in a course that he instructs
17588,Jonathan  Anning,bad professor killed my gpa nice guy but does trick questions on exams avoid if you can
17589,Jonathan  Anning,awful does not know how to lecture nor teach anyone anything i studied and also had a tutor be lucky to get a high b he teaches all application so you have basically no idea when taking the test i know ers students cannot avoid him but be prepared
17590,Jonathan  Anning,i felt really awkward asking him any questions because hard to understand you get really easy points for quizzes and labs but the exams are only questions so you really need to know the material tough to get an a but he helps as much as he can
17591,Jonathan  Anning,he is monotone when no one answers his questions but loves participation and enjoys joking if you pay attention in lab and lecture you will do great the course packet was all i used bought the book for nothing he is very helpful in lab and gives you different ways to learn the material allinall a great professor
17592,Jonathan  Anning,really easy course had him for both lecture and lab never any homework he basically tells you exactly on the exams final cumulaive really monotoned though so have fun staying awake
17593,Jonathan  Anning,dr anning is a great teacher his voice is monotone so easy to tune out but he always takes the time to explain everything if you need any extra help there are open labs at least twice a week where you can go and practice on the modles willing to help you outside of class if you need it he also gives tricks to remember the material
17594,Jonathan  Anning,dr anning is a great prof he is monotone and loves to talk your head off but is also overly willing to help he pays attention to the little details so take the time to cross your and dot your there is no text book so you will have to keep track of your handouts they are used for an open note final
17595,Jonathan  Anning,great teacher the course pack is helpful and he gives his students multiple opportunities to learn the material he makes practice worksheets for help and practice quizes you know exactly what to expect he try to trick you and genuinely wants you to learn he is very fair and helpful
17596,Jonathan  Anning,very funny teacher he also makes a good advisor very helpfull go to open labs when you can read you book make sure you know your spelling and listen does talk differently you should be fine if you have him
17597,Jonathan  Anning,great teacher really wants his students to get anatomy just go to class and pay attention and do a little bit of studying before tests and you should be fine
17598,Jonathan  Anning,this guy makes it hard to wake up at his monotone voice and relatively boring approach to teaching cause me to fall back to sleep almost every class if you can take applied anatomy with another teacher
17599,Jonathan  Anning,if you can get past the class and sit through his sometimes boring lectures do fine just keep up with notes his slides are very helpful and the amazing he seems like a really great guy he just gets a little nervous no homework but keep up on your studies
17600,Jonathan  Anning,he is a pretty good anatomy professor if never heard him speak before be prepared this man needs speech therapy keep up with the studying for lecture it will pile up lecture tests are easier than the other prof but you never know what will be on it unfairly i think
17601,Jonathan  Anning,he is so not hot i dont know what thinking haha and so monotone i sleep almost every day hahaha
17602,Jonathan  Anning,amazing prof
17603,Jonathan  Anning,i had dr.anning his first year teaching at sru a really nice guy willing to help when i had him he seemed slightly nervous teaching in front of the class but if you talked to him one on one afterward a great helper and great teacher
17604,Jonathan  Anning,really nice and has a dry sense of humor he uses repetition and cares if you understad the material and i think cute
17605,Jonathan  Anning,he is really helpful in labs kinda hard to understand in voice can be kinda overbearing study your notes and color in your coloring book and you will do fine very easy and useful information
17606,Jonathan  Anning,so easy study your notes n show up to class n be just fine will give help if you ask labs require some extra studying but he basically tells you what will be on it
17607,Jonathan  Anning,as long as you do everything on blackboard show up for class he gives points for you being there and just study do juust fine willing to help and there are always open labs for you to go to take advantage of those great
17608,Jeff  Lynn,dr lynn is a very engaging speaker but sometimes he is not always appropriate during a lecture on ethics he made us pull out our phones and show him our facebook pages he said he wanted to check them for ho pictures it is not his business what we do on our personal time this was during a lecture on ethics
17609,Jeff  Lynn,excellent professor humorous lots of energy and makes class interesting he is highly interested in ensuring that students understand the material in order to prepare you for the world after college he will explain things a million times if needed take him if possible
17610,Jeff  Lynn,great professor he will hellp anyone that asks
17611,Jeff  Lynn,very funny
17612,Jeff  Lynn,if i could marry one slippery rock professor it would be dr lynn
17613,Jeff  Lynn,a great teacher and willing to help if you ast word to the wise dont get behind
17614,Jeff  Lynn,i love dr really seems to care when he helps sit and explain something to you a million times if he has to he relates stuff to everday college things great man by far one of the best teachers ever had
17615,Jeff  Lynn,able to explain things well by relating them to the classmates can tell he really knows and loves the information he teaches wants you to understand everything so that you could also teach a class about it
17616,Jeff  Lynn,the class was easy if you attended and paid attention and if there anything you understand he helped out as much as he could made class very fun and always interesting easily the best professor had so far at sru
17617,Jeff  Lynn,started out invested but then started acting like he really care dried up all ready
17618,Jeff  Lynn,he is very unhelpful and is the worst prof i ever had
17619,Jeff  Lynn,very interested in actually having his students learn even if its not on the syllabus he will gladly spend time to discuss topics related to the class or exercise in general if it will benefit the class and if its interesting for the students very available outside of class
17620,Jeff  Lynn,no comments
17621,Jeff  Lynn,no comments
17622,Jeff  Lynn,hes the best prof ive had here
17623,Jeff  Lynn,very nice guy very good teacher he is enthusiastic he is not in it to trick you very helpful and knowledgable
17624,Jeff  Lynn,a new professor in this department thus far the course taking seems simple very helpful and still has that zest newer professors have before they dry up
17625,Fred  Smoler,fred smoler is by far one of the finest professors in slc i was a part of his class by complete chance and was so glad to be in his class wait to take his alternate history class coming up this semester he is a brilliant teacher and truly inspirational
17626,Fred  Smoler,this was my class and i liked it but it was a ton of reading it was also difficult for me to focus in the lectures it was a bit too much for me glad i took it and sure a seminar would be very different
17627,Fred  Smoler,if you are a serious student or even if you are a slacker fred will amaze you fred is the ideal professor to do conference work with several times i have forgotten to speak in class because i loved listening to him talk
17628,Fred  Smoler,i took four separate classes with fred and he was without a doubt the single best teacher ever had at any level he knows everything about everything always has a book recommendation can hold court for hours take whatever you can with him particularly his more historyoriented classes
17629,Fred  Smoler,fred is a walking encyclopedia with a dry sense of humor anytime you hear a negative review always from a student who keep up with him a brilliant man who expects to be teaching brilliant students the quintessential professor a legend and deservedly so
17630,Fred  Smoler,brilliant scholarly guy his seminars are really just lectures with fewer students but he can be entertaining to listen to and you can learn a lot from him had trouble keeping up with what he said sometimes though assigns tons of expect to get it all done be prepared for intense conference work
17631,Fred  Smoler,fred is like getting sparknotes on steriods he is one of the smartest professors on campus and probably gotten more out of one of his classes than many other combined
17632,Fred  Smoler,well spoken and very smart but has a gigantic ego group conferences were just mini lectures written evaluation is based only on the second class paper
17633,Fred  Smoler,it get any better than fred brilliant hilarious and can keep a lecture hall thoroughly stimulaeted deepvoiced big on the tweed and the only person i have ever heard use the words polemical and together in a sentence fred satirizes an archetypal professor walking the walk but actually being much much better
17634,Fred  Smoler,very true one of the best
17635,Fred  Smoler,one of the best professors on campus
17636,Fred  Smoler,great guy
17637,Sue  Sipple,prof sue is the best professor i have ever had she is so willing to go out of her way to help students and make sure they succeed you have to write word papers each class but they become pretty routine and are simple she is very knowledge but you have to come to class ready to discuss and listen i would definitely recommend her
17638,Sue  Sipple,sue is very kind and is always willing to help students the class is very easy you basically just write word papers each week about the reading and talk about it in groups the exams are written and there is a final paper and essay exam overall the class is easy and definitely interesting even if you do not care for literature
17639,Sue  Sipple,dr sipple is absolutely amazing her discussions are always interesting and never fail to get me thinking i love most of the books read and she brings up points that i have thought of otherwise in addition to this super understanding and kind recommend her any day
17640,Sue  Sipple,i love professor sipple i have taken classes with her and would take as many others as i could she is very fun and engaging and she is super easy to talk to she is willing to help you raise your grade and as long as you do your response papers and participate a little she is very easy
17641,Sue  Sipple,best english professor at ucba very helpful and provides good feedback with all of the papers total of three papers and a reflection letter
17642,Sue  Sipple,sue is the best professor ucba has her knowledge is astounding and she communicates and interacts with her students in life changing ways i would definitely take her if you get the chance
17643,Sue  Sipple,professor sipple is an awesome professor she is very down to earth wonderful positive attitude about life in general and sympathetic to the college life if you need an extention on a due date she is very understanding extremely helpful and encouraging to her students she wants us to learn and succeed i definitely recommend her
17644,Sue  Sipple,great professor you can write about really whatever you want in the papers very open minded
17645,Sue  Sipple,awesome sweet lady her class is laid back you have papers you have a peer revision on all then you turn it into her for audio feedback she gives great feedback you have until exam week to revise all papers for a final grade i wish i could take her class again
17646,Sue  Sipple,sue sipple is is witty humorous and easy to talk to she is understanding if you have a good reason to turn in an assignment late she makes everything clear i would recommend her to anyone interested in actually learning something new
17647,Sue  Sipple,had her for topics in lit ii holocaust lit she handled this topic with humility understanding and professionalism even appropriate humor engages her students a rare and exceptional caliper of teacher recently won a welldeserved award for her teaching on sabatical now but will be back soon an exceptional classroom experience yes
17648,Sue  Sipple,i think she is a good professor she makes me feel like she knows everything i like the way she teaches the class i liked her assignments and her audio comments however i think she is a hard grader
17649,Sue  Sipple,one of the best english professors taken she is very helpful and will answer any questions you have and she makes class interesting harder class though it takes work and you have to write a response paper to every reading essay exams attendance is mandatory
17650,Sue  Sipple,a true professional her class discussions are interesting and thought provoking and the material is interesting you will have to write a short response paper to every reading and write a final paper as long as you pay attention and participate you will do well
17651,Sue  Sipple,best english class i ever took
17652,Sue  Sipple,very very helpful but she grades very hard on the final papers she is a great teacher but she does not tell you everything about your paper when you hand it in in addition she does not tell you your grade through the entire semester
17653,Sue  Sipple,i took sipple spring quarter in i really really enjoyed her class so i took her again fall quarter of she is a very approachable professor her classes are mostly discussion but almost always interesting also willing to look over and give advice on rough drafts of their final papers before due
17654,Sue  Sipple,i had sipple for english and i took her again for because i really liked her she was really helpful and let you go back and fix papers before turning in your final one i highly recommend her especially if you are a strong writer
17655,Sue  Sipple,had her for winter and spring quarter very nice professor and helpful as well if i have a chance to take another class she teaches i will do so
17656,Sue  Sipple,impossible to not like her good talk down to students bad unfortunately now i want her to teach all my classes she is very likable and easy to talk to and while she keeps the line drawn more like a friend than a teacher bad only because hard to not want to have her as a friend great person
17657,Fred  Williams,do not take any class this man teaches he is horrible and does not teach you one thing he gave many people and incomplete in my class because he changed the date of the final with no warning and has refused to answer my emails or phone call it has been almost months and i still dont have a grade
17658,Fred  Williams,i past but i cant tell you any thing about the class i can tell you that williams owns some property and some other personal things about him well i quess the class was about him
17659,Fred  Williams,cant stand is the biggest is make any effort for studentswell unless the old lady in the front row that thinks does love to help her and addresses every lecture to her only.wmsstick to
17660,Fred  Williams,this was the worst class ever i had him days a week bc i had of his omg he still recognize me and if you wanna just hear stories about himself and learn nothing
17661,John  Douglass,prof douglass is one of a kind i guess when you sign up for the class it says strictly a lecture must have missed the memo the most boring class ever taken though if you like to listen to a monotone voiced man speak for an hour straight then go for it he does not use blackboard or handouts either only six grades for the semester
17662,John  Douglass,prof douglas really knows his info obvious that he enjoys teaching the class was strictly a lecture class which is told on the registration website so if your expecting a hands on exciting class almost common sense to not sign up for a lecture course unlike much of the class i attended every day and took notes i got an easy a
17663,John  Douglass,if you need history classes do not take douglass he is not helpful he is condescending he answer questions clearly the only grades for the semester are four book quizzes a midterm and a final he grades very subjectively many times you know why he deducts points i know of anybody who earned an a in this course
17664,John  Douglass,very boring class only lectures for the whole class and sometimes pass the class time monotoned uses the word uh a lot avoid if you can his quizzes and test have hardly anything to do with the notes google helped me decently rude and not very happy space out once he starts talking its hard not too
17665,John  Douglass,the lectures are long boring and filled with information that you to know but attendance is mandatory he gives for the semester but his grading scale makes no sense use at all in a minute lecture that ended minutes early i kept a tally for every time he said um it ended up being
17666,John  Douglass,prof douglass seems to have social awkwardness which everyone seems to define as he seems very particular about his notes and wont defer if you have a question he is notorious for saying is in the and then wont answer wasnt hard work was hard to figure what he wanted he is monotone just reads notes very dull class
17667,John  Douglass,avoid at all costs he is a very rude and boring old man his test has nothing to do with the material minute lectures feel like days honestly if his class is the only class that makes you a full time student be better to stay part time
17668,John  Douglass,not a great speaker we use our class book at all required reading is a big part of this class lectures are long and boring he seems awkward and says um times per class take another professor
17669,John  Douglass,he is very monotone and not very helpful only test grades and a lot of reading
17670,John  Douglass,the worst lectures to be present for so monotone and boring asks if there are any questions and then acts like you are inconveniencing him when you actually do have one i would never recommend his courses to anyone
17671,John  Douglass,mr douglass knows his material and could make it very is no room for converation straight notetaking class if you like to write this is the class for you all essay and memorization good luck
17672,John  Douglass,professor douglass is the worst professor i have ever had do not take his class attendance is mandatory you get three skips then he says you fail the class hard to understand use blackboard or power points never smiles need i say more find another professor so you actually have hope of passing history and not having to retake it
17673,John  Douglass,what ever you do do not take this class prof douglass is so unbelievably rude does not care about his students and acts like it is such an inconvenience if you ask him a question does not respond to emails and make black board available boring lectures quizzes plus midterm and final read the book if you want a chance in passing
17674,John  Douglass,one of the worst professors i have ever had he even make blackboard avaiable so nothing is on there he respond to his emails he calculate the grades until the end of the semester oh and his class contains only book quizzes that is it no other assignments or points he just needs to retire because clear lazy
17675,John  Douglass,douglas is a very monotone person lectures were boring and he never seemed like we wanted to be there you read history novels as well as the textbook give a sheet that provides the exact questions on the test the was probably the best part about him dreaded going to his class
17676,John  Douglass,very difficult to understand what he is saying but he gives you s review sheet for each and if you follow that pass i even listen to what he lectures becuase more than half will never be on a test
17677,John  Douglass,very difficult to understand and did not make the class interesting
17678,John  Douglass,he was boring to an extreme not to say he did not know his stuff because he did however he tells you everything details you do not need to know or care to he speaks slowly and tends to repeat nouns instead of ever using pronouns was just slow and boring not recommended
17679,John  Douglass,when i read that dr douglas was a good adviser it shocked me any time you visit it seems like he is inconvenienced along with that he even explain how to add a had no interest except to push for credit hours no faith in abilities he should be thankful for tenure
17680,John  Douglass,very old fashioned style he was my intro back into college after years i love amer history so this helped he never smiles and i even asked him if he enjoys teaching tests are all essay timed and hard but if you study and read you will do well hot room monotone voice no discussion drink lots of coffe to stay awake
17681,Bill  Marsh,he is thee best stats teacher in all of uc i highly recommend him
17682,Bill  Marsh,very helpful
17683,Bill  Marsh,he has a few but theirs tests and you need to study from the book and do the problems o you will have problems i would recommend him
17684,Bill  Marsh,i recommend you take this professor for business stats in the summer he is unclear about the information given in the class he may be better in a regular quarter
17685,Bill  Marsh,attendance mandatory just necessary to to understand and pass he explains things better than the book and he put notes on blackboard
17686,Bill  Marsh,he is a very nice man seems interested in helping sometimes he gets confused and be sure to go over the tests makes several mistakes on grading
17687,Bill  Marsh,pretty easy goin guy tests are easy and he is always more than willing to help i would recommend taking him to anyone
17688,Bill  Marsh,he is so boring that it is everything i can do not to fall asleep in his class he explain anything so if you take him make sure you have a buddy in the class to get together with and study on your own
17689,Bill  Marsh,close your eyes and swear winnie the pooh was teaching a very caring and pleasant professor who makes sure you get through with a good grade
17690,Bill  Marsh,he is the sweetest old man he will do anything to help you out fair and very nice
17691,James  Cebula,obviously loves history this class is not an easy a but you can do well if you go to class and do the reading on the historical analysis papers important to show that you understand why they are historically relevant rather than just regurgitate them
17692,James  Cebula,i got both quarters i took him so it is not impossible you just have to read the text i enjoyed his class it was boring at times but you can tell he is trying and he really enjoys history he is a little scary but once you get to know him he is actually very understanding he was a lot better than any of the other history teachers
17693,James  Cebula,he is a very good professor when it comes to learning but if you are looking for an easy class he is not it he does not let anyone fail no matter how late an assignment is and he is always willing to help out when you struggle he does have a mean side sometimes
17694,James  Cebula,he was terrible he just rambled on for his lectures i read the textbook and still do very good on the quizes
17695,James  Cebula,he was terrible he just rambled on for his lectures i read the textbook and still do very good on the quizes
17696,James  Cebula,horrible class you only were graded on test and a paper both the test were essays and the paper had to be at least pages long and that include the foot notes or resource page he was a hard grader and he had his favorites in the class i would never take him again
17697,James  Cebula,easy class if you do the reading and take notes great professor knows his stuff and makes it interesting relates it to current events i will definitely take him again
17698,James  Cebula,he is not my favorite instructorbut he bad he really knows his history it is not an easy class if you work hard though his class can be quite rewarding
17699,James  Cebula,horrible experience in his class i felt like he did not want to help the students have a better understanding of the subjects he just rambles on and on and thinks everyone should know what he knows about history before entering the class quizes are not easy like others might say horrible
17700,James  Cebula,i took douglass and spraulschmidt for the first two quarters but cebula for the part of history sequence i did the best in his class and felt i learned the most multiple choice quizzes arent bad if u read essay exams are challenging but just know major points of the chapters i ended up getting a b in his class decent amount of effort
17701,James  Cebula,been a few years so see if his policy is still the same a quiz each chapter no midterm get an a average on the quizes and use that in place of the final a long paper best class participation ever since quizes mean so much everyone reads and is prepared for class i been in a class since where i felt everyone took in so much
17702,James  Cebula,not a bad professor tests are very hard quizes too bad if you read tests are essay answers seems like he like to give out to students he will always find somthing wrong with your essays had to work pretty hard to get a in the class i take him again
17703,James  Cebula,i love prof cebula such a great guy the absent minded professor extremely intelligent has great stories hard quizzes exams are challenging but he grades fairly he challenges his students to think if looking for an easy class go elsewhere whoever said boring possibly care about the
17704,James  Cebula,boring guy
17705,James  Cebula,a nice guy kept me interested even with my lack of sleep hard grader and tests are difficult but still a good class and professor
17706,James  Cebula,lots of lectures boring lectures however fair grader
17707,James  Cebula,boring lectures easy grader
17708,James  Cebula,not interesting went into tons of boring depth quizzes sucked and exams sucked worse not a fair grading policy
17709,Melanie  Grosser,amazing professor my favorite professor at ba and main campus super friendly and extremely encouraging easy a uses real life experiences in her discussions everyone is always involved in discussion which makes this class so fun to go to she cancels class frequently and cuts class short which sucks because i love this class so much
17710,Melanie  Grosser,she is very kind so it is really easy to talk to her about things that are unclear she uses areas of her work to help explain certain topics better although it is easy to get an a in her class its just as easy to get an f if you dont show up or do the work
17711,Melanie  Grosser,can use on exams check bb before class cancels frequently also dismisses early every day until end of semester child development was an easy class with her an easy a if you know how to write papers well enough
17712,Melanie  Grosser,a modern superwoman juggling a phd a private practice and some classes extremely kind and easygoing very intelligent and thoughtprovoking always left feeling like my mind had expanded a bit tells great stories and examples if i had met her earlier probably pursue a career as a therapist you get what you put in as always
17713,Melanie  Grosser,chd dvlp at baenjoyed class good at explainingrelates lectures to real life with interesting examples likes class participation exams are take homebased on textlectures helps to read text beforehand for exams exams group observations start early paperagain would start early in semester to choose topicresearch
17714,Melanie  Grosser,she was very nice and her class was easy enough two take home exams that need your book for and three paper all of which being relatively short she does get a little sidetracked during her lectures but not too much to not get through the notes i would definitely take her other courses teaching if need be
17715,Melanie  Grosser,take her class for an easy a she gives lots of stories to keep you interested easy graders and rarely assigns homework when she does she gives you full credit just for turning it in very friendly as well
17716,Melanie  Grosser,amazing i loved my intro to social welfare she is an amazing professor
17717,Melanie  Grosser,i took one psyc class in high school and learned college class learned a litle.i learned so much from her i love her class.she makes sure her students understand the they look puzzled she will explain it in a different way.and she made class enjoyable.the tests and the projects are pretty easy highly recommend her
17718,Melanie  Grosser,easy class but learned something from it
17719,Melanie  Grosser,awesome teacher very knowledgeable very experienced very easy just show up to class and get an easy a she gives you take home exams basically open book the final was open notes so tremendously easy you cant fail this class get out of class early almost every class awesome
17720,Melanie  Grosser,great teacher
17721,Melanie  Grosser,smart lady really knows her stuff she does a lot of hands on learning and discussions you usually get out of class early too
17722,Melanie  Grosser,wonderful prof always got out of class early simple take home exams and was allowed to use notes on final in class easy a

17725,Melanie  Grosser,no comments
17726,Melanie  Grosser,so easy just do the work even if u mess up on tests she will drop the bad answers great prof
17727,Mark  Critoph,beyond incompetent and basically phonedin every class really could care less about the culture of design or the world we were getting into belongs more in an avantgarde art exploration class then one devoted to design and its history is openly antagonistic rude and disinterested in his students
17728,Mark  Critoph,i hate him an so damn picky and mean to his class he also thinks he is so much better than his students be scared to challenge this guy he deserves it
17729,Mark  Critoph,i loved having him as a teacher mark is really into craftsmanship and work that has time and care put into it if you care about the quality of your work then he will mark accodingly respect him and you will be respected
17730,Mark  Critoph,no comments
17731,Mark  Critoph,a flippin moron
17732,Mark  Critoph,ok
17733,Mark  Critoph,no comments
17734,Mark  Critoph,he is teaching himself not teaching student he is talking to himself only hardly to listen what is talking about
17735,Mark  Critoph,no comments
17736,Mark  Critoph,the class design culture only has teachers available to teach it the other teacher is fine the other is mark who is rude arrogant brags and very defensive and aggressive in response to a he hates computers also
17737,Patricia  Buckley,very lax in explaining what she expected no written syllabus showed favoritism no text
17738,Patricia  Buckley,great teacher loves her students if you respect her go to the end of the earth for you she makes sure that the assignments given are portfolio quality deffinatly not a waste of your time she is a fair grader if you do your work and attend class even invited our class to her house at end of the semester great teacher great person
17739,Patricia  Buckley,alright a little intimidating and she plays favorites but over all not bad very into multimedia and if not then you better learn to love it i dont think i ever had one plain drawing everything had to have paint pastels washes whatever she likes what she likes attendance is crucial
17740,Patricia  Buckley,i loved her class one of the best teachers had take her water based media class
17741,Jenni  Marshall,i did not like this class at all the point value given to most assignments is not enough for the amount of work that you have to put in the instructions are not all listed but you receive a lower grade because she did not give all of the information gives chances to redo assignments for a better grade but doesnt give enough points
17742,Jenni  Marshall,great loved her would take her again
17743,Jenni  Marshall,ok on reg assignments her tests are the problem seems she wants students to fail her exam reviews do not pertain to the test material she takes the simplest thing and complicates it to the point of confusion she constantly mispronounces words all attendance taken within the first seconds of class be late will deduct points
17744,Jenni  Marshall,lots of assignments very thourough when reviewing for test
17745,Jenni  Marshall,taking this class right now and regret it was an a student and i am struggling in this class reviews for test but nothing you review is on the test makes simple things questions are up to your interpretation and even some questions not in the book you can know the material and still miss the questions
17746,Jenni  Marshall,not clear about what she wants she will give an assignment to complete the assignment is worth approx test grades make sure you are clear on her assignment if you have and have a good knowledge of the chapters and do bad on her assignment you will get a low c
17747,Jenni  Marshall,she is an excellent teacher i took her week class in the summer i had to work hard but i was never bored in her hour classes she teaches with power point video overhead discussion and presentations all in the same class if you want to learn and do not mind working for the grade take her you will retain the knowlege years from now
17748,Jenni  Marshall,the class was easy but horribly boring she has a background in counseling so she knows what shes talking about but she doesnt know how to teach it she has stupid activities and an obsession with dumb discovery channel movies she cant pronounce chromosome and doesnt know what the hell shes talking about when it comes to genetics.dont take her
17749,Jenni  Marshall,you can tell by the way the person above spelled extremely they just may not be that smart her class was fine you just need to go
17750,Jenni  Marshall,extreamly boring she does not make clear what she wants you to do and then when you do it you get a bad grade
17751,Jenni  Marshall,not very interesting pretty easy but class drags on forever seem like a very empathetic person
17752,Jenni  Marshall,boring weird but kinda easy
17753,Stan  Sulkes,i am his students in china he is very very cool strongly recommend him
17754,Stan  Sulkes,very nice reccomended fo sho
17755,Stan  Sulkes,he is a jerk he picks favorites i worked my tail off doing papers i did everything he said and he gave me a c on everything i did even when i asked him to please tell me what i need to change during peer editing i would recommend not wasting you time and pick another teacher
17756,Stan  Sulkes,he is really cool the only way you could fail this class is if you tried to on purpose i would definatly recommend him
17757,Stan  Sulkes,he is a really cool professor i am taking him again the class is very laid back but it seems like you are not even finished writing one paper and he is assigning the next its not bad at all though i would recomend him
17758,Stan  Sulkes,i love stan so much you have no idea the best especially compared to a witch like prof cruise never take her never
17759,Stan  Sulkes,i like this professor yes he will give your papers back and allow you to review it for a better grade he is very flexible and the class is very laidback you have homework once in awhile but never strenuous and you learn i recommend him
17760,Stan  Sulkes,revise get a better grade no matter what
17761,Soong  Sohng,the absolute worst ever had i understand things he says constantly goes off topic very unorganized i got an a in macro the semester before and struggling in this class avoid this guy at all costs listen to what everyone else says i could tell you his favorite kind of beer but nothing about econ
17762,Soong  Sohng,horrible teacher stay away i never had econ before but i studied so long for every test and never passed even people that had econ before were barly passing at withdrawl timehe told me to stay in because he will bump everyone up and i still recieved a d cant understand one word he said he doesnt use a book but you need to buy it to understan
17763,Soong  Sohng,very hard to understand makes the information more confusing
17764,Soong  Sohng,this was a really easy class i took it presession and studied for about mins for each test and got on all the tests if you go to class and pay attention super easy sohng a bad teacher
17765,Soong  Sohng,sohng is the worst professor on campus he may be funny at times but if he would cut out the bs and just teach this class would only take minutes because thats about how much he teaches everyday stay away from him for sure unless you are some econ genius this guy quit teaching a long time ago but yet still has a job weird
17766,Soong  Sohng,econ is a boring class as it is but why are most of the professors foreign and impossible to understand he talked about butter and guns during one of the first classes and i had no idea what he was saying i quit going just study the grapsh in the and get a c
17767,Soong  Sohng,very hard to understand outlines exam before test day his lectures were horrible so i followed along in the book and kept notes that way which helped
17768,Soong  Sohng,i hated this class it was so boring and i had a hard time making myself go but i hate econ in general some of his stories were funny though not that that helped my grade any
17769,Soong  Sohng,dr soong cracked me up he kept the class interesting it was a very hard class for me and to make matters worse i took it in presummer session very fastpaced which made it harder but i passed i think soong is hilarious
17770,Soong  Sohng,guaranteed to be the worst professor i have ever had in semesters of college not only is he ignorant to the beliefs of many of his students while making fun of those beliefs on top of all of this he will admit to being wrong on a test question and still will not give you the points for it any questions please contact jim in the computer lab
17771,Soong  Sohng,i loved this class unlike the rest of these people if you go to class pay attention and do the handouts you will do fine i hate stats and managed to get an a in his class and i believe it had nothing to do with me being a girl he even know my name how could he just give me a good grade
17772,Soong  Sohng,not very good he can hardly speak english or understand anything
17773,Soong  Sohng,hated this class he is nice and knows a lot but i could never understand him at all but i hate econ
17774,Soong  Sohng,the guy was an a hole not only was he my prof he was my advisr the guy would sidtrak al the time in class n flirt wit grls in the clas he was corny didnt xplain nuting as an advisr evn wors my fresman yr i went to him not nowin nutin n insted of helpin me pik clases n telin me bout them he jus circled clases n tol me to take them xplainin them
17775,Soong  Sohng,he frequently degrades christianity i think that he is a bad person i think he is struggling not a bad teacher economics is hard
17776,Soong  Sohng,i loved his examples and the way he would crack himself up this class was hard but no he is a bad teacher but the material is difficult
17777,Soong  Sohng,sohng not steve awesome so funny in his own way lol always smiling and willing to help i love how personal he is with the students so incredibly smart and loves to talk in and out of class my favorite teacher in clarion
17778,Soong  Sohng,just becuz he is a foreign teacher doesnt mean hes stupid hes very smart in his way he is just little struggling sometimes becuz of his little accent not becuz hes stupid duh
17779,Soong  Sohng,his name is soong sohng not steve a funny guy rather be stupid and drink beer than be a smart professor but got a good way of teaching and examples are of guns n butter nazi speech
17780,Soong  Sohng,
17781,Kenneth  Rockensies,this guy is the worst he makes all the students rewrite nova made a bad choice no wonder why hes at a different college every year
17782,Kenneth  Rockensies,he made it interesting
17783,Kenneth  Rockensies,very kind man and helpful
17784,Kenneth  Rockensies,the best and the nicest and really helpful
17785,Robert  Eierman,super great professor makes expectations clear is very willing and wanting to help students explains concepts in understandable and constructive ways get much better
17786,Robert  Eierman,dr eierman is just okay sometimes he expects you to know everything and when you ask help from him be you should know this yeah if i knew everything i come to you and ask for help his test are pretty okay if you study well from his study guides
17787,Robert  Eierman,dr e is a super nice guy but i think he should be teaching lower level chem he just assumes that we already know what talking about so he explain anything tests are all short answer which is actually beneficial because you can somewhat bs
17788,Robert  Eierman,chem was a little tough his notes are sporadic and random he goes out of the book so depend on your notes he very clear about most things but he does love what he does the tests ask a lot of random minor things you barely cover so know everything he has a major grading curve so that is nice but the tests are pretty tricky
17789,Robert  Eierman,i like this class so the he my favorite teacher but i heard he was ok for other classes
17790,Robert  Eierman,eierman is a nice guy he loves what he does and obvious however this class is hard and his tests are the most difficult i have ever seen this course is definitely geared more towards chem majors than any other very helpful when you ask so be afraid otherwise pretty much on your own good luck
17791,Robert  Eierman,eierman is a nice guy he is willing to help and answer questions all the time hard to follow most lectues in class so reading on your own is essential to get an a or b overall good teacher if you are willing to put effort in
17792,Robert  Eierman,he seems like too smart to teach an entry level chemistry class although i like that he gives goals and objectives sheets before tests he do a very good job with explanation he goes off on tangents quite often he does demonstrations in class that are pretty cool he tries to joke around but seems a little bit uptight
17793,Robert  Eierman,this is the first time eierman has taught in awhile he was extremely unhelpful and came off very cold to students i had to learn almost every aspect of the material in this class on my own good luck
17794,Robert  Eierman,this is the first time eierman has taught in awhile he was extremely unhelpful and came off very cold to students i had to learn almost every aspect of the material in this class on my own good luck
17795,Robert  Eierman,eierman is a great guy he is extremely helpful at almost anytime of day exams and labs are kind of difficult but always answer questions good professor
17796,Robert  Eierman,eierman is a great guy he is extremely helpful at almost anytime of day exams and labs are kind of difficult but always answer questions good professor
17797,Robert  Eierman,i really enjoyed this class it was very difficult but eierman makes it very interesting and as easy as he can his demos are usually pretty cool and he makes it very clear what you will be tested on overall a very helpful prof
17798,Robert  Eierman,very hard prof i want to take both chem so i decided to get it all done with just chem is not my subject i had two tutors for this one class i ended up with a c i was so happy eierman is a very cool guy and awesome in lecture lab do some sweet demos in class study study study funny too great guy
17799,Robert  Eierman,this guy is pretty good i a huge fan of the material but who does like quant
17800,Robert  Eierman,he is the best proffessor i had my semester he is very helpful and approachable if you are willing to ask him s
17801,Robert  Eierman,teaches classes well go to class and lab and you should be ok
17802,Robert  Eierman,eierman makes it very easy to do well lets you use a notecard on every exam gives goals and objectives sheets for every exam that tell exactly what will be on the test hands out practice exams before the test and sometimes questions come exactly off the practice tests.if you have questions just ask very helpful
17803,Robert  Eierman,i really liked dr e i had him for two classes and found him to be helpful if you take the time to ask questions seems intimidating until you meet with him he does give difficult tests though
17804,Robert  Eierman,he rules in labs lectures are terrible the goals and objectives are good but he stick to them i dont even know what to study for his tests because he will be heavy in one area and not so in all the other i wasted my time on whatever i will end up with a b this sememster
17805,Stefany  Dreher,i liked this class a lot she makes you work for the grade with out a doubt but i like that she changes form class to xclass on whether there is alecture class disscusion or group activity
17806,Stefany  Dreher,experience counts and this lady has it
17807,Stefany  Dreher,nice lady really flaky read a lot from the book
17808,John  Shore,yes he is very cute gentleman he cares his students even when he no longer teach them
17809,John  Shore,most of are class failed all the tests
17810,John  Shore,he is such a cute guy a very nice and friendly teacher who really wants his students to do well and succeed he also is a teacher that wants to actually get to know his students very approachable and pleasant i was lucky to have him for two classes
17811,John  Shore,no comments
17812,John  Shore,john is so cute he have a greaterthanthou attitude like most teachers he has great life experience and is a true english gentleman he is very helpful and puts his heart into his teaching
17813,John  Shore,no comments
17814,Norbert  Bartel,very good professor his lecture is really interesting and he cares about his students have any question just ask him be sure to attend class and read his notes almost all of the test question come from his notes if your answer is really good he will give you extra mark
17815,Norbert  Bartel,professor is very nice and care students but the contents are absurd complicated universe is trying to be shown within one semester and test questions are enormous within limited time all in all you will not even expect where does the questions come from
17816,Norbert  Bartel,the reports were a little annoying and time consuming to do however most of the assignments were very reasonable the midterm was right from the notes and pretty straight forward and so was the exam the prof is nice and articulate go for it
17817,Norbert  Bartel,i took the radio astronomy course with professor bartel and i have to say he is one of the best profs ever had the course is very math heavy but if you do the assignments ask questions in class and listen to his lectures you will be okay he makes the material so interesting definitely learn something absolutely recommend bartel
17818,Norbert  Bartel,he really made class interesting and marked really fairly
17819,Norbert  Bartel,he is an awesome prof i lovee his class very interesting stuff and he makes them so easy to understand thanks prof bartel
17820,Norbert  Bartel,the best professor i have had at york he is so passionate about his work and extremely engaging one of the only classes that i found time flew by during lectures i would highly recommend rearranging your schedule to take his class if you go to class and read his notes you will do well he often reuses his quiz questions on the midterm final
17821,Norbert  Bartel,one of the best profs i have had at yorku he made it a goal to connect with every student and help them he is just so knowledgeable and enthusiastic he makes you want to learn more the material was quite difficult and at times he went through it quickly but he made you study it through his pop quizzes yorku is very lucky to have him
17822,Norbert  Bartel,one of my favourite profs he is such a great teacher and really makes this subject interesting he seems to show a lot of passion for astronomy he is quite helpful as well and very important that you attend his classes was participation marks when i was in class overall great prof
17823,Norbert  Bartel,terriblee
17824,Norbert  Bartel,as long as you keep up with the assignments and the labs you will do great also very generous with marks and insists on learning names overall a great prof and a great course
17825,Norbert  Bartel,he is a great prof
17826,Norbert  Bartel,an awesome prof as long as you go to class do the work get an a most of all in class he even gives hints as to what questions will be on exams oh and you can email him asking him questions and help you or take it up for the whole class really good i enjoyed his class
17827,Norbert  Bartel,i love professor bartel i thought he was such an interesting prof he had a tendency to focus a bit on astrophysics which is something that seen a lot of people did not enjoy but i personally loved it he is a very nice guy funny at random times very approachable
17828,Norbert  Bartel,patient and always provided extra information for those who were more interested in the science aspect it was a great course
17829,Norbert  Bartel,i dont understand him nor do i understand his accent did not enjoy the winter and missed hall like crazy
17830,Norbert  Bartel,honestly he is one of the most helpfull profs u can get at york i have spoken to him twice after class about prbs with the course and he halped me out and was very clear about it
17831,Norbert  Bartel,take it
17832,Norbert  Bartel,a genuine nice guy he even get mad when some idiot was shining a laser in his eyes hahah that was gold a year breadth required course is hard to teach and his knowhow is so above it that he comes off as boring but props to him i give him a thumbs up
17833,Norbert  Bartel,never slept better in my life
17834,Debra  Ferguson,very nice helpful class is fun easy to understand tests are horrible no amt of studying helped wording was crazy in clinicalsbest instructor on campus helpful nonintimidating learned soo much paperwork is crazy hard for her though very specific
17835,Debra  Ferguson,great instructor very helpful if you ask for the help

17837,Debra  Ferguson,very nice lady definitely knows what she is teaching as long as you study you will be fine in her class
17838,Debra  Ferguson,very good teacher
17839,Andy  Terry,dr terry is a great professor when it comes to knowing what he is talking about he is brilliant when it comes to finance but be warned his classes are tough no matter which class you take that he teaches if you are confused about something be afraid to ask he expects a lot out of you and for you to remember things from other classes
17840,Andy  Terry,dr terry is thorough and thought provoking you cover a good deal of ground in corporate finance in adv fin mgmt while the earlier courses are a little too easy this course is really excellent this course makes heavy use of case studies an excellent immersive tool best time to ask him questions is during or after class
17841,Andy  Terry,advanced financial management his class is hard he is very very smart and curves things he also let you sneak out if you dont know something he will dig it out and then teach you take notes and study often this is not a class you take lightly you will learn a lot and he lets you do things on your own and hold your hand
17842,Andy  Terry,dr terry is a horrible professor and like to make sure you understand
17843,Andy  Terry,he is hard to understand
17844,Andy  Terry,i had him for corporate finance in the mba program a hard class but i felt my hard work was well evaluated and rewarded by dr terry tests were very fair i learned a lot
17845,Andy  Terry,no comments
17846,Andy  Terry,a good teacher he just teaches courses that are hard to begin with taken him for corporate finance and will take him again for ebtrepreneurial ventures
17847,Andy  Terry,dr terry is a horrible professor he will tell you in a million words what could take seconds on a board his first test was chapters long he does not weed out the important information he relies on powerpoint for instruction and is lazy
17848,Andy  Terry,explains everything in a speedy manner like to make sure you understand just makes sure that you have heard what he said
17849,Martha  Zlokovich,read the guidelines at the end of each chapter and do the self tests online go to class and pay attention bring your clicker dr z is really nice and encourages you to pay attention and participate
17850,Martha  Zlokovich,you must attend class otherwise you will not pass the class pay attention in class because some questions on the test come straight from class her tests are quite hard and she really tell you what is going to be on the tests other than the tests the class very hard its mostly being in class and you get the points
17851,Martha  Zlokovich,she lectures you take notes in the notes is hardly ever on the test if you want to have to read every single chapter sign up for her class
17852,Martha  Zlokovich,i was really interested in this class but i love psychology dr z knows tons and tons about child development and she always answered my questions strict and likes things to be done a certain way but i learned tons through this course hard material and you have to read the book inorder to pass the class
17853,Martha  Zlokovich,the class information was overall easy but it is an entry level psych course however there is a semester long research project that her class has to do it lasts all semester and is extremely annoying if you want the semester project than take the class with someone else there was no tests but points everyday in class
17854,Martha  Zlokovich,for the love of god and the little children avoid this professor like the plague i went to talk to her about what to study after i failed one of her tests and she know i had failed her test in a years worth of classes i got eight and one c from her class wrong here
17855,Martha  Zlokovich,all around horrible experience bland boring rude and disinterested in her students she does not care about anything outside of her class an is a b she doesnt accept late work for any reason points out of hundreds is max extra credit grouchy mean and not a good teacher and she finds the most obscure info for tests
17856,Martha  Zlokovich,the tests are ridiculous all questions are out of the book and over stuff that she cover in class good to go to class though because the in class points add up and can help make up for points lost on tests
17857,Martha  Zlokovich,no comments
17858,Martha  Zlokovich,dr zlokovich i refuse to call her dr z is unhelpful disinterested in the lives of her students and on the verge of spiteful her tests have questions not covered in lectures the answers are buried somewhere in the pages of text each test covers take her class if already stuck with her just go to class and read the book
17859,Martha  Zlokovich,no extra credit she is pretty cold hearted when it comes to making up work no true class involvement although we had a couple of quick partner projects most of the work is busy work that support the material her lectures were dry and uninteresting if you get a class that uses a remote control for answers i recommend you drop it
17860,Martha  Zlokovich,she was a terrible teacher if you call her mrs instead of dr she chews you out she would post our questions online only hours before class she was not willing to help anyone with anything i would avoid her if at all possible
17861,Martha  Zlokovich,i thought she was a great teacher she really knows her material and uses a lot of examples to make it easier to understand the class does require work on the students part and going to class because of participation points and a few short quizs at the beginning of class make sure you do the main points and listen to lecture and youll be fin
17862,Martha  Zlokovich,dr z is a smart woman and her class is interesting but there is a ton of reading to prepare for the tests and quizzes quizzes are like every class meeting she will get pissed if you refer to her as dr z or dr zlokovich i recommend her
17863,Martha  Zlokovich,dr z is a very sophisticated professor her lectures are pretty good and interesting but her tests have nothing to do with her notes so you have to read the book very well also a lot of points are based on attendence
17864,Martha  Zlokovich,the worst teacher i ever had i got an a in the class because i was very interested in it she is kind of distant but can be nice if she knows you are trying
17865,Martha  Zlokovich,she not as bad as everyone says she is strict but the class that hard you have to read the book but the lectures bad you do have to show up for class bc she gives quizzes and participation pts her tests too bad she just uses sophisticated wording so as long as you can decode the wording the test is really not bad
17866,Martha  Zlokovich,she is hard and stubborn i would choose any other professor other than her
17867,Martha  Zlokovich,let all these bad comments scare you off i took adolescent psychology in the summer with dr zlokovich i needed the course as an elective for my doctorate and she was nice enough to add me to the class and adapt the assignments to meet my needs i studied hard but easily got an a in the class and learned a lot
17868,Martha  Zlokovich,seriously i want to warn everyone to choose any other professor for this class there are so many other delgado sebby heard that all of them are better if you are foolish enough to sign up with then you will suffer thru a semester of hell
17869,Patricia  Yancey,now known as patricia farrish amazing professor laid back understanding makes class fun light work load and you actually learn reviews are exactly what is on the test nothing will blind side you attendance is not mandatory but i enjoy being there this goes for any class she teaches taken her any chance i get
17870,Patricia  Yancey,going into this class i thought it was a blow off class that i just needed for my major the first day she tells you that she is notorious for giving too many ha it that hard of a class but you have to go and have to actually study she told me i would get an a and that the case when i got my final grades bitter
17871,Patricia  Yancey,great teacher very relaxed everything on the tests comes from the notes and she usually tells you what will actually be on the test
17872,Patricia  Yancey,this class is an easy a with that being said you do have to come to class you get points for being in class but that is the only way to get notes there are only test including the final i paper that is worth just as much as the test and a family shield she gives review sheets there is no way possible not to pass this class
17873,Patricia  Yancey,class is soo boring i keep my eyes open more then minutes in there goes over powerpoints every class class only consists of test which are hard to pass and are long a paper and a family shield the test are nothing like the reviews that she gives i wouldnt take this class
17874,Patricia  Yancey,she is so funny and makes class a lot of fun even if it is not something that interests you she makes class enjoyable and adds in a lot of jokes and fun talks if you participate her tests and projects are super easy book is never used because she hates the book read and take good notes which she gives you and youll do great
17875,Patricia  Yancey,this class was awesome she is a really cool teacher and is fun and easy to get along with you are definately entertained in this class everyday i totally recommend taking this class with her you will be happy you did plus we got out early almost everyday
17876,Patricia  Yancey,i have had multiple classes with yancy she is so funny easy going and always a pleasure to have granted her classes are pretty darn boring even she gets bored but good about letting the class go early if no one is staying awake so sweet and a fun class to be in easy grade take her
17877,Patricia  Yancey,great nice teacher she makes class fun and interesting while teaching
17878,Patricia  Yancey,it is borring as hell every class i want to kill myself for the test she make the review sheet in class but the test can be completelly different than the review sheet
17879,Patricia  Yancey,great class is very relaxed she understands things come up and is very willing to make it possible for everyone to acheive their desired grade funny can come off as a little arrogant but tells great stories cancels class a lot and lets us out early teaches what the class wants to talk about
17880,Patricia  Yancey,i love mrs yancey she is so funny class notes come in handy for the tests but other than that her class is a lot of discussions she is from mississippi and makes fun of herself and her family a lot which is refreshing take her if you can
17881,Patricia  Yancey,she is extremely easy not much work and only two tests all semester including the final
17882,Patricia  Yancey,this class was very easy but boring we only had about grades and they were all simple really need to go to class she gets most of her information offline and just lectures from that if you want an easy a take her if u want an interesting class
17883,Patricia  Yancey,i love love love this teacher she is very laid back yet she knows her material she try sugar coat it she states the facts there are test multiple choice and she your notes are your study guide this class is very easy if you come and do your notes and simply participate
17884,Patricia  Yancey,she is so much fun hilarious she is very good and picking up the mood of the classroom and if she feeling well or if she could tell the class was just in one of those want to go moods she would totally let class out she gives study guides for tests and goes over them in class
17885,Patricia  Yancey,she is my favorite teacher at semo down to earth and witty and very practical her tests are easy and her lectures are interesting
17886,Patricia  Yancey,yancy is a very laid back teacher do well in this course as long as you atleast try
17887,Patricia  Yancey,wonderful very practical she gives it to you like it is
17888,Patricia  Yancey,awesome awesome teacher ms trish yancey of the human enviroment studies department she is an wonderful teacher who has gone above and beyond for her studies she is down to earth and supports her students no matter what she likes to say bad words in class no regrets in ths lady fav teach
17889,Norman  Kinney,this class was not as difficult as everyone is saying you must read the assigned chapters or you will not pass his test are difficult but the other assignments were basically free points the forums are opinionated and the research paper too bad he seems annoyed if you email him
17890,Norman  Kinney,class content overall not hard forum posts are easy and are based off your opinion the test chapters questions with minutes you do the math you have to know it if not you are doomed but so much information it really is hard to know what he will test you on
17891,Norman  Kinney,such a boring teacher literally reads off the notes he gives to the class for the whole class in the corner of the room hope he gets canned
17892,Norman  Kinney,i took this class online it consisted of weekly forums a few tests and one paper i liked that the forum questions were easy to discuss and based on your own personal the tests were timed so it was necessary to study in advance in order to not run out of time the class was really easy for me
17893,Norman  Kinney,forum assignments are easy test are timed and difficult expect any help from this professor
17894,Norman  Kinney,i fee like he actually knew much about the subject drugs and behavior he read directly from the powerpoint he never was able to properly answer questions from students when they came up in class
17895,Norman  Kinney,this class was really hard to stay awake in but it was an easy a all you have to do is read the book go to class because you get participation everyday give you an excused absence unless you are at a university event if you like to sleep during class this is one that you can
17896,Norman  Kinney,i absolutely loved this course the textbook was great to read most days a page turner and dr kinney taught directly from it the tests were of no big surprise and i learned a lot it was great having the opportunity to scratch out five questions we did not want graded on all of our tests boosts the grade i would absolutely recommend taking i
17897,Norman  Kinney,this class is not that hard the only hard part is trying to stay awake listening to kinney lecture he is very boring but the material is not that dificult he reads directly off the slides and you can print off the notes i used the interactive website that goes alog with the book to study for all of the tests the final is not comprehensive
17898,Norman  Kinney,not a bad teacher just slightly boring possible to make an a in his class if you study hard for his tests complete the forum assignments and submit the page paper at the end of the semester
17899,Norman  Kinney,online course read textbook and you will be fine grades hard on papers forum assignments are easy but you must complete them
17900,Norman  Kinney,i would recommend this teacher the forum assigments do not take up much time and the papers that are due are not very difficult either all in all the tests are the hardest because it is timed and just definitions you have to understand the concepts he curves the grades too
17901,Norman  Kinney,i took online class py there is basically no work except on sundays when you have to complete a forum however the tests were hard u have read the chapters at least times to pass at least that is what he told me when i emailed him about my grade you have papers that are like pages long i suggest this class
17902,Norman  Kinney,the class was pretty boring but the material covered is pretty stimulating dr kinney teaches directly off the slides but he is very knowledgeable not a hard class at all if you read the study guides and go to class not much class interaction at all
17903,Norman  Kinney,my super ego is drawn to say he is a decent teacher for moral reasons but my id says he is the most boring teacher imaginable every class he reads directly from the powerpoints and tells stuff related to material he thinks is funny but isnt to pass his class you must always go to class and complete online work if you dont get as on his tests
17904,Norman  Kinney,the class material is very interesting and he is extremely knowledgeable although his teaching style is a little boring you learn a lot
17905,Norman  Kinney,extremely boring teacher all that he does is stand in front of the room and read the powerpoints his test are pretty hard but if you study you should at least get a c on them go to class and do the online forum and they will boast your grade you should at least get a c in the class if not a b
17906,Norman  Kinney,very boring teacher and really care about his students if you go to class and get your perticipation points and do the online assisgnments your get a b or c in the class the test are pretty hard and confussing though
17907,Norman  Kinney,i really enjoyed this class
17908,Norman  Kinney,loved loved loved this class it is alot of hard work but so very interesting lots of thinking involved i remember some in the class would leave completely exhausted from thinking too much wanting to bang their head on the wall you either love it or you hate it but you deny that he is an awesome teacher in my top of favorite teachers at southeast
17909,Tim  Dowd,professor dowd was one of the best professors i ever had the exams are question half half textbook and cover chapters each the final is not comprehensive so that helps definitely take for miami plan
17910,Tim  Dowd,he is awesome
17911,Tim  Dowd,i was in his first honors section and he def kept us busy with reading and papers overall a great guy but use his office hours if you get stuck
17912,Tim  Dowd,great teacher makes the lectures interesting the exams are half textbook all the exams cover chapters each the final is the same as the other exams not cumulative great class and amazing professor
17913,Tim  Dowd,tests are half from lecture half from the book so its necessary to read just going to lecture and not reading will not do you much good overall great teacher easy to talk to out of class
17914,Tim  Dowd,best professor ever even had our class over to his house for dinner
17915,Tim  Dowd,great teacher this was one of the most interesting and fun classes i have taken at mu he made the already interesting subject of psychology come alive and stick to your insides a great man that will always be a part of his students
17916,Tim  Dowd,best educator i have ever experienced
17917,Tim  Dowd,he definitely makes psychology fun and interesting five years later i still remember a lot of what he taught me
17918,Tim  Dowd,one of the best lectures taken
17919,Tim  Dowd,everyone always said how great he was i wish i would have showed up more to class i missed out on having had an awesome professor
17920,Tim  Dowd,dowd was an amazing professor and is dearly missed by faculty and students a legend he was fun to listen to and knew his stuff his tests easy but i enjoyed going to every class
17921,Tim  Dowd,one of the best educators i have ever seen with an outstanding passion for his students and the material he teaches i still remember lessons he taught in my freshman intro psych class and that was in fall of
17922,Tim  Dowd,dr dowd is one of the most memorable professors had at miami he cares for the students and enjoys what he does
17923,Tim  Dowd,he is the best teacher i have ever had i know he is dearly missed
17924,Tim  Dowd,i had him years ago and i still remember him being the most excellent professor i have had to be able to sustain the attention of a students in an intro to psych class is amazing he is the reason i chose psychology as my major
17925,Tim  Dowd,the best teacher ever had and will ever have
17926,Tim  Dowd,great teacher
17927,Tim  Dowd,had a bigger heart than any professor ever had be sadly missed
17928,Tim  Dowd,no comments
17929,Corinn  Columpar,prof columpar is a great lecturer very engaging and able to explain important concepts clearly eclectic choice of screening material be something for everyone tests exams and assignments easy but they are fair if willing to do the readings attend lectures and put the work in you should do well
17930,Corinn  Columpar,not easy grades but definitely fair if you study and do the weekly readings you will easily get an unless you good at writing papers prof has excellent lectures easily the best lecturer i had in my first year sums up the readings really gives great examples and is very clear with concepts she is trying to explain
17931,Corinn  Columpar,great prof very inspiring some found her lectures too boring but i really liked that she scripted it beforehand it cut down on rambling lectures were very useful more often than not there was new and interesting material readings were interesting syllabus was constructed well and assignments were light
17932,Corinn  Columpar,she is an amazing professor her lectures are clear concise and entertaining you can tell she is genuinely excited about what teaching she is also very smart the readings are important in this class as are the lectures which you want to miss
17933,Corinn  Columpar,she is the best professor ever seen her lectures are so organised and clear excluding using too many ornate vocabs
17934,Corinn  Columpar,overall a good teacher but really distracting and irritating when she uses a lot of obscure words especially since heard her use those words incorrectly or mispronounced them
17935,Corinn  Columpar,she is fantastic speaks clearly and gets all the concepts across in a stimulating environment i was unfortunate to only have her for the first semester as she went on mat leave as the other prof nearly as good if you have her you will not regret it
17936,Corinn  Columpar,so knowledgeable and so kind an amazing lecturer however a lot of what her lectures cover in cin105 intro to cinema studies is exactly what is covered in the readings
17937,Corinn  Columpar,great teacher and also a total babe
17938,Corinn  Columpar,corinn columpar was the best cinema studies professor i had at the university of toronto she is very confident in her understanding of film theory and she elucidates her thoughts eloquently and efficiently she made me see film in an entirely new way and grateful for the perspective she gave me take her classes
17939,Corinn  Columpar,the lectures and tutorials are a joke they consist of regurgitated summary of the text book chapters reading and quotes and she goes off into tangents about her interests in art history music a bit of a money grab scheme to intentionally force students to pay extra for academic readings when she could easily chose readings off of jstor
17940,Corinn  Columpar,beautiful passionate eloquent amazing
17941,Corinn  Columpar,stunningly beautiful
17942,Corinn  Columpar,great lecturer clearly enthusiastic about film and her passion rubs off on students very clear very helpful all in all awesome prof
17943,Corinn  Columpar,incredibly eloquent lectures spells out content in various ways with great examples very fair in expectations marking and rules in class very attentive to questions from students interesting and approachable uses very relevant information
17944,Corinn  Columpar,she does her lecture by reading off her notes with redundant vocabulary two assignments are not only time consuming but also being graded hard as hell pretend to be nice and mark very mean
17945,Corinn  Columpar,while doing lectures the material got lost in her unnecessary vocabulary that just made her sound pretentious the course tie in historical context or significance of our time which can make it seem like an overall useless topic i love movies but this course really turned me off to any future endeavours in cinema studies
17946,Corinn  Columpar,interesting lectures that provide an essential framework for deeper cinema study also great taste in music
17947,Corinn  Columpar,her somewhat boring complex lectures are absolutely necessary if you ever hope to get a grip on the material the course is harder than most work hard on the first essay
17948,Corinn  Columpar,great professor as knowledge goes but she is uptight and takes the fun out of the course this course is harder than political science just so you know
17949,Eric  Bushrow,no comments
17950,Eric  Bushrow,a lot of problems came from all of the sections having to do the same thing i think that it was his fault
17951,Eric  Bushrow,he has favorites in his class and he is not afraid to show them he does spend more time on their questions
17952,Eric  Bushrow,good labs lousy lectures
17953,Eric  Bushrow,no comments
17954,James  Arvo,he was probably one of the best teachers had so far he was clear and enthusiastic however i heard from a professor that he had passed away a couple of weeks ago which i sadly confirmed through an online news article on legacy.com that said he had passed on he will be dearly missed
17955,James  Arvo,best teacher i ever had
17956,James  Arvo,great teacher very clear and straightforward he is very organized and answers question very nicely the tests are stuff that are covered in so just go to all the class sessions discussions and do the homework and be fine speaking of which the homework is not too difficult like it was in eecs with lin
17957,James  Arvo,amazing class has an in depth understanding of the subjects and is a pioneer in the field of ray tracing and realistic image synthesis thew classes flow very smooth very comprehensible possibly the one of the best course taken
17958,James  Arvo,take him if you get the chance prof arvo is enthusiastic about teaching and is by far one of the best professors in all of uci
17959,James  Arvo,this course is time consuming and difficult but the nature of the course content after done all the projects you feel a sense of real accomplishment arvo delivers the subj in sizeable chunks that are easy to digest he understands the inadequacy of some background and accomodates best professor period rewarding course
17960,James  Arvo,the rest of the comments are spot on one of the best professors uci has to offer gently explains complex topics provides beautiful proofs and encourages good notetaking by providing clear explanations on the whiteboard always well prepared and very helpful during office hours take this course if you get a chance you regret it
17961,James  Arvo,inspired kind expert
17962,James  Arvo,one of the best profs here outstanding teacher
17963,James  Arvo,exceptional best class grad graphics ever taken
17964,James  Arvo,automatic extensions for homework assignments and open note lectures are pretty clear and is always willing to help tries his best to get the class involved during the lecture
17965,James  Arvo,great class very clear lectures focused on helping us understand the concepts in depth homework policy is very fair and ta was helpful every other professor at uci that taught about left me confused and scared eppstein looking at you but arvo made it clear and intuitive
17966,James  Arvo,i only took this class to get rid of a requirement but professor arvo made the class interesting also a really nice guy who printed out notes for everybody who came to class the notes are so good you probably have to go to class but his lectures make life eaasier on you
17967,James  Arvo,ics was one of the few classes i really enjoyed going to very pragmatic in what he taught but in a good way i highly recommend him for this course
17968,James  Arvo,truly inspiring never preaches shows you the door and leaves the rest for you to explore if i could go back to school again i will definitely love to learn more from him
17969,James  Arvo,one word awesome
17970,James  Arvo,really easy class the hw is worth of your grade midterm was easy but the final was harder read and ask ta if you have questions but if your ta sucks then good luck in the half of the hw
17971,James  Arvo,lectures were very boring and really apply to homework grading was hw midterm and final pretty hard class if never programmed before but really helpful and the tas try probably one of the best programming teachers however becasue he wants you to do well in his cla
17972,James  Arvo,the class was kind of iffy and what we were supposed to learn was kind of unclear then again it is kind of a weird filler cse class i guess but arvo tried his best tried to teach us as much as he could and was always willing to give us extensions or clarifications on hw problems good guy
17973,James  Arvo,awesome guy lectures really boring and he does have extensive knowledge about the subjects he teaches likes naming sample foo or bar heh i recommend him
17974,Robert  Edwards,cares for his graduate level classes but sure as hell couldnt care less about his undergrads its sad
17975,Robert  Edwards,no comments
17976,Robert  Edwards,if this is all you need for math requirements take it when u have and easy quarter definitely doable but not the most interesting proffesor go by what he lectures and his homeworks to succeed
17977,Robert  Edwards,dreadful
17978,Robert  Edwards,has a deep sense of the material and the wonderful ability to explain through examples very helpful
17979,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,she was not very helpful she was a hard marker but could not explain concepts well relied too much on the textbook
17980,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,prof wagman is a very nice lady but sometimes you know what to expect as long as you study the textbook content and attend class regularly be fine she specify which areas to study but fair as everything covered in class is test material the best part is that she will get you speaking spanish
17981,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,answer all of the questions in the textbook and rarely be stumped for an answer during class if you understand a concept consult the text book if you make a grammatical error be penalized heavily for it not interesting very very dry remember your vowels
17982,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,to be fair pr wagman did teach the class a lot and i understood her lessons mostly however there are several good reasons not to take her class if you make a mistake take a fit and make you feel awful i was a beginner and know any spanish last year am just glad to be done with her
17983,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,this professor is horrible i spoke minimal spanish prior to this class.this professor has ruined the language for me she explain things well and she expects you to be fluent she gets mad when you understand something friendly but not a good teacher for an intro class expects you to be fluent by the first week
17984,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,avoid this teacher juan carlos garcia is times better
17985,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,horrific teacher speak spanish the most horrifying teaching methods every class all she does is read every single word of the text book you cannot learn a language like that she has no vivid energy in her class everyday is boring as hell the worst language class i ever had
17986,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,i actually loved spanish prior to taking her class back in i actually had one of my majors in spanish after her course i dropped it faster than you can say arriba not kidding i dreaded going to her class once a week for three hours it was torture she is not vey exciting we did everything by the textbook just not fun at all
17987,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,unless your a native spanish speaker avoid her she seems unsure of her own language confusing too you never know for homework or on an exam and she likes essays very very clearly outlined thesis support etc otherwise she understand it she directly answer quesiotns either
17988,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,no comments
17989,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,seriously do your ask her what will be on the tests very specific about that to class and just be prepared because she does tend to pick on people ask lots of detailed questions at the end of the course because a lot to learn at the very helpful and went out of her way for me many
17990,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,a nice prof really very understanding and kind as a person but she marks so freaking hard and she expects you to show up for every class and puts you on the spot make sure you do your homework and read the textbook because the course is heavily textbook based if you do your homework she will hate you and pick on you d
17991,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,good
17992,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,boring boring boring avoid her at all costs she is a horrible prof not clear on what her expectations are boring boring boring that is all
17993,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,if you knew spanish before taking intro to spanish be fine if you then hard luck either way it was more useful to tune her out while she taught and teach yourself from the textbook substitute her with anyone who knows spanish grammar and you be any worse off just the same i got a great mark in her class
17994,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,a bit of a tough cookie in level she expects you to know the stuff from the intro course fair she just needs to be more explicit in her essay and test requirements people get for no apparent reason get me wrong if you know your grammar i mean know it study it be ok i already knew it so i passed
17995,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,she assumes you already know everything therefore her teaching skills suck
17996,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,just put it this way a disappointment in my attempt to perfect my spanish
17997,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,she is a nice lady her sense of humour takes some getting used to if she senses you are doing your work and trying hard she will encourage you if not look out one thing that really bothered me in this class is the fact that an intro to spanish class yet we have people who speak spanish in the class shame on you
17998,Anita  Wagman-Iscove,a nice lady but she needs to understand that we have more than just the one course we always keep up and read ahead before we go to her class but she thinks that you dont do work at all just becuase you cant answer her questions in class still an a student in spanish but i have lost my interest in this language
17999,Claude  Painter,claude is very thoughtful and intellectual with her teachings you can and will learn so much from her you can count on her if you have any problems of any sort she will be there for you with a genuine heart thank you for teaching us
18000,Claude  Painter,wonderful teacher she truly wishes you to succeed very approachable and lenient towards your need enjoyed her classes very much and all of her assignments were useful
18001,Claude  Painter,an awesome teacher overall.enjoyed going to her classes and very knowledgeable in the childhood field
18002,Claude  Painter,very nice teacher and have alot of experience in a child care field very patient and loving
18003,Claude  Painter,an awesome teacher and is really good especially when reading books to us she makes great sound effects too as she reads them the text is quite difficult to understand however so make sure u keep on top of it out of all the classes the text is an indepth analysis about acquiring language it tends to be hardtoretain
18004,Claude  Painter,nice woman she has a lot of experience around kids so she makes the class interesting
18005,Claude  Painter,amazing understanding helpful approachable kind and a great resource for students
18006,Claude  Painter,very supportive teacher
18007,Kathy  Stoessl,favorite instructor in the ece department professional but alao so caring and helpful she genuinely cares about her students she gives so much amazing that is so helpful if you really go over it always has time for students if they want to talk about a grade brings in personal experiences to compliment a great teacher
18008,Kathy  Stoessl,love favorite teacher ever she is the sweetest organized classes and notes cares for her students easy to approach and talk with her tests are easy if you take good notes during class
18009,Kathy  Stoessl,nice teacher if she likes you
18010,Kathy  Stoessl,information and content straight from text overheads rehashed version of text not funny at all very strict and has follow her or its wrong
18011,Kathy  Stoessl,very freindly and funny her notes and clear and organized which makes it easy to study for her exams
18012,Kathy  Stoessl,very nice and a supportive teacher
18013,Kathy  Stoessl,shesaniceteacher.sheiscertainlyveryknowledgebleabout thehistoryofearlychildhoodandcareshepracticallyhas all her material memorized at times she speaks a little sometimes i found her language to be incoherent just because she tends to use a lot of sophisticated vocabulary both when shelectures andalso onherxams.studyhardforherexams
18014,Kathy  Stoessl,not fair at all i would never take her class again
18015,Kathy  Stoessl,terrible teacher horribly unapproachable condescending and unsupportive
18016,Kathy  Stoessl,great teacher very funny
18017,Scott  Rose,great teacher everything he tests on is in his lectures that he has for you on his website extremely helpful and has the best interest in the students if you make the effort he will go the extra mile for you some of the information is a bit dry but if you put in the time you will learn so much seriously awesome teacher tough class though
18018,Scott  Rose,his lectures are so long and the lecture notes that he reads off of are filled with too much information that we even need to know he clearly specify what to know on exams and his exams have too many true and false questions which throw us all off a professor with a lot of knowledge but he should change some things
18019,Scott  Rose,rose is a very good teacher he is clear helpful friendly and gives you everything you need to get an a he types out all the lecture material for you and as long as you know everything on that you will get an a but he is tough expect to spend several days studying for each exam and lectures are long
18020,Scott  Rose,mr rose brings the world of the unseen to life in his microbiology class his attention to detail in lecture and lab is impeccable by the end of the course i feel that i knew a lot about infectious disease working with bacterial cultures in lab and safety mr rose is a kind and caring professor while maintaining rigor and professionalism
18021,Scott  Rose,if you have ever thought about dropping out of school this class will make you want to follow through with it
18022,Scott  Rose,loves to hear himself talk lectures are very long and boring he goes over every lab and film you watch thoroughly before you do the lab or watch the film which completely takes all the fun and curiosity out of it very redundant he will repeat things over and over again like you are a kindergartner and comprehend not my favorite class
18023,Scott  Rose,lectures are long if a visual learner have a hard time trying to learn all the information he gives you all the lectures are on his website in pdf format and exactly what he uses during his lectures rarely writes on the board tests are very tricky truefalse and matching if you love micro think about taking him
18024,Scott  Rose,rose is amazing helpful he really made me regain interest drive in my intended profession as a rn one of those teachers you will always class was tough but he makes the information fun he loves to ramble off about random but he is entertaining and opens your eyes to a whole new world in the healthcare field
18025,Scott  Rose,he is great record lectures will help and everything you need to know are in the lecture notes material can be very though but if you pay attention and study hard you can earn an a possible i did it and you can too he is an awesome teacher and very entertaining at times i enjoyed and learned a lot from his class
18026,Scott  Rose,dr.rose is really need to be recorded goes give lecture need to study every day and attendance is a studied alot only earned a b
18027,Scott  Rose,buy a digital recorder you will need it take good notes relisten to lecture rewrite your notes trade notes with someone else and do great prof rose is straight up honest and helpful more chill if you get into the pm lab easy to talk to seems harder than he is do the work and get a good grade you have to earn i
18028,Scott  Rose,careful about making mistakes in his class might yell at you my classmate was yelled at in front of us when she made stupid mistake just warn you to whoever might take his class
18029,Scott  Rose,too much information overwhelms students with the amount of information and do not give out any lecture notes lectures have some organization but for the most part are all over the place he is very intrested in the subject and gets excited when he lectures which causes him to talk fast while lecturing
18030,Scott  Rose,teacher that cares about his students very organized almost obsessed about it but a good thing because his lectures are organized but u may have to record his lectures because he gives so much info n leaves no time for daydreaming if u blank out for minute u are lost in space
18031,Scott  Rose,rose is sweet and an awsome teacher he cares about the success of his students i was nervous about this class since i took it in the summer my doubts were unnecessary though the class was hard i learned alot and managed a b i would recomend him in a heartbeat
18032,Scott  Rose,this teacher is easy but i learn very much
18033,Scott  Rose,anatomy physiology is a hard and exhasting class for most of us but prof rose is the best at explaining processes in a way that we all can understand thanx
18034,Joanne  Brown,no comment
18035,Joanne  Brown,a very nice and a lenient teacher understands the students problems
18036,Joanne  Brown,she was such a fun instructor we did a lot of hands on activities which helped us with our practicums relatively leanient about assignments ie extend dates if u have a valid enough reason she almost always has a smile on her face which makes the classes so much more her exams are pretty
18037,Joanne  Brown,her speaking not clear at all.one inclass part marks her teachin is quit boring her class discussions help alot also take notes of wat she said about stit asked in the more on idea than gramma
18038,Joanne  Brown,no comments
18039,Bruce  Hammond,best prof for econ knows his stuff well and interesting lectures
18040,Bruce  Hammond,hehehe
18041,Bruce  Hammond,his lectures were not helpful and the final exam was ridiculously hard other profs provided slides with detailed information to their students while bruce hammond only put a few graphs on his slides my friend is currently retaking econ1021 and you know what most of the people from that class were from bruce class last semester
18042,Bruce  Hammond,why were most of the recent bad reviews deleted bruce is probs reporting all these lol
18043,Bruce  Hammond,unreasonably hard exam fun fact rivers macro econ filled up right after final exam
18044,Bruce  Hammond,lets just say his lectures are a perfect example of diminishing marginal utility and my grade perfectly resembled an economies of scale graph
18045,Bruce  Hammond,i had hammond for micro in fall term and macro in winter term i thought he was a good prof and was able to get good marks in both classes however after a year it looks like that has all changed as i was reading all the comments for the fall micro term just goes to show how can differ year to year just be careful
18046,Bruce  Hammond,what can i say except for the fact that his disgrace of a professor told his students that going to intentionally make the average between most unreasonable prof who expects you to teach of the material yourself seriously go f yourself bruce
18047,Bruce  Hammond,hehe
18048,Bruce  Hammond,really enjoyable prof loved attending lectures and exams were really easy
18049,Bruce  Hammond,ive been doing the same lmao
18050,Bruce  Hammond,funny thing that everyone is complaining about him this year i definitely agree based on my experience in first year he is indeed heartless and does not care about his students
18051,Bruce  Hammond,i regret coming to western because of this man not only is he an awful teacher but he is a terrible person we pay all this money to get an education we put endless ours of studying in and no matter how hard you try you will not do well because he purposely wants his students to fail because of him i now have a negative outlook on western
18052,Bruce  Hammond,never have i met such a cold hearted man merry christmas to you too bruce
18053,Bruce  Hammond,for the final exam i read the entire textbook did all suggested problems went over the first two exams completely and all in all probably spent hours studying all of that was for nothing as the final exam was insane and unfair and it seems like bruce want anyone in his course to do well would recommend switching out of his class
18054,Bruce  Hammond,the only concept i learned in his class was the idea of diminishing return well he sure did a great job of helping us understand it in real life by making the class average exponentially lower each time we write the test
18055,Bruce  Hammond,would never take again
18056,Bruce  Hammond,litterly studied so hard and the final make any logical sense most of the questions were concepts that have never even been relayed in lectures or the textbook it was almost as if i wrote a completely different course exam that i knew nothing about guessed every question cried during it brutal experience
18057,Bruce  Hammond,terrible prof
18058,Bruce  Hammond,worst prof ever he doesnt care about his students lives i sometime question his true intentions
18059,Faye  Smyle,two things heavy reading and group projects though all of this in preparation for upcoming tests again the course mainly consists of heavy reading group projects tests and observation projects at the nvc child development center smyle is very lively and is understanding she is willing to help if you are confused with any of the readings
18060,Faye  Smyle,if you want a teacher that teach recommend her she gets paid way too much money to not teach us she good at explaining her content well and expects her students to keep up with her nonsense i love learning and had plenty teachers and she is not one i would ever take again if this allowed a what i would put
18061,Faye  Smyle,i have never read so much in my life so much reading and quizzes every class i took her one day a week class and it was so hard for me to keep a good grade a great professor and is passionate about the subject our class was really fun but she is a hard grader would not recommend taking her one day a week class unless you have to take it
18062,Faye  Smyle,i love her my boyfriend is in the navy and when i asked for a week off she told me this class is all about relationships enjoy your week with your boyfriend my favorite teacher by far she is amazingly kindhearted sweet and caring not to mention interesting hands on projects clear instruction and manageble work load
18063,Faye  Smyle,fantastic teacher supportive and great at getting her point across thought provoking and very passionate about her field contageous and what she teaches changes your views on children forever teachers get better than this
18064,Faye  Smyle,faye is a wonderful professor she is inspirational and very fair in her grading and treatment of students if you work hard she will reward you
18065,Faye  Smyle,very clear in objectives and expectations willing to help you help yourself one too many group projects though if a fan of lectures bother
18066,Faye  Smyle,no comments
18067,Faye  Smyle,she is an amazing teacher she brings alot of experience to her field and tells us how she dealt with alot of children she is always smiling
18068,Faye  Smyle,i really enjoy her class from an overall standpoint she is real clear and she gives a lot of examples which makes it easier to understand things
18069,Faye  Smyle,faye is a brilliant educator in her field she has the experience and wisdom to teach about child and family studies while the content of her course isnt hard the workload is demanding
18070,Faye  Smyle,faye is brilliant i love her views as a mother i learned a lot from her
18071,John  Charlesworth,before the tests i just studied the text book and i never got less than a on any of them because he gives you a free text book on the first day of class you do not need to take notes all the material he covers is right in the book this spring semester of is his last semester ever so npvc will lose one of their greatest professors
18072,John  Charlesworth,mr charlesworth is the best he is hilarious and knows so much about space if been daydreaming about the unknown take his class an easy a if you show up and do the work you have to study for the final or you may not pass he is available outside of class to help you if struggling as well
18073,John  Charlesworth,excellent teacher i have taken both his astr110 and astr11 and have enjoyed them both he keeps his lectures interesting and wellpaced throwing in the occasional corny joke just attend the lectures and make sure to study thoroughly before every test and the class is an easy a so hurry up and take this class before he retires
18074,John  Charlesworth,great teacher funny down to earth made the class very enjoyable and relatable he wrote the book himself which made it very useful
18075,John  Charlesworth,excellent teacher keeps my attention the entire class in his and has been teaching at the college for years he is a national treasure miss taking a class from him
18076,John  Charlesworth,very interesting and enjoyable class and teacher he does everything he can to be helpful but you have to attend and study every week highly recommended for serious students
18077,John  Charlesworth,if you fail this class you have no one to blame but yourself there is a ton of memorization astronomy what did you expect but everything that is on the test is in the textbook and mentioned in class his stories and corny jokes make it easier to stay awake since a night class too
18078,John  Charlesworth,we had to study a lot in this class take the class if looking for an easy a because you will fail his tests are mostly which i find harder than multiple choice questions his teaching style is quite hard to follow but you can tell he really has a passion for the subject our text is extremely helpful so use it
18079,John  Charlesworth,i really wanted to like his class but i like charlesworth better as a person than as a teacher.he just rambles on and on.he makes sense in class but if you read his book at home it gets confusing.i hate this class and not hard at all very easy going and wants to be helpful.i just cannot pay attention to anymore of his boring repetition
18080,John  Charlesworth,charlesworth is hilarious he loves astronomy and is very clear in his lectures he wrote his own textbook and all the material you need is in it aside from two star quizzes the rest of the material is pretty dense it is not an easy class a lot of studying is necessary but charlesworth makes the class entertaining
18081,John  Charlesworth,he wrote his own textbook and lectures out of it the whole night your grade will depend on point tests and star quizzes which depend on memorizing not an easy a unless you love astronomy and are a science person
18082,John  Charlesworth,he was recommended to me by my friends they were right a very interesting class and teacher many interesting and funny stories a nice guy but you have to study one of the best
18083,John  Charlesworth,i really hate his teaching style he goes on and on and explain things well plus he wrote his own textbook and you must read it because not great at teaching retire already
18084,John  Charlesworth,i dont know why people are giving such a high rating i absolutely stand his teaching i get trying to make it fun but you have to stick to reading the book a must and so is attendance quizzes are easy if you read and extra credit is easy by showing up for star gazing
18085,John  Charlesworth,so goofy so ancient i wish he were my grandpa i would know everything about the stars if he were his class is awesome he is awesome just hope you get the in college speech i love his class and fully intend to take his other one next semester the only teacher who demands a south facing classroom great
18086,John  Charlesworth,a very kind thoughtful helpful man with a passion for teaching students and astronomy you will enjoy every minute of his classes
18087,John  Charlesworth,taken two classes from him his is my alltime favorite enthusiastic helpful funny fair knowledgeable etc take him soon before he retires completely
18088,John  Charlesworth,absolutely the best extremely so lucky to have him at napa j.c.the classes are interesting and its knowledge keep and use for life
18089,John  Charlesworth,i loved charelsworth he is really funny and his topics are intresting they are easy to follow if you pay attention he had a few fun feild trips where we got to go and look at the sky and you could get extra credit just by watching a space video i loved the class plus the book is really cheap because he made it i think it was
18090,John  Charlesworth,pretty easy class if you either understand it or do some studying very helpful teacher and he makes science interesting
18091,Paula  Moore,seriously if you actually kept up with the class and did the reading assignments it was a very interestingand enjoyable class if not a slacker consider it a gpa booster
18092,Paula  Moore,as crazy as it seems she actually helped me out with the final all her crazy rambling on about all this weird stuff was exactly what i needed to know for the final i just took the final and believe i did extremely well
18093,Paula  Moore,this class was horible i hated the professor and the content of the course she is crazy whatever you do take soc with her i hear there are way better professor that teach the course i best thing was how we made fun of her shoes that she wore each day that was fun
18094,Paula  Moore,she is so crazy she will ask a question at the beginning of class then go down the roster until she finds the answer shes lookin for avoid the crazy stare and beware
18095,Paula  Moore,she is a terrible teacher she is boring and unintresting i had her as a night class it was awful try and avoid taking her
18096,Paula  Moore,you never know what this prof is up to she is nuts i hated her and her class i fought sleep till i could not take it any more and dropped the class beware of the crazy lady
18097,Paula  Moore,she is very nice and funny her class is not hard as long as you do the reading which is mostly interesting at first i did not want to take this class but soon learned that sociolgy can be fascinating
18098,Paula  Moore,one of the worst teachers ever had we had a different syllabus each week she makes no sense at all her mood for the day determined what kind of grade you got on assignments definately would not recommend
18099,Paula  Moore,wow this teacher is nuts i really dont ever pay any attention to what she is saying but i have a b in the class so i guess that makes her easy
18100,Paula  Moore,paula moore is clueless to the world but she did give us a bunch of days off so she would get good feedback from the class
18101,Paula  Moore,no comments
18102,Paula  Moore,she calls herself a feminist but just her justification for despising men had her for sociology of linguistics and she know a single thing about linguistics the worst thing is that when she know something she just makes it up the studies she had us read were bogus too
18103,Paula  Moore,this woman can not only not teach effectivly she can not clearly communicate or abstractly think her grading is unfair and her lectures disorganized sje decided days before midterm to get a book and then changed which book we needed twice
18104,Paula  Moore,no comments
18105,Paula  Moore,the class has made me miserable it has been my worst experience at eku she needs to do something about her mood swings and i am sick of watching her drool over her picks
18106,Paula  Moore,no comments
18107,Paula  Moore,this lady is a fruitcake she gave us different syllabi and you never know what she wants very unclear and her grading is completley unfair
18108,Paula  Moore,no comments
18109,Zeynep  Tenger,i did not enjoy her really bizarre book choices at all a ton of work to do for her class and way too much reading to do outside of class also if shy be weary because she really wants a lot of class participation
18110,Zeynep  Tenger,tenger is my favorite she is very accessible outside of class and genuinely wants you to succeed not just in her class but in life she is a pretty easy grader if you do what she wants she gives tons of handouts with exactly what she wants you to improve on actually a really nice person though she may seem intimidating at first
18111,Zeynep  Tenger,a lot of reading involved in this class essays are kind of long toward the end of the semester but she is willing to help would take again
18112,Zeynep  Tenger,i had dr tenger for english which focused on mental illness with three short texts and four papers none over words i found her class to be rather easy but she liked my writing style she is known for grading harshly but as long as you write basic organized essays that explain the topic well she will be generous with grading
18113,Zeynep  Tenger,she is a nice lady but her class requires a lot of work which is graded harshly i received a zero on an in class assignment that i had an excused absence for email from health center was sent to her but she wouldnt let me make it up and it hurt my grade by a letter grade
18114,Zeynep  Tenger,horrible experience i have never had a teacher who hated my work as much as dr tenger did i tried my hardest to understand what she wanted in her papers but never could prime example i went and talked to her did everything like she told me to and still got a c worth my time
18115,Zeynep  Tenger,yes
18116,Zeynep  Tenger,so nice such a fascinating class easy tests if you study and put forth an effort an english major i like lit a whole lot but she made it all very interesting finds the strangest things funny great take her for any class
18117,Zeynep  Tenger,i enjoyed dr personality i hate talking in class so i like that aspect of her classes but that is my own problem lit crit was my favorite class with her i think i really enjoyed the structure
18118,Zeynep  Tenger,she is very nice as a person and grades papers fairly but i particularly like her choice of books for us to read also just as a note most of her classes seem discussioncentered and if she suspects that the class reading start giving pop quizzes
18119,Zeynep  Tenger,really fun to listen to and a good gader very lienient
18120,Zeynep  Tenger,dr tenger is the greatest i just love her classes she is really well organized and very calm
18121,Zeynep  Tenger,while dr tenger has a great personality her class lacks structure and clarity discussion topics are not relevant to papers or tests while she is lenient she is also very unorganized
18122,Zeynep  Tenger,i love dr tenger she is so funny in class i enjoy literary criticism but she makes it as interesting as possible also a very lenient grader and this is one of the easier english courses in the major
18123,Zeynep  Tenger,dr tenger does a good job guiding class discussion and she finds strange things funny which makes class interesting who knew there was so much in the secret sharer
18124,Zeynep  Tenger,dr tenger is a great professor who is always available for help
18125,Doug  Dibble,ok he hardly shows up for class all he does it babble on about politics and hardly mentions anything that actually supposed to be talking about one day he just let everyone out about himself awkward i think he enjoyed the way too much easiest a anyone will ever get
18126,Doug  Dibble,dibble is a little weird and starts going off on tangents a lot but when it comes to getting an easy a or b you beat dibble just put your political views off to the side in his class
18127,Doug  Dibble,no comments
18128,Doug  Dibble,no comments
18129,Doug  Dibble,classes are not challenging he engage the students when he talks often onetracked and opinionated course work is dull and repetitive ideal class for slackers nothing lost but time nothing gained
18130,Doug  Dibble,hes opinionated and a bit biased but hes got a good sense of humor and is fun to talk to if he can hear you he wont bust any chops for stupidity so avoid him during the summer semester good man though and will listen its a relaxing class nice if taking units
18131,Doug  Dibble,no comments
18132,Doug  Dibble,dibble is a joke
18133,Doug  Dibble,dibble is the funniest guy i know lol its a easy a class and he makes it interesting sometimes he is hard to understand but really all you have to do is show up to get an a in his class he pisses off many people which makes class funnier lol
18134,Doug  Dibble,no comments
18135,Doug  Dibble,very easy class and prof dibble is a nice guy this specific course needed to be a little more structured he was as lost as we were
18136,Rob  Wells,one of the best professors i have ever had the best i have had at plu so far great learning experience always engaging class sessions with fun content and awesome guest speakers really helped me do well in class obviously he cares for his students even wrote a recommendation for me would highly recommend taking any of his courses
18137,Rob  Wells,i took this course last year and it changed my life because he sort of became my mentor and just one of many mentees easy to do well in his courses but seriously if you show him effort it will be the best decision you ever make fun funny chill helpful and super well connected
18138,Rob  Wells,one of the best profs at plu i graduated years ago and looking back he is still my favorite
18139,Rob  Wells,best prof ever he is awesome and he will always help you his quizzes are easy just watch the news looks like he gets his news from cnn msnbc and some local stuff he will always make class fun
18140,Rob  Wells,great teacher with interesting discussions no lecture good jterm class
18141,Rob  Wells,great prof jterm media in the world he made a hr class fun and interesting enjoyed going to class heavy use of textbook but gave us questions that would be on final day before final on top of that a really nice and cool guy
18142,Rob  Wells,best prof ever
18143,Rob  Wells,media in the world took it over jterm quite a bit of reading if you chose to read and had an assignment relative to other j term classes very easy awesome prof
18144,Rob  Wells,best professor at this school
18145,Rob  Wells,rob really cares about his students and their success he is interesting and knows what he is talking about
18146,Rob  Wells,awesome baby
18147,Rob  Wells,one of the all time best
18148,Rob  Wells,this was a great professor he was fun and always kept the class going i learned a lot from him
18149,Rob  Wells,incredible
18150,Rob  Wells,simply amazing
18151,Rob  Wells,he is such an amazing prof i schedualed my classes for next semester around him so i could take another class from him
18152,Rob  Wells,rob is a wonderful prof i was somewhat intimidated going into his class but ended up loving it i have probably learned more in his class so far than any other comm course taken he is extremely knowledgeable and approachable lots of busy work but well worth it
18153,Rob  Wells,brilliant
18154,Rob  Wells,rob is probably the best professor ever he is very laid back and his classes are so enjoyable loved every single class i have taken with him
18155,Rob  Wells,no comments
18156,Gesine  Robinson,makes it easy to understand the systems behind the grammar could do more work with vocabulary but something you can get at home has a wonderful german accent that makes her kinda hot
18157,Gesine  Robinson,good teacher i enjoyed her class and i even met my exboyfriend in that class
18158,Gesine  Robinson,a real hottie she may only be here for a few semesters languages are hard she makes it harder
18159,Raminder  Luther,she does care about her students i can give her that the only problem is she goes way too fast with lectures and a difficult time trying to understand the problems when she immediately moves on to the next how are we supposed to learn from that every other week she gives a quiz and i think we should go over the problems more before
18160,Raminder  Luther,amazing professor fin is a difficult class but she explains everything so well you barely need to go over it in the textbook she is very accessible outside of class and will see you at any time you need tests are difficult but she scales them and she gives you extra credit she takes pride when you do well in her class
18161,Raminder  Luther,professor luther is by far one of the best professors had during my tenure she will teach you the skills to not only do well in school but also excel in the industry she will meet with students on her off hours and weekends and has a great sense of pride in her accomplishments highly recommend her for this and any other courses
18162,Raminder  Luther,finance is a hard topic generally speaking but she made a lot more difficult than it needed to be in class she would teach us basics like what is and the tests and homework would be more like find the circumference of the sun and how long it would take us to get there do not take if you can get any other professor do it
18163,Raminder  Luther,was definitely a hard class but you will learn a lot she teaches at a fast pace and takes attendance every class assigns a lot of homework but check it until the end of the semester for extra credit you will need the textbook she assigns homework from it and quizzes us on chapter reading for participation points
18164,Raminder  Luther,best professor ever she genuinely cares about giving you an education instead of just helping you simply pass the class she is funny when necessary and is all around such a great human being if you respect her and listen to her lectures and do your work you will pass definitely will take this class again over
18165,Raminder  Luther,she is tough wants you to participate to help you understand finance she really cares about you learning and getting something out of class last semester she started using online resources which made some of the homework easier
18166,Raminder  Luther,professor luther is one of the best business professors salem state university if not the best she personalizes her teaching to suit each class and individually each student the information i received from professor luther is unmatched by any professor she helped me get the information i needed to get an internship and is not my advisor
18167,Raminder  Luther,she is one of those professors that expects you to fully understand a concept after one explanation of it the way she explains things is very vague and confusing she needs to find a different approach because the way she does now just cutting it please do yourself a favor and try and find a different professor
18168,Raminder  Luther,professor luther is a fantastic teacher she makes the class fun engaging and easy to understand the workload is manageable and the material is extremely relevant to the real world would definitely recommend her class if you want a solid understanding of the material
18169,Raminder  Luther,if you want to be treated as child this professor is the one for you participation is mandatory and you will be call by name and ask to go to the board and solve problems in front of the entire class it reminded me of elementary school do yourself a favor and take a class with a different professor
18170,Raminder  Luther,if you are finance student or actually interested in knowing finance i suggest you take luther although she acts as if she knows what she is talking about she talks too fast and jumps over the whole topic i barely understood anything in her class also her grading criteria is not very clear
18171,Raminder  Luther,awesome professor
18172,Raminder  Luther,awesome liked her she is nice
18173,Raminder  Luther,she is a great teacher class is hard if you put the work into it she is very fair she drops lowest grade and scales all tests must be prepared for class to earn points which account for of grade do the work and you will be fine
18174,Raminder  Luther,prof luther is an a outstanding teacher she has great skill in explaining tvm rates of return investment strategies clarified equations and workups on board with care knows her students as well warm witty practical and direct in my prep for of the most helpful professors ever you can learn so much with her
18175,Raminder  Luther,excellent professor i took on a saturday for hours each session and i always left excited to continue learning thet opics we discussed very engaging and bright not an easy class must do assigments and study
18176,Raminder  Luther,she is very difficult to understand and i think she understands the questions you ask either because she very rarely answers them correctly if you understand the subject you will be fine she scales all of the tests and drops the lowest one excluding the final very easy class but she is an irritating teacher
18177,Raminder  Luther,a good and nice teacher but this class is hard i would advise to take a small load when taking this class i would not recommend missing class because of the important material that is being taught the book was no help to me especially if stuck the teacher is helpful so ask her as many questions also form a study group its helpfu
18178,Raminder  Luther,this professor requires a lot of work compared to others who teach the same subject take a light course load if you have her for finance because it took hours to study for her test good luck
18179,Juan  Rodriguez,an expert in this subject he tailored the exercises for each student according with the native background do you know that the sh sound does not exist in spanish do you know that the sound for w was v for some students we sounds ve and i can continue on and on definitively he was an expert
18180,Juan  Rodriguez,he is very very very poor professor his pronounciation is really strange his teaching skill is not easy
18181,Juan  Rodriguez,he is really poor esl class is so worth than others if you take his class you will be regret your choose he likes only female students he never use textbooks he never hear questions he is veryveryvery
18182,Juan  Rodriguez,he tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests and what to study very nice and helpful his grading scale is very generous easy a
18183,Juan  Rodriguez,no comments
18184,Juan  Rodriguez,very clear and concise with the material also very nice and makes a lot of comical remarks on his handsome appearance in his past life
18185,Juan  Rodriguez,a very nice profesor makes a lot of jokes and tells a lot of stories if you understand the material he explains it until you understand it his test are very easy do the lab hours and homework and you will past the class
18186,Juan  Rodriguez,reading and writing forget buying the workbook but you do need the text another saving tip dont bother with the cd either overall a teacher if you dont have a thick skin pass him by he is tough but fair and you cant fail if you work
18187,Ed  Inch,i had professor inch for several classes in the late i enjoyed his sense of humor and learned a lot from him ed was also my advisor and believed in me at a time when i was young and struggling
18188,Ed  Inch,overbearingly rude and thinks cute he is very harsh and views himself as merely demanding the actual material and class is pathetically easy but he tests over inane details and is rude to any students with questions even intelligent and well thoughtout questions usually result in him announcing to the class that you have wasted his time
18189,Ed  Inch,ed is a good man but he can put people off sometimes he says or does things sometimes he uses a tone sometimes he makes people feel stupid when they necessarily deserve it if quick and mind sarcasm or if you can fire one back he can take it then you will get along with ed if not then perhaps reconsider
18190,Ed  Inch,tended to pick favorites but easy to talk to when feeling lost in the program easy to get along with eventually
18191,Ed  Inch,ichy was a great prof i still remember day one of coma123 a solid educator and a good guy heh housekeeping that word just popped back into my head maybe we can raise million and send him up to the space station so he can see that the earth is round
18192,Ed  Inch,confusing arrogant rude
18193,Ed  Inch,he treats his upper division students the way they should be treated tough but flexible and he knows what is useful and what is great hard to find him one on one since busy
18194,Ed  Inch,always willing to work with students funny if smart confusing if not
18195,Ed  Inch,no comments
18196,Ed  Inch,said all deadlines were flexible and then let us turn in a late homework assignment makes it difficult to succeed in his class
18197,Kathy  Haddad,i took photography class in she was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art i the best photographer but i did enjoy the projects and they surprisingly came out well i always admired my classmates and their creativity with her projects she was excellent thanks kathy
18198,Kathy  Haddad,she was very caring and enjoyable to be around be doing class time partially online each week through the series of videos she provides some are pretty silly for sure crack a smile each project is challenging in its own way but be wary of going too big with your ideas all very time sensitive
18199,Kathy  Haddad,throughout the class i was able to learn about different photography techniques i had no idea about important to mention haddad is a very hilarious instructor and easy to connect with
18200,Kathy  Haddad,kathy haddad is one of the best professors at chaffey college she is so sweet and truly cares for her students this class is not hard just do your weekly readings in the textbook usually about pages and take the quizzes every week two short research papers very easy and some discussion forums which were very minimal recommend
18201,Kathy  Haddad,kathy is a very laidback type of professor attendance is usually not mandatory as long as you do put in the work she does have very unorthodox approaches to assignments and projects and the medium in which she bestows it on her students however there is method to her madness and i do feel like i retain info from her classes
18202,Kathy  Haddad,one of my favorite professors i have had her for photo and and am waiting to take she is passionate about her craft talented and loves teaching she take herself too seriously and is great fun her classes are work with lots of info but she uses a variety of media to teach it quizzes can be tricky
18203,Kathy  Haddad,kathy is so much fun but if you want to do well you much keep up and do your assignments on time there is a lot of internet videos to watch many with her in them they are a crack up but you do learn a lot from them lots of work but it is always fun she is a great teacher
18204,Kathy  Haddad,amazing teacher she made me love to class and not a lot of teachers do that she makes education fun when really not and she teaches you the best way and all of the criteria unlike other lazy professors i recommend kathy but at the same time a lot of people are getting to know the best so my advice is pray get in her class
18205,Kathy  Haddad,kathy i love her so much i took photo and with her and she is such a fun enthusiasts teacher if you take her hybrid class be prepared for lots of videos and lab work outside of class really heavily focused on pushing you to your next and best level i have taken any other teacher photo she was the best ever
18206,Kathy  Haddad,kathy is an amzing professor she cares about her students but participation is a must following directions is key to this class and it is an easy a if you do what is required she gives feedback and if you follow it you will succeed i would take her class again in a minute
18207,Kathy  Haddad,kathy is awesome funny in a dorky way she makes sure you get it i learned so much from this class if you are interested in photography i highly recommend her
18208,Kathy  Haddad,awesome if you want to learn how to take awesome pictures take her she loves to help and is helpful the best professor chaffey has i would take her class again totally if you have the chance to take her and learn photography definitely recommended
18209,Kathy  Haddad,if you want to take a photo class kathy is the one to take it with she was so much fun i learned so so much from her class she makes everything easy to understand and she is very creative
18210,Kathy  Haddad,kathy is awesome she has a way of inspiring creativity and getting your mind working her instructional videos are hilarious and informative
18211,Kathy  Haddad,love kathy she is so fun to have as a professor also pays attention to each of her students which is great
18212,Kathy  Haddad,kathy was so much fun i learned so so much on her class she is helpful clear and bubbly she makes everything so easy to understand if going to take a photo class take classes looking forward to taking her photo class in the spring
18213,Kathy  Haddad,kathy is truly the best professor at chaffey hands down you will learn in her class i have become a better photographer because of her she makes you interested in the subject because she explains it crystal clear i am looking forward to taking more of her classes in january
18214,Kathy  Haddad,she is the greatest and funniest teacher at chaffey her videos are projects are easy as long as you put some effort into them make sure you silence your cell phone or else you will be bringing in a bag of cookies for the class next time
18215,Kathy  Haddad,digital photo great professor she explains everything crystal clear for you exams are easy if you do your work show up do your work and you will get a good grade
18216,Kathy  Haddad,professor haddad is a very good teacher she really gives her joy of photography to her students she always explain her assignments well but she is very helpful when you email her or ask questions
18217,David  Hyde,best lecturer i have ever had very interesting and you have to show up everyday if you want to would recommend showing up
18218,David  Hyde,i took social problems as well as criminology and i thoroughly enjoyed both classes david is a very straightforward getstraighttothepoint professor so class definitely got depressing sometimes he does not sugarcoat anything which i believe helps us learn concepts better overall i would highly recommend taking his classes
18219,David  Hyde,hyde is a really cool guy and always has interesting stories to share he is super smart and intellectual to the point where kind of intimidating some of the time when people raised their hands he would kind of shut down their ideas but for the most part he is really nice super easy homework he takes attendance once a week
18220,David  Hyde,one my favorite professors so far very lecture heavy but his lectures are always interesting and he throws in some personal stories as well only assigns one assignment a week but quick and easy and the final is open book
18221,David  Hyde,probably the best professor had he really cares about his students and really prides in his lectures in addition his lectures are all available online just for anyone to use the assignments he gave were easy all you really need to do is attend his classes and all set plus his stories are great his final was easy take it
18222,David  Hyde,great professor and has interesting lectures although he lacks group projects and even though his lectures are interesting if you love listening to lectures they can get kinda boring tip for the test go to his lecture notes on canvas and hit on your keyboard an open test so you can do word search on notes to get the answers
18223,David  Hyde,professor hyde is awesome i learned so much from his criminology class there was barely any homework and the tests were really easy if you paid attention and took notes in class he lectured most of the time but he was not boring about it he told a few personal stories i would recommend for any class
18224,David  Hyde,lectures can get a bit boring but he adds in really amusing stories about his life to help lighten things up minimal homework super short easy essays due every week on canvas and a final exam lots of extra credit opportunities
18225,David  Hyde,one of the best teachers had ever he tells great stories the whole course is basically lecture we have one final exam we have weekly assignments that are really easy loved the subject material he knows what talking about loved his lectures wished it was a bit more interactive would take him again if i could
18226,David  Hyde,a really nice teacher he really cares about the students
18227,David  Hyde,i loved this class he teaches from a sociology perspective and you learn so much quirky blunt sense of humor and tells the wildest stories one assignment per week with a final at the end of the course show up to class and do the weekly assignment the classroom dynamic is lowkey and comfortable super cool guy highly recommend him
18228,David  Hyde,i took global sociology class because my previously selected class was canceled he even wrote the textbook for the class plus free file he gives out for download i had him for criminology a few quarters ago too and it was very interesting some very crazy stories from his life and a very friendly guy overall
18229,David  Hyde,david is a good teacher he knows how to make the subject sound interesting no matter what it is he also has really good stories to tell if you have an opportunity to take a class with him do it you regret it the only homework he assigns is reading chapters a week and a weekly online discussion the final was open book open note
18230,David  Hyde,loved him he rocks so nice kind of awkward but the best type of awkward saw him downtown oly so cool he is opinionated but force his ideas on you i liked him
18231,David  Hyde,this guy likes to get deep tests are open note sometimes open book so it is super important to take notes if you miss a day you can always get the notes off of his power points or from a fellow student make sure you do all of the assignments on time that is where most of the grade is
18232,David  Hyde,hyde is by far the best professor had at spscc his criminology class was extremely interesting and i learned a lot from him the lectures could sometimes be dull but he would tend to tell personal stories to liven things up the homework load was minimal and we hardly ever used the book in class you need to take a class with hyde
18233,David  Hyde,genius sorry david is a hottie to bad i will never have a class with him again
18234,David  Hyde,this is my second quarter with hyde his class is easy but heavy on lectures there are no tests and the only assignments are weekly discussion posts and a final paper its pretty easy and an interesting class
18235,David  Hyde,hyde is probably my favorite professor at spscc interesting engaging and knows what the hell talking about his stories spice up his lectures and the information he shares is really interesting i learned more in the classes i took with hyde than in any other classes and it was incredibly easy if on the fence do it
18236,David  Hyde,i am obsessed with david hyde i am majoring in sociology and have taken every class he has at sps he should be teaching at the university level because he is a walking talking genius if you print out the pp notes at the start of class and follow along with lectures taking notes on you go wrong every day is interesting
18237,Craig  Hickman,easy grader very knowledgeable and easygoing he really just cares if you are present during mine was an advanced class always seems happy to be there and enthusiastic about digital art
18238,Craig  Hickman,very nice sometimes maybe too nice not assertive at all which can be frustrating
18239,Craig  Hickman,not only is craig one of the most experienced and passionate professors taken a course from but he is just a really really nice guy he is very laid back about grading which allowed me to explore the course material much more thoroughly craig is one of those professors who just loves what he does and as a result is rather brilliant
18240,Craig  Hickman,craig loves photography and loves to teach it he gives out weekly assignments but typically easy always a joy in class and teaches tips and tricks in photoshop that most people know been using photoshop since version take digital imaging from him much more experienced than others teaching it
18241,Craig  Hickman,excellent teacher photographer and software author
18242,Craig  Hickman,brilliant computer dork makes good art
18243,Jason  Sloan,jason is the best seriously value every second you have with him hes wonderful
18244,Jason  Sloan,i took emac class years ago jason maintains that perfect balance of friend and professor he knows how to earn respect from his students as well as give respect to his students i learned a ton from jason and his class really broadened my horizons as an artist and did so in a very encouraging way jason is an absolute asset to mica imo
18245,Jason  Sloan,had him for emac my freshman year of art college great teacher super helpful and knowledgable of what teaching class has a lot of freedom but also just enough structure great lecturer as well highly recommend jason
18246,Jason  Sloan,prior to this class i even know what the adobe cloud was i was nervous that because jason taught the advanced emac class i would really struggle but we went through each program from the ground up and our projects were left relatively open jason is really helpful and willing to make time out of class to help as well
18247,Jason  Sloan,i knew very little about sound art before this class this class was awesome very hands on the classes are jam packed with workshops demos visiting artists performances etc fun class
18248,Jason  Sloan,had jason for sound art jason is very helpful and enthusiastic good teacher but the class utterly favors electronics and jason seems to believe that if its not avant garde its weaker its a bit like going to a music school and taking an art class to find that the prof is a virtuouso in photoshop who thinks painting is passe
18249,Jason  Sloan,jason is the best professor ever loves subject he teaches.very intelligent and prepared to absolutely if he know atm find it out for helped out a lot with choosing ixda as my major.he cares a lot about his subject and the excited for sound art with him
18250,Jason  Sloan,had ixda seminar with jason and he is a great professor and cares a lot about his students very techy guy nerds out often in a good way we took a lot of field trips had many guest allowed us to see a variety of future paths in the ixda field mad into sound so take is classes
18251,Jason  Sloan,so great jason is an amazing lecturer and makes himself available definitely is an inspiring teacher
18252,Jason  Sloan,jason has inspired me more than any other teacher ever had a delightfully funny guy but more importantly he loves what teaching influenced me to realize that i am indeed an interactive media major thank you jason
18253,Jason  Sloan,jason is a great teacher always is getting you to push what you are doing at the moment
18254,Jason  Sloan,a great teacher and has become an important part of the interactive media department he knows how to motivate students and get them to look inward at themselves and question why they make art i never really thought much about concept or history before i had him really helped me to focus my voice if you taken him yet do it
18255,Jason  Sloan,awesome teacher knows a lot of stuff and is into cool had him before and now i have him again sweet
18256,Jason  Sloan,great teacher very technical course for the first half but we got to do some really cool things after we got the basics under our belt he put a lot of information into the class but stuff i have not gotten from my other teachers we did html css xml dreamweaver flash action scripting php video and sound lots of new media art too
18257,Jason  Sloan,class is kind of hard but professor sloan is the best i never thought i would ever get html or any kind of coding or techie software before this class learning alot very quickly he knows quite a bit about everything recommend taking him if you take this class i heard he is the best emac teacher too
18258,Jason  Sloan,great teacher and the best looking one at mica
18259,Jason  Sloan,awesomeness jason is amazing and very very nice guy and very intelligent he made what could have been a difficult class fun
18260,Jason  Sloan,great teacher great class pretty interesting stuff very knowledgeable about the subject matter and i learned a lot good stuff here
18261,Jason  Sloan,great teacher dude knows a lot of stuff very technical course but he makes it interesting looking forward to later in the semester when we can be a bit more creative very helpful i was not getting a lot of the html stuff and he came in late on a friday afternoon to spend an hour and a half to help and i finally got it not too many teache
18262,Jason  Sloan,awesome teacher and is fun knows his stuff lots of work though
18263,Malcolm  Potter,professor potter is the best sociology instructor he genuinely cares if understanding the material and is more than willing to help lectures were quick and informative his oneline jokes are an added bonus definitely take professor potter if you have the chance
18264,Malcolm  Potter,he is the best professor ever he is by far the best sociology professor love him he is very flexible with his schedule he always asks students if they need help with their essay questions
18265,Malcolm  Potter,love this guy great professor to take for sociology the winter course is very condensed though making studying for tests hard wish i had taken him during a full semester lectures were great you can record too and he is very nice about getting you a free online book so that you can use it for the course also hump days on wednesdays
18266,Malcolm  Potter,pretty easy doesnt post grades at all though he doesnt believe in using much technology no homework really except studying and the workbooks which he helps out with
18267,Malcolm  Potter,this class was really easy potter is an easy teacher and there was hardly any work for the class the only downside is you see your grade because he use canvas but you can always ask for it
18268,Malcolm  Potter,his grading is based on attendance oral presentation midterm with essay and final essay prompts are given week in advance to prepare for the oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading its really easy
18269,Malcolm  Potter,professor potter is a really good and caring professor he goes through his lectures at a good pace to make sure you get what you need the only downside is that your graded on few things but as long as you study hard its a great class to take
18270,Malcolm  Potter,voice and great enunciation lectures at a good rate not too fast not too slow willing to always repeat himself to make sure you get the notes down very caring and approachable gives study guides and preps you well for the exams lectures are precise but better to read the book too when studying for tests best teacher ever
18271,Malcolm  Potter,honestly the best teacher out there i am so glad i took him his grading is pretty easy as well he does try to help his students out by giving a practice test before the actual test hes a very understanding and wonderful teacher
18272,Malcolm  Potter,his grading is based on attendance oral presentation midterm with essay and final essay prompts are given week in advance to prepare for the oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading its really easy go to his class his exams are based on lectures
18273,Malcolm  Potter,lectures can seem a bit out of date and somewhat boring but he cares about his students and he really tries to make it easy for everyone class attendance and the oral presentation are gifts from him to you easiest of the grade just show up goes over everything that will be in exams class paper is easy just follow the outline no hmwrk
18274,Malcolm  Potter,took him in the summer and he was absolutely phenomenal his grades are based on attendance oral presentation midterm essay and final essay prompts are given week in advance to prepare for go to class his exams are based on lectures the book is helpful not necessary loved his laugh and his personality
18275,Malcolm  Potter,a really good teacher tests are just the midterm and final he gives you study guide and practice with the class before the test and there is an essay question for the test he gives you the prompt so you can be prepared individual presentation is he just gives you a question and you have to find it in the book and present it in class
18276,Malcolm  Potter,i learned so much in this class potter is a very clear professor and is always there for students i stress how much information i retained after taking this class i highly recommend taking this class
18277,Malcolm  Potter,professor potter is the best instructor had he makes every class fun and really knows what talking about make sure you read the book to pass the midtermfinal even though he gives you a study guide highly recommend this class enjoy
18278,Malcolm  Potter,mr potter is a great teacher even though that not easy he only does midterm and finals he also does class paper attendance and chapter presentations

18280,Malcolm  Potter,pay attention in class take notes study the notes and you will do fine

18282,Malcolm  Potter,great class very nice lovable guy with a booming voice like james earl makes the subject very fun a very helpful to his students must take
18283,Maryam  Vulis,very nice teacher good on grading but hard to understand hand her handwriting also hard to understand her accent she is all over the place can be very confusing
18284,Maryam  Vulis,she teach and she speak english her tests are very difficult i fix computers for a living and her tests are even hard for me i think she is russian qcc should hire translator for her lol she is really a math professor and teach computer scince i feel sorry for her math students too.i am thinking of dropping her class.word
18285,Maryam  Vulis,this professor needs to learn how to speak english lol you will have tough time understanding her she is also evil.she said she will send students to the dean for talking if it is about classwork.makes students use teach comp science i can feel sorry for her math students classisnothard she is
18286,Maryam  Vulis,this class is not meant for the century i feel like i already know more about computers than this professor does she doe not speak english well and is mad boring the class is a joke one of her classes got cancelled because noone wants to register for her class she does not seem like a computer expert extremelly boring
18287,Maryam  Vulis,absolutely dread this class the most appealing topic but it gets really bad when the professor is terrible really nice and all but very very boring she has no control over her class hopefully only like this with this class but judging from the other comments made by other students unfortunately not
18288,Maryam  Vulis,hated her at first i thought she won the teachers lotto and thats why she was allowed to teach she is a sweetheart and will go out of her way to help you just be patient
18289,Maryam  Vulis,telling you guys so easy and helpful a little bit confusing but just stick to the review test and then it
18290,Maryam  Vulis,shes a very nice teacher even though i hear alot of complaints from the class its onli becuz they are not payin attention at all but yet they expect the teacher to bend over backwards to teach when most of the class doesnt even pay attention definitely good teacher
18291,Maryam  Vulis,many students say this teacher is bad but if students would just pay attention and do their work they would find that this teacher is very helpful and very nice if you do your work in this class you will get an a
18292,Maryam  Vulis,she is the worse professor ever you cant understnd what she says and she jumps from on thing to another she confuses her self and her students
18293,Maryam  Vulis,terrible teach very confusing i dropped her class
18294,Maryam  Vulis,holy crap can q.c.c please hire a translator she teach but is still an easy a

18299,Norma  Manatu,this professor was amazing i enjoyed every minute and she is soo good at teaching if anyone needs to com class take her
18300,Norma  Manatu,i had her in she is a kind person who cares about her students i learned a lot in her class i do all the work necessary and so received the grade i deserved.she was very fair and even gave me chances to make it up but i was taking classes and working full time so i bother a really good teacher i liked her a lot
18301,Norma  Manatu,best professor ever had learned so much in her class not an easy grade but what she teaches will get you in all other classes so much more than a speech class highly recommended
18302,Norma  Manatu,i expected to give some speeches pass the class and move on but ms manatu made this class into a true learning experience she wants you to participate and engage in the class which by was hard to do but worth the effort she lays out everything you need to do in your speeches with detailed outlines loved this class
18303,Norma  Manatu,the perfect speech professor
18304,Norma  Manatu,she is good at her job she can sometimes rant but she knows her work people who thinks she nuts really want to be in her class just listen and do the work you will be fine
18305,Norma  Manatu,she is great she makes you personally responsible she tells you how life really is she does not tolerate immaturity ghetto bs goofing off she worked very hard to get her phd she expects you to work hard in her class and in life you may hate speech but you will come out of her class one step closer to being a real woman or man
18306,Norma  Manatu,i love this honestly wish i can take her again.she is amazingly insightful knowledgeable about her work and has a passion to teach.she is no nonsense however and you must respect her class or she will set you what i loved about her the learned so much in and will view films differently from now on
18307,Norma  Manatu,amazing very easy class i was scared to take this class cuz i hate talking in front of ppl but i got a with almost no effort and late speech fair and helpful explains the material over and over again
18308,Norma  Manatu,this professor was absent many times we had to rush with everything we learned thus it was harder to comprehend she walks into the room without acknowleding the class i find that really rude personally i really did not like her and she made me hate speech class.she would have these outburst it made me very uncomfortable
18309,Norma  Manatu,you will never forget her as your profeesor
18310,Norma  Manatu,two words drag queen she always sits there sucking on her teeth and sighing throughout the entire speech she is a mess in a designer dress despite shoddy attempts at professionalism and is always complaining about her medication she is an attendance hound but missed days herself last semester avoid at all cost
18311,Norma  Manatu,she was an ok professor i felt as though she was just a little to harsh she needs to consider speaking tok some people in private about matters rthat can be dealt with in private otherwise she wasnt bad at all i learned alot and had a few laughs shes a diva in every respect of the word
18312,Norma  Manatu,you will learn a lot and see life through a different perspective it is an interesting class but it does require an open mind and maturity so red or green pill
18313,Norma  Manatu,manatu is not easy but she is fair she cares about her students and she is good i cannot understand how anyone could find this woman boring her outbursts in class have cracked me up more than once she can be harsh sometimes but because she has a low tolerance for do the work be respectful and try hard
18314,Norma  Manatu,no comments
18315,Norma  Manatu,this profeesor is very nice she helped me alot to look at life in a different way some people think she is harsh but is better that way cause life is not easy and if you are hungry for success she is a great help to achieve all your goals she made me realize the best thing in life is when your work for what you want
18316,Norma  Manatu,learned alot in her class when she said what you learn in speech class will help later in life ie jobrelated and just plain communicating with people she meant it didnt care for public speaking before her class now i wonder what the fuss was about she made it simple great teacher but tough condescending at times but means well
18317,Norma  Manatu,yeah i agree with what the previous student posted on manatu you do not want to get on her bad side do all speeches required for the semester mini intro informative persuasive speeches ace the midterm final be alright oh yeah do give her feedback because she expects it go nuts if no one respond back with feedback
18318,Norma  Manatu,great prof really knows what she is doing teaches well if you do the work and mess around however watch out her bad side is not cool gets sidetracked at times but her way of looking at life is interesting and very funny she assign that much work so just do it when you get it and read the txt bk
18319,John  Kneski,one of the best classes i ever had at fiu even though t was saturday mornings very cool professor and a very cool class
18320,John  Kneski,one of the best teachers at fiu
18321,John  Kneski,prof kneski is what study abroad should be all about he has little patience for children but all the time in the world for those that are serious best teacher i ever had at fiu
18322,John  Kneski,great teacher challenging class he is always available outside of class for help we actually published a book in this class what a great project if lazy this is not a good class for you
18323,John  Kneski,expect to do a lot of work some of his assignments are pointless they can also be difficult and time consuming but an easy grader the class is pretty boring
18324,John  Kneski,great professor eager to teach and for his students to learn take him if just into getting an easy grade expect to read a lot and work hard as well overall his class was interesting besides being a great professor also a great person as well
18325,John  Kneski,i personally like him he is not clear with the assignments he wants he give you the grades of the assignments you turn in until the end of the semester that you receive your final grade never try to reach him by email he never answers or ask him anything after class instead he wants you to go to his office
18326,John  Kneski,by far one of the more interesting and intelligent professors i have ever had he is passionate about teaching and his energy is contageous would take any class he offers great as a teacher and great to just talk to about anything highly recommend
18327,John  Kneski,very cool and understanding would recommend him anytime also quite a hottie
18328,John  Kneski,no comments
18329,John  Kneski,he is the hottest professor in the school
18330,John  Kneski,what kind of promises would a professor make to a student weird this guy is the best teacher i ever had
18331,John  Kneski,good teacher nice guy once you get to know him needs to work on the whole keeping promises to students thing though
18332,John  Kneski,perpetual bad mood and keep his promises when it comes to giving students squab but a pretty cool guy sometimes anyway
18333,Maureen  O\'Connor,this was a grad course on how to teach psych to undergrads i learned so much about what not to do she was disorganized distracted very unclear she able to finish grading on time due to dealing with administrative issues so she decided it would be okay to give the entire class incompletes weeks later still no grades seriously
18334,Maureen  O\'Connor,she is an amazing professor who dedicates her time to teaching and getting to know her students the level of work is appropriate for college meaning there is a lot of reading and your brain will be put to work she inspires you to learn and writes amazing recommendation letters she has a solid background in law and psychology
18335,Maureen  O\'Connor,the best
18336,Maureen  O\'Connor,really good hard but worth it i learned a lot if you want an easy a dont take this but then you shldnt be in college if you dont want to learn
18337,Barbara  Odabashian,she is too narrowminded to entertain comments too lazy to teach a course with professional lectures and gets away sitting on her behind for hours every class day watching the same movies my final paper was more than exemplary and she see past her ignorance to appreciate its awesomeness
18338,Barbara  Odabashian,she took an interesting concept and presented it horribly i know why she include of the spielberg classics empire of the sun maybe not that familiar with the subject very rude to the students she has no people skills whatsoever maybe openly sadistic i know what her problem is but this class was hell
18339,Barbara  Odabashian,hard grader but i just took her for nyc film so it that bad watch movies every week and only had to write papers all semester
18340,Barbara  Odabashian,she is never satisfied with anything she wants the in class essays to be perfect if she wants it to perfect might as well give them in home essays since i started this class i been getting c i answered the questions but it good enough for her i was taking this for my minor but she is going to ruin my gpa she is sucks take her u w
18341,Barbara  Odabashian,okay prof i really didnt like her too much she loves to hear herself talk and take into consideration others ideas and point of views she wants you to notice what she notices basically nothing is open to interpretation and the whole point of taking a film class in class exams and a paper not bad want an a good luck
18342,Barbara  Odabashian,if you want to get an a in this class you have to really analyze the films take a lot of notes and participate i got an a by working my ass off two in class essays and one final paper the films are pretty good too
18343,Barbara  Odabashian,she is a hard grader but you will most likely get a b not below so if you are border line and really want to stress out with hard reading and writing take her class for that english honors minor nonetheless if you want to do really well just focus on writing about what she is asking you and do not summarize the movie i am serious
18344,Barbara  Odabashian,she is a hard grader always had high grade in writting until her class but if you want to graduate with an english honors minor all you need to do is take film classes she gave me a b she gives essays and you basically just sit back and whatch movies
18345,Barbara  Odabashian,the films are okay her writing is hard to rd and shes weird about how she grades
18346,Barbara  Odabashian,hard grader for no obvious reason missed one class and did all the papers which i thought were good with good she ended up giving me a there was no clear way to get an a and she ruined my gpa if you care about having a super high gpa fine but if trying to maintain a high one bother
18347,Barbara  Odabashian,the professor was excellect and insighful she knows her stuff i was happy with my
18348,Barbara  Odabashian,odabashian gave me a b she sucks
18349,Barbara  Odabashian,i got an a i took her twice
18350,Barbara  Odabashian,you could give the best examples of film interpretation in this class and you grade may hinge above a b if a genius although the class is easy and there are essays aim for a b to because n one gets higher than that
18351,Barbara  Odabashian,beware you get higher than a b
18352,Barbara  Odabashian,she was obviously a film major and gives great insight into the films as well as surrounding political events at the time the film was
18353,Barbara  Odabashian,there is no required text weekly movies with no homework it get easier than this
18354,Barbara  Odabashian,i enjoyed the class and the professor is very nice class meets only once a week and she assigns only three essays
18355,Steven  Penrod,a very easy grader but this an easy a the classes are a bit tedious and repetitive and if you have a solid background in statistics the readings can be confusing
18356,Steven  Penrod,this is a man of striking brilliance if you are looking for an intellectual challenge definitely take his class course requirements are pretty easy there was no final exam just writing comments on assigned readings all on his website and a paper
18357,Steven  Penrod,a god among men
18358,Erica  Abeel,i took her class in or just because she was so hot back then she had a great attitude and was great to look at
18359,Erica  Abeel,the worst french teacher ever my wife who is a native french national laughed everyday because i was literally being tought nothing i learned more at home i paid for this class aviod this one guys let the other posts fool you its confusing and ridiculous not easy either
18360,Erica  Abeel,please you dont need to study for that class you come sit get an a your brain is not worked at all if looking just to get an a in foreign language requirements take fre and with her easy a
18361,Erica  Abeel,in the beginning of the course find her difficult but when u r wrong of great help u have just final and some quizzes she gives homeworks but they are damn easy and short she was great and i took her back to back for take her for an easy a
18362,Erica  Abeel,good professor
18363,Erica  Abeel,i think she is a good professor just more board work is needed
18364,Erica  Abeel,shes getting paid for this better yet you want me to pay for this
18365,Erica  Abeel,while passing the class with an a is pretty simple as long as you pass all the simple requirments its pretty much a fend for yourself atmotsphere if your really in the class to learn the prof picks favorites and notsofavorites but she shows movies and the homeworks a cinch
18366,Erica  Abeel,even though she gave me an a i cannot in good conscience give her a good review she is a horrible teacher even though i have a great grade i have learned next to nothing i just hope i will be prepared for fre
18367,Erica  Abeel,take her if you want an easy a and have to take a language course however if you are interested in learning french truley still take her because you want an easy a anyway you can get it right but seriously if you want to learn french in her class you must really practice and persue it on your own because she is just a little too light for a true
18368,Erica  Abeel,nice and understanding if you are sick tell her before class duh if a medical condition she will understand also i had a b in her class and learned but if you practice on your own forget about learning french practice is the fun part oui
18369,Erica  Abeel,take her if you want an easy a she is soo easy
18370,Erica  Abeel,i liked this professor i thought she was fair helpful and mad class fun most of the stuff she did was jus show us alot of french movies which taught me the language better lol not but i did catch up on some sleep but review the movies because it will be on her exams
18371,Erica  Abeel,no comments
18372,Erica  Abeel,she has stinking attidude.she grades based on how she likes the if u know some french automatically you will pass with an a.she insists on she catches an attitude if u want to be very clear on a topic.take prof.alexandre for french
18373,Erica  Abeel,if you are french or know french she will give you a good grade if you are trying to learn french take her because she will not teach you a thing do not come to class sick she will discriminate against you.i think her attitude stinks and there have been many complaints against her

18377,Valerie  Allen,a pleasure to have this professor very precise helpful and a great sense of humor would take her again
18378,Valerie  Allen,like most people said yes she is tough grader but not impossible to get an a i love her class becasue she is so considerate professor show her that you try and you do your best then you will be fine with her
18379,Valerie  Allen,a gpa killer in isp you should try to avoid her
18380,Valerie  Allen,she is a bitter professor not happy with anything you do but does not give you enough help to do good
18381,Valerie  Allen,she keeps class fun and interesting and thats not easy to do with any lit class plus i was one of the clowns that was always being stupid in the back of the classroom and she would let us get away with it as long as we were joking about the reading and the sshhing girl in the back u would understand if u took the class
18382,Valerie  Allen,love the accent hard readings that you must do to be pepared everyday for a quiz
18383,Valerie  Allen,very vague and not specific as to what requirements are in regards to assignements
18384,Valerie  Allen,if every professor was like dr allen we all would be inspired she is absolutely great
18385,Valerie  Allen,very good professor pretty tough on writing errors but she helped me when i got behind in the work due to personal issues very kind good and sweet person
18386,Valerie  Allen,awesome professor great teaching style i took this class on line and its a lot of work but she makes it fun she knows her stuff
18387,Valerie  Allen,she is understanding and interesting just pay attention to her she knows her stuff
18388,Valerie  Allen,i took the online course lots of essays or answering questions but not a difficult course professor is understanding helpful and she gives credit for whatever work you submit read the material participate and do fine in the class
18389,Valerie  Allen,she is very helpful pay attention to deadlines and participate and have no problems
18390,Valerie  Allen,she offers a great lit class online shes very fiar and pay attention to everything you write without improper judgement
18391,Valerie  Allen,you will like the class if you love to read and write she is a very nice and fair teacher
18392,Charles  Bahn,wonderful professor taught me everything i needed to know to work as a forensic psychologist in a prison he knows his material from working in the real world a wonderful change from boring professors that only teach theory and of the best if not the best professors i ever had
18393,Charles  Bahn,he is a kind old fellow but sometimes gets lost in mid thought he goes off on more tangents than my grandma with alzhiemers but many of his tangentsa are interesting an informative he trys hard to get students to think independently and i like that although he is a pessimist at heart i thought he robbed me on my grade but he did not agre
18394,Charles  Bahn,the real deal he occasionally misses class because he has been flown to dangerour wartorn parts of the world where his expertise is required he once had to leave early to catch a flight but was enjoying the class discussion when a student reminded him he had a flight to catch he said ok a military flight wait
18395,Michael  Blitz,a tough grader will call on everyone for answers and expects you to act and think scholarly wrong with that though in college and that too a senior college and not community college if you handle basic studying then real got surprises for you be ready to work but also be ready to learn
18396,Michael  Blitz,youre going to read a lot he is not easy he also doesnt tolerate slackers in other words the real deal for a professor i pay for a dumbed down education blitz takes students seriously and demands a lot and what you should want only been weeks and this is already my favorite class then again here to learn
18397,Michael  Blitz,get ready to read alot we basically read articles that were pointless throughout the semester and got quizzed on them blitz is also a confusing guy he may seem like an intelligent guy but he often goes too far with the point making and totally loses you avoid if possible
18398,Michael  Blitz,a freshman second semester my friend was signed up for blitz class and convinced me to take it with her i am very glad i did prof blitz class is fun but also serious about the idea of worlds he can be funny but also makes you think totally new thoughts about everything he has a nice coteacher who has her own style which is very nice
18399,Michael  Blitz,professor bltiz is a great professor he really makes class interesting and great he does have quizzes which i found kind of ridiculous as they were a bit tough but make sure you do all his readings and homework and you will pass the class and his quizes also participate and actually try its all worth it
18400,Michael  Blitz,a good teacher he really cares about everyone teaching and gives over some valuable life skills and tips also very interesting teacher funny
18401,Michael  Blitz,he could be a little tough but if you pay attention to what is being taught and make the effort to correct your errors it will definitely boost your grade and get a higher grade in class
18402,Michael  Blitz,expect a lot of work very confusing and hard for no reason the class was long and boring and i learn anything avoid
18403,Michael  Blitz,has a good rep and right he is amazing told us first day that he bore us but not allowed to bore him better do your work tho great prof
18404,Michael  Blitz,i had professor b for classes and now a obviously i think he is a great teacher if you do the reading and writings on time and participate you can do well a lotta reviews say he is scary which i totally get but mainly because he wants you to work hard he also does not tolerate foolishness
18405,Michael  Blitz,week of class love it love it love it professor blitz has a reputation that very demanding and scary maybe how it will be but after two doubleperiod classes already my favorite professor out of previous semesters
18406,Michael  Blitz,i loved professor blitz i took a class with him and professor sarna and it was amazing granted a lot of work so expect that but he makes the content fun and is able to relate to the students great professor and if an isp class you need a textbook
18407,Michael  Blitz,he made us think about multiple futures he made everyone give mini lectures in the semester i still believe he connected microscopes to time machines to multiple infinities and lose me hardest class ever best class ever wish i could take him every semester
18408,Michael  Blitz,hard class if you want to pass gotta do all the work
18409,Michael  Blitz,my tips for anyone taking a class with blitz do not come to class unprepared participate enjoy yourself he is awesome a little scary sometimes but he really wants his students to do well
18410,Michael  Blitz,teaches with sarna both are great blitz can be hilarious but is also very serious about students doing their work he seems to know a lot about a lot of things never boring tough grader not tolerant of laziness at all probably best teacher had at jj
18411,Michael  Blitz,intelligent but also challenging he as difficult as i thought but you definitely need work hard
18412,Michael  Blitz,professor blitz and sarna were both great teachers they give any tests however they do give a few pop quizzes and some are scheduled on the syllabus no textbook use but you will be reading several books i would have to say that professor blitz was a difficult class to pass but well worth the challenge improved my writing tenfold
18413,Michael  Blitz,realize how famous he was until i came here lol on that note yes tough fair but intimidating will make you work for that grade prof sarna is gr8 as well you will not succeed if excessively i hated participating and he picked up on it so he would make me do it but all to make you better as a student
18414,Michael  Blitz,on the first day i was warned by other students.but i find him to be brilliant thoughtprovoking funny and very engaging people in my classes love him i hate participating but he challenged me in a great way been taking his courses ever since please slam the door be conscious he is great period
18415,David  Brant,horrible professor unorganized and thinks he knows everything he is very boring and is not a fair grader the final and final paper are on the same day i beg anyone who even thinks of taking him to think again and run if you have to stay at john jay an extra semester just so you have to take him it is worth it take him
18416,David  Brant,keep away this man is boring miserable and sucks at grading he weill lose your work and hand it back until it is too late to drop the course i almost left john jay because of him if i had to i would skip a semester just so i have to take him again poor excuse for a professor or therapist
18417,David  Brant,no comments
18418,David  Brant,very boring and is ridiculous in grading papers basically if you want an a on a paper you have to dumb down your writing if you write a paper that sounds like it came out of a real psychology journal ie a good paper then he like it the text is written by him and seems to be written for a grader
18419,David  Brant,one of the worse professors ever had just a short man with a personality to match god help anyone who has him as a teacher or therapist
18420,David  Brant,he is a little boring teaches straight from his textbook only paper midterm and final just show up and pay attention and fine
18421,David  Brant,i had him for an internship advisor he made me not want to do anything in psychology he shoots down your dreams
18422,David  Brant,i needed two hits of expresso in order to stay awake his tests are extremely hard and the third test and final are on the same date half of my class failed him i was one of the few lucky ones just because i can write good papers he is brilliant psychologist but he should not be teaching
18423,David  Brant,do not take this class if you want to keep your sanity he is extremely hard on tests on the day of the final you have your exam plus cumulitive final which encompasses roughly chapters stay away
18424,David  Brant,boring if you dont fall asleep in this class you might catch him falling asleep himself he makes no sense is all over the place and its painful to make it thru the hours so far the test was ok if you read the page research articles
18425,Lowry  Marshal,lowry is a great acting teacher be afraid of her she has great things to share imagine theatre program without lowry it would be pretty weak tons of experience and insight and has always been warm and approachable
18426,Lowry  Marshal,i studied with lowery over years ago she is with out question the worst acting teacher i have had the misfortune of working with it took me years to get over her petty favoritism and her constant over selling
18427,Lowry  Marshal,so sick of her dog by now
18428,Lowry  Marshal,i have found lowry to be among the most judgemental difficult uncaring professors i have ever had to those she preselects as her favorites she is very kind if not on her a list watch out
18429,Lowry  Marshal,no comments
18430,Lowry  Marshal,no comments
18431,David  Brotherton,he is a great prof at john jay college i took his soc343 class take home midterm and open book final a short proposal paper a research paper long that was all he showed us a lot of great documentaries most of class time and he really cares about his students take him
18432,David  Brotherton,great professor open book midterm page paper and open book final
18433,David  Brotherton,professor brotheron is a very cool professor he does not expect much of u the midterms are open book the final is a take home.he gives page term paper thats due at the end of the semester overall he is very funny and he makes u want to come to class
18434,David  Brotherton,no comments
18435,David  Brotherton,he has a hot british accent that makes you want to listen to anything he says he is quite droolworthy
18436,David  Brotherton,no comments
18437,Leslie  Chadrakantha,horrible he just reads off the slides and talks to the board he has a thick accent so you can barely understand him
18438,Leslie  Chadrakantha,i am the worst student in the world when it comes to math but he really keeps it simple he gives plenty of examples in class and helps you understand the material the class is hard to begin with but i can finally say this is one math class i passed he has an accent but not hard to understand him tip do the homework it helps
18439,Leslie  Chadrakantha,not a bad teacher just a tough subject although he can be hard to understand sometimes you have to pay attention because he does not really review past lectures if you miss classes chances are you wont do so well on the tests
18440,Leslie  Chadrakantha,obviously he knows the material however does not have a clue on how to teach it he is very confusing he does not go over enough examples in class he just likes to hear himself talk and recite his own notes which he has memorized.math is all about stimulation and practice and he provides zero of any of that overall he is terrible at teaching
18441,Leslie  Chadrakantha,only take him if you are already interested in math otherwise he will be hard to understand both because he is dull and has a thick accent he reads off of the slides a lot and makes no effort to make it interesting if you struggle with the subject
18442,Leslie  Chadrakantha,lesli is a wonderful professor no math subject is easy you always have to do a lot of work i extremely recommend him
18443,Leslie  Chadrakantha,all his class is a review from the textbook
18444,Leslie  Chadrakantha,this guy is a joke do not take this class if you want a passing grade he is a good person horrible teacher
18445,Leslie  Chadrakantha,great really lays the material out in a comprehensible fashion if you have a problem he always stops what he is doing to answer your question and makes sure you understand before continuing
18446,Leslie  Chadrakantha,great professor could be the first math professor met with a sense of humor he is a very fair grader and clarifies the material well
18447,Leslie  Chadrakantha,great prof gives very clear explanations your present mind is required in class if you want to get a good do not know why other rewievs blame him because he is extremely helpful and precize if you still did not get it blame yourself
18448,Leslie  Chadrakantha,woow idk who are rating this prof might be students who wants to do nothing in college and get an a so sad hes a great proffesor if u dont understand something he will explain it to u again i learn so much and teaches great take him took him in a winter course and got an a
18449,Leslie  Chadrakantha,okay
18450,Leslie  Chadrakantha,very great and helpful professor take him for the summer knows his work and has excellent teaching skills goes over work until you understand it gives to hw assignments per wk problems total drops and is of your grade an easy gives exams dropping the lowest come to class do your hw will do great take him
18451,Leslie  Chadrakantha,best professor in john jay to teach math he mad the class so easy and amazing gives hwk once a week and dropest the lowest test grade amazing
18452,Leslie  Chadrakantha,this professor is soo hard to understand every class i attended felt like it was a review he teach as if first time he teaches as though you should know all the material very bad
18453,Leslie  Chadrakantha,he is the best math teacher ver homework for this class is online and he gives a week to do it he gives a lot of notes but if u copy them they will definatly pass the test he gives test no a fianl he also drops the lowest test grade i love him hes one of the best math teacher at john jay
18454,Leslie  Chadrakantha,this professor is no joke he actually fails people who pass the went to tutoring everyday still ended up with a
18455,Leslie  Chadrakantha,i dont know why the comments on him got reset he is terrible period avopiod him at all costs
18456,Leslie  Chadrakantha,this professor is garbage he will make you use an outside service that charges a fee gives not leniency towards anything is difficult to understand and simply does not give a about his students hes good at math but not at being a teacher this is not mit professor
18457,Todd  Clear,a little man with a gigantic ego loves to hear himself talk definitely knows his stuff but a poor teacher very poor
18458,Todd  Clear,excellent prof
18459,Todd  Clear,this professor is awsome he is a great person that knows his staff his classes are fun and well organized
18460,Todd  Clear,i have had todd as a professor on and off for years now and he is a great guy you can learn a lot from him and he is always there to help students with anything he is charismatic and his classes are not hard they just rely on a lot of theory and experience as opposed to textbook facts he really knows what teaching
18461,Todd  Clear,sorry but i know offhand what the course number is the guy is full of himself easy to do well in his class since the only thing that he really cares about is if you can give his own words and thoughts back to him comes off as a nice guy but his ego is taller than he is
18462,Todd  Clear,the class is not hard however whether you participate or not it count you dont need buy the book to pass
18463,Todd  Clear,he was really good at explaining everything and we always had the chance to ask questions without feeling like he was going to snap at us class requires you to think more openly and it helps to understand the criminal justice system better take him
18464,Todd  Clear,can his ideas work in the real world
18465,Todd  Clear,he is an international figure in the world of criminal justice and an incredible academic just not a great
18466,Todd  Clear,prof clear is an awesome teacher very knowledgable and informative cordial and friendly with students uses interesting anecdotes and tidbits to make information relative has a great teaching manner take his classes if you can
18467,Todd  Clear,felt like corrections was totally unimportant after taking his class
18468,Todd  Clear,that great of a teacher
18469,Effie  Cochran,after her class she sends some students to take catw again.i took catw and i passed so i skipped eap
18470,Effie  Cochran,although she is a little tough but if you do everything on time you will be fine she is good teacher
18471,Effie  Cochran,you have to work really hard in order to be successful in this class by the way she gives many paragraphs and stories to read each class after that you have to provide a response of the story there are many paper that has been given each class so you have to be really responsible of keep track of all of your stuff and work
18472,Effie  Cochran,she chooses monotonous books to read about court session criminals and jury on top of that she gives a little time to read pages for example days and students must analyze and bring citations with typed responds we should have a spare time on weekend should not we
18473,Effie  Cochran,do not take her any way
18474,Effie  Cochran,you have to study hard in order to pass her class attendance and class participation are mandatory homeworks every day
18475,Effie  Cochran,extremely helpful professor if you are interested enough she gives a lot of homework attendance is mandatory no lateness work hard and you will get everything you need for you to go further i would recommend her to every nonnative student in order to have a good start in your academic career

18500,James  Curran,during the beginning of the course you would think he is a good professor as the course progresses you come to realize that he is a great professor very tough on his students at times but very impartial recommend him if you are serious about learning
18501,James  Curran,a midterm a final pretty much it in every classes a sheet with questions based on the chapters of the textbook is given after completing the sheets they are used as study guides for the midterm final both exams are multiple choice questions easy class no hw term paper
18502,James  Curran,attendance is very important in his class there is one midterm and final exam very easy multiple choice if you read the book you will get an easy a in that class cause the exam is related to the book gives quizzes in class but they are few questions and he lets you use the book so its open quiz come to class and easy grade no papers either
18503,James  Curran,this professor was so nice and intresting at first he goes off on tangents bragging about family its annoying you have to have pretty much perfect attendance he takes lateness very personally somewhat condescending
18504,Robert  Crozier,he is a great professor very helpful i liked his class and enjoyed doing his assignments you must go to tutoring to better yourself he is funny as well pretty cool guy
18505,Robert  Crozier,imagine ichabod crane with a nice wardrobe about what prof crozier looks like in some weird way incredibly charming and the humane learnedness another reviewer mentioned adds to his appeal that and the fact that there are very few people on this planet from whom you can learn more
18506,Robert  Crozier,hes great i had him a couple of semesters ago and im upset he doesnt teach there anymore he only gives tests essay based but really simple he even lets you use the hes really funny and a very brilliant man makes the class interesting
18507,Robert  Crozier,he is definitely the best instructor the most humane and learned ever had

18526,Richard  Curtis,snapple face you get better then ric
18527,Richard  Curtis,prof curtis is one of the my favorite professors i have taken thus far i took his class in the morning but it was the best he is very wise no textbook no midterm or final just a pg paper every week pertaining to and a final paper he is one of the funniest people i have ever met you will def enjoy his class
18528,Richard  Curtis,prof curtis is one of my favorite professors ever taken i had his class in the morning but it was the best no textbook no midterm or final just a pg paper every week pertaining to and a final paper pgs one of the funniest people ever met def recommend him you will have a lot of fun i guarantee it
18529,Richard  Curtis,awesome guy good sense of humor easy class lots of interactive class discussions on a wide range of topics related etc never needed to take notes for this class ever weekly assignments due very short words and easy a couple of longer papers due at the end but not hard at all great prof recommended
18530,Kojo  Dei,i was excited to learn anthropology but i should of taken another professor he is ok i guess but pretty much the only thing he taught us was the definition of anthropology go to youtube and watch random videos we had only one test and papers i prefer tests because i hate writing he is a good professor but i would of wished i learned more
18531,Kojo  Dei,i was not intending to take this class at first but kojo is one of the most influential professors at john jay he loves anthropology you watch alot of and movies you write papers he substitues for tests a final paper which is pages just show up and make sure he gets to know you his memory isnt the best
18532,Kojo  Dei,i took kojo class close to years ago and to this day he stands out as one of the most influential professors in my academic career i wish i had taken his advice and gone on for forensic anthropology at columbia he always made himself available for questions after class im not sure where the other comments are coming from
18533,Kojo  Dei,throughout the semester i thought i was doing great the lowest mark i got on his paper was a b i was never absent in class always participated and at the end i receive a c i try to talk to him to change the grade he is never there he is so disorganized he know what he is looking for as for the work all he does is talk about africa i was very disappointed and appealing the grade because he know what he is doing do not take his class
18534,Kojo  Dei,you might think this class is easy because all you have to do is watch youtube videos and write some essays but not he hardly likes anything you hand in and just gives bad grades so if u want to get a b or b then go ahead and take his class
18535,Kojo  Dei,no textbooks no midterms no quizzes no finals papers responses and final paper your presentation is based on your final paper attendance is mandatory usually signin sheet if you do not write the way he wants you to write expect a highest of a b hard to understand him but his style of teaching is recommended just participate
18536,Kojo  Dei,take his class all he does is show youtube videos and gives out only articles so the entire semester there are two response papers and a final research paper with a presentation to go with it completely irrational when it comes to grading take a chance attendance is sometimes called out or sign in sheet this guy is a mess
18537,Kojo  Dei,class is easy and not text books most classes are video which helps if u taking hard classes no text books and easy writing assignments
18538,Kojo  Dei,worstt prof everr a waste of time he cant he is hard to understand he is not very open minded about other writing he expects you to write just like him all he do is go on you tube and watch videos and he grades hard
18539,Kojo  Dei,what can i say about this man he is nice but the course was a waste of time very disorganized and confused he only stresses your final paper in my opinion buy the books for some odd reason he grades too harshly if you write like him or agree with his pointsexpect a what a semester i did learn how to master you tube though
18540,Kojo  Dei,really easy class take him if you have a lot of hard classes on your schedule and want an easy a requires a few papers but the rest of the time you just watch youtube videos in class more of a discussion class if anything i learned a thing from him only the videos
18541,Kojo  Dei,prof kojo is def unique he never had any lesson plans though we just watched youtube videos all class no need for the txtbook give any tests but just papers which were fair students use to always walk in after class and just sign the attendance sheet because the class would be in complete darkness while videos were running haha
18542,Kojo  Dei,a smart man he should remain more objective though
18543,Kojo  Dei,if you enjoy watching youtube videos and only do papers pages and presentation for the whole year then this class is for you an easy a those are the only assignments you will get in the class
18544,Kojo  Dei,horrible professor teach at all just shows us youtube videos if this class mandatory then take it biggest waste of my money i could watch youtube videos at my house for free
18545,Kojo  Dei,best professor at john jay easy easy easy a all he recuires is a paper
18546,Kojo  Dei,awesome professor i recommend taking him class is fun and theres not much writing
18547,Kojo  Dei,easy professor no test no quizes just paper the papaer is very easy you can just make it up and get a a watch good flicks in this class take this professor for an easy a or b
18548,Kojo  Dei,prof kojo is a really easy professor to take ant101 with as long as you write your papers according to his own opinions if you differ with what he believes basically expect to get nothin better than a c plus you learn much in his class mostly just reviewing the daily news and talking about random issues of the day no test given
18549,Kojo  Dei,no comments

18570,John  Starr,best class ever taken now teaching at yale
18571,John  Starr,one of the best courses taken at brown easygoing clear and smart
18572,John  Starr,fabulous teacher
18573,John  Starr,awesome class
18574,Karen  Kaplowitz,there is books to read in this class and every single class period you have a quiz the quizes are of your grade so if you are not willing to do the readings do not take this class then she is nice and respected but can be rude when people are rude we only have one paper to do in that class and for the final you had to come finals week
18575,Karen  Kaplowitz,gives quizzes every class and pay attention to all the small details in the books
18576,Karen  Kaplowitz,prof kaplowitz is an amazing professor she makes you read a lot though if you like to read bother taking her class quizzes are done either before every class or every other class i hated reading god knows i still do but she makes you read interesting novels that will have you wanting to know next do the work guaranteed a
18577,Karen  Kaplowitz,if you want to hurt your gpa then you can take her she is horrible a quiz in every class and the final paper is to pages
18578,Karen  Kaplowitz,she is a very sweet professor and knows her stuff however there is tremendous amount of work and hard to ace.there is a quiz every week which end up to be quizzes for the whole semester a pages final paper lots of term definition and essays on the final an extra credit assignment but it seem to improve your grade too much
18579,Karen  Kaplowitz,she changed my life
18580,Karen  Kaplowitz,shes nice kind of chatty attempted to make the class fun attendance is a must as well as passing the majority of the a wk the freqency of the quizzes or how much we had to read for them couldve been reduced but other than that its not a hard class if you cant keep up books this is not the class for you
18581,Karen  Kaplowitz,this is of the worse professors ever had since ive been at john jay mean and did not treat me with respect in my opinion she plays favortism how could fail the damn class with passing the final and paper and at least passing some of her worthless quizzes if you hate reading i advise you to not take her
18582,Karen  Kaplowitz,quizzes are essential must do the readings they are not boring very interesting no midterm just a final and one paper gives extra credit and is very helpful read what you have to read and you should be golden
18583,Karen  Kaplowitz,quizzes are very important so you must read the text.she one on john most helpful prof i learned a lot and enjoyed every text we read sometimes readings are lengthy but its college what do you expect at least she gives an intro to every text so your not totally lost
18584,Karen  Kaplowitz,prof kaplowitz is one of the greatest lit professors ever had the pleasure of taking she is extremely clear she explains everything and she answers all of your questions there are quizzes every week but they be a problem if you read the book
18585,Karen  Kaplowitz,very nice professor if u like to read interesting novels take her her novel selections were pretty good just make sure u read she gives a quiz almost every week so0o bee readdyy i slacked n didnt read as much as i shouldve but if u read its so0o easy n interesting i promise u well that goes for lit i dunno bout the rest shes cool overall
18586,Karen  Kaplowitz,this class was great i loved the books we read and the quizzes which are taken after every assigned reading were easy as long as you read if you read then you be in college very passionate about her job and the reason shes late is because she has back problems bc she was hit by a bus a long time agogive her a break
18587,Karen  Kaplowitz,suggest to take a different prof you will learn in the class however there are quizes everyday and the readings are about a hundred pages no midterm just paper and final but the quizes are the majority of your grade so you mess up and you will get a if you miss a class not easy no spark notes
18588,Karen  Kaplowitz,shes good those people who said her class is hard dont know what they are talking about its easy all you have to do is read she gives quizzes every week on the reading a paper for a midterm and a final which is comparing and contrasting the characters from the books she assigned shes easy.college is about doing your work
18589,Karen  Kaplowitz,she is a nice person but her class is difficult esp with the readings she asks distinctive questions as you will have to know every single detail her quizes kills your grades and gets too emotional with her books she is often late for her classes and gives quizzes every class.she also has favorites in the class so she is not fair to new ones
18590,Karen  Kaplowitz,hard class lots of reading boring lit too quiz every week with confusing questions and a page paper at the end and a essay in class final crazy wierd prof aviod her if you can she is a sweetheart but her class is just too hard and boring
18591,Karen  Kaplowitz,difficult class we read on an average pages worth of work quizes are hard but ask fairly general things i would suggest getting cliff notes even though you are not supposed to to reenforce the readings it makes the book much clearer
18592,Karen  Kaplowitz,wonderful
18593,Karen  Kaplowitz,really cool lady the books are all good except beloved hated it classes on tuesdays and thursdays juss be aware thursdays class is just rereading what you already read and discussing it for minutes absolute boredom if u dont like the book like beloved ive taken kap b4 and would again
18594,Susan  Larkin,professor larkin is one of the rudest professors at john jay very sarcastic rude and mean in her comments on work submitted avoid her at all costs
18595,Susan  Larkin,i do not like professor larkin she is not helpful at all if a student ask for help ignores she is so rude and strict she does not care about students i have never seen these type of professor

18597,Susan  Larkin,dr sue is mad chill take her easy a she talks about good stuff in a health class for adults
18598,Susan  Larkin,dr larkin is simply the best ped prof in ped at john jay i have taken classes with her she is excellent take ped online with her it is an easy a forget what the other people say se gives good feedback pe minor students should take her forget these other teachers they are too serious she is the best one to take easy a
18599,Susan  Larkin,easy a
18600,Susan  Larkin,she is awesome take her for online health class easy a if you do the work she requires which is not tough at all she is always ready to help also she is very clear and fair
18601,Susan  Larkin,i thought public health would be really interesting her tough grading is making me regret taking this class worked very hard on all of my homework assignments but there always seems to be a problem when she tells me to fix something and i do then something else is wrong
18602,Susan  Larkin,loved her larkin is an amazing professor shes very enthusiastic and believes in her students she will not let you give up and will push you until you succeed be prepared to give she doesnt like slacking but she will give you a break if you need it class is fun and you make great friends highly recommend her you wont regret it
18603,Susan  Larkin,i learned to swim in her class i had friends to keep me company she just told us what to do its fine bc i learned there was extra credit to make up each absence also helped to practice a
18604,Susan  Larkin,supposed to be a health course but we still did workouts lucky a tenured prof personally i like her an easy a but having her as a prof worth the easy a rather take a different prof struggle for my a quizzes sounds more like a final to me all she does is ramble aimlessly i recommend
18605,Susan  Larkin,larkin is soo nice if a beginner you will know how to swim dive and tread water by the time done with you attendance is mandatory but worth it classes are fun the cold and you make great friends
18606,Susan  Larkin,she doesnt get in the water she tells u what to do and u do dont talk to her unless its necessary
18607,Susan  Larkin,great professor the workouts are extremely intense the test are basically vocabulary and esay questions.as long as serious about working completing simple goals its an easy a
18608,Susan  Larkin,soo nicee take her during the summer she is a garenteed a
18609,Susan  Larkin,i dont know what the hell these guys are going on about she is absolutely the sweetest person in the school classes were a breeze literally have the lectures posted up on blackboard so no missing any notes exams she would go over with you before class she doesnt expect you to be a rocket scientist just want you to live a healthy lifestyle
18610,Susan  Larkin,she is not as bad as these people are saying she is fun and if you do the are easy and read the book the class is a breeze

18612,Susan  Larkin,no comments
18613,Susan  Larkin,mean nasty attitude
18614,David  Handschuh,a quip a minute as professor handschuh does his standup in front of the class but what you realize is how much you are learning about journalism photojournalism the business of journalism and the continuing need to keep up with the technology david truly cares about the students and be fortunate to get into his class
18615,David  Handschuh,i had prof handschuh for photojournalism almost nine years ago now working full time as a journalist and looking back at his class i told and taught us things that no other professor in any journalism class brought up for discussion and2he was spot on percent right on his assessment of journalism as a career.thanks david
18616,David  Handschuh,professor handschuh is a caring entertaining and informative educator while the class is photojournalism he teaches about the business of photojournalism and emotional care for journalists and how to market yourself as a photographer or writer and this is really valuable information highly recommended class
18617,David  Handschuh,brought good resources into the class from being a photojournalist but judging by his effort this is clearly his side job means well but i was definitely expecting more guidance
18618,David  Handschuh,i was expecting more
18619,David  Handschuh,professor handschuh is a real working journalist and his classroom lectures have helped me understand the world of journalism in ways that no other instructor have in four years of college he has a great sense of humor and really can teach his students how to be a better journalist and photojournalist
18620,David  Handschuh,great teacher but tough grader very helpful in explaining professional guidlines clearly loves to teach others about photography decent sense of humor good class be prepared to take lots of pictures
18621,David  Handschuh,really cares about his students great practical advice for journalism students not just photojournalism one of the best professors had at nyu

18649,Camilo  Rojas,had camilo throughout my two years at dutchess and its simple go to class listen in lecture take the critique and you wont have a problem although you may feel that not learning anything in lecture pay attention because it all will pay off
18650,Camilo  Rojas,camilo is one of the best professors but he makes you work really hard his classes tend to be demanding and time consuming outsidemail of the classroom you will eat sleep and breatheven your work and it can always be better
18651,Camilo  Rojas,he means well but the way he talks can be hard to understand also his theory is to say how much you suck ass with filming and then hopefully that motivates you to do better i have to say it worked for me
18652,Camilo  Rojas,he is honestly the best professor i have ever had at dutchess been going to dutchess for two years and out of all he professors i have ever had he is my favorite he has a very thick accent but he makes fun of it himself so it is all out of fun he truly cares about your education and he wants you to do well absolutely amazing
18653,Camilo  Rojas,camilo is the man if serious about learning all things film this is the man to learn from he will be tough on you and very straightforward but it is for your own good if you enjoy and take something from his classes then you are in the wrong field
18654,Camilo  Rojas,camillo is easily the greatest communication teacher of all time period he will be hard on you but for your own good if you take camillo change your major because it gets no better than this
18655,Camilo  Rojas,he is a great teacher he tells you how it if your work is crap he will let you know if you handle it in the wrong major camilo is funny great helper take notes and you are fine he is very inspirational he does have a accent but you can understand him do not show up late to his class do not miss any days either
18656,Camilo  Rojas,camilo was a great teacher i enjoyed his class a lot it was just a lecture but i learned a lot his accent is thick but if you try you can understand him he even sat down with me and outlined my entire class course for the rest of my dutchess career just show up to class and do the work pass if you ask for help its there funny guy too
18657,Camilo  Rojas,an ok teacher not the best if looking for order and methods he tends to freestyle and work different projects year round an all around good person and a really tough grader his group projects is what brought me down took a different class and have nearly aced it group projects beware
18658,Camilo  Rojas,this guy is amazing he has a thick accent yes but if you come to class and show that you truly care you are fine i absolutely love him i hate that we have to use avid as the main editing software but he will help you all you need to do is go to him he is so inspirational cant wait to take his ap class
18659,Camilo  Rojas,camilo can be hard to understand with his accent and some of his assignments very clear cut the class can be tough at times and a stickler for doing things his way however i think an amazing person the class been hard but glad i took it with him
18660,Camilo  Rojas,camilo is literally by far the best professor i have ever had at dutchess everything want in a professor if you are interested in the subject and willing to work hard every day he is hilarious witty and always willing to help with whatever he really strives for your absolute best and does not accept any bs
18661,Camilo  Rojas,i learned a lot in his classes gets u to work hard good very passionate about the can be good and bad in this case good u can learn as much as in a known film sch at the community coll also bad if u get too invested.remember that still a community coll crse for credit for a degree balance
18662,Camilo  Rojas,i had him several years ago but what he says still haunts me to this day as i pursue a career in film how bad to you want it
18663,Camilo  Rojas,he can barely even speak english hes mad confusing and not helpful at all
18664,Camilo  Rojas,you definitely need to be a self starter and very disciplined to be successful in his classes he is very passionate about his class and making sure his students are the most successful in whatever their future endeavors are unlike any other teacher you will experience here at dcc more about quality than quantity great sense of humor
18665,Camilo  Rojas,camilo is probably the best teacher i will ever have in my college career yes he pushes you yes the work is hard but this industry is hard the work camilo made me prepared me for what the industry will expect me to do he is helpful easy to talk to and funny i will miss camilo when i go onto my next school take his classes
18666,Camilo  Rojas,wonderful professor he expects you to work hard and he works even harder trying to you to see the value in that a harvard experience in a community college take his classes
18667,Camilo  Rojas,a great teacher and some people realize why he says and does the thing he does until moved on from dcc take what he says and use it moved on from dcc and it took me to go away to another school to realize how much harder i worked he sets his students up for the future you get that anywhere else i swear
18668,Camilo  Rojas,i left dcc last semester moved on to a more acclaimed school met new people new professors and camilo is still the best i have ever met simply put got his back because he has always had mine love that man take his class or drop out
18669,Alice  Benston,mrs benston was the best professor ever had undergrad and grad school i keep the journals she made us write all pages with notes and once in a while will read through her comments she is one of the most intelligent and caring individuals ever encountered i think of her often now that also a teacher
18670,Alice  Benston,amazing
18671,Alice  Benston,by far my favourite professor at all of emory
18672,Alice  Benston,smart as others have said but she also you know that she thinks soo smart and soo much smarter thn you and evryone else it becomes annoying and tiresome
18673,Alice  Benston,i know a smarter person on earth period and this woman is an exceptional professor wonderful person and funny as hell true this class will kick your ass but in a good way be thankful for it after
18674,Alice  Benston,a cheerleader at the battle of jericho alice is an institution and aescrit of theater which will kick your ass is one of the best classes i ever had great teacher
18675,Hilary  Seagle,this one of those classes you can cruise through with minimal effort be ready to show up for class and to put in some real effort the tests are tough but you soon catch on to what she is looking for lots of specifics i thought she was an interesting lecturer and used plenty of realworld examples to make the material relevant
18676,Hilary  Seagle,her attitude shifts from one class to the next she acts like she is only there to draw a paycheck her teaching is vague and dependent on her emotion she can be very rude even if you try your hardest she dismisses it if possible find a better instructor for stats and probability even with her credentials i question her scientific capability
18677,Hilary  Seagle,i am taking this class as a hybrid over the summer definately fast pace but mrs seagle is very accessable and helpful i was scared to death of stats but thanks to her making she is awesome so the that dont like her dont try i suspect she put in effort if you dont
18678,Hilary  Seagle,before i took this course i was scared to death of math because it was a subject in which i had always performed poorly mrs seagle is helpful and kind and explains the subject matter in a way that is practical and accessible she expects students to show up and put in the work but then again if you do not never learn statistics
18679,Hilary  Seagle,very sour and rude she seem like she likes her job or the students very much she gets easily frustrated and seems to have a hard time explaining things in a way that other people can understand like her way or the highway
18680,Hilary  Seagle,very rude and has an unpredictable mood one day she is happy and the next she is not she seems like she does not like her job very much she told me to come and ask for help but then asked me to leave her office and not to come to class that day
18681,Hilary  Seagle,really awesome and interesting teacher and i even like math
18682,Hilary  Seagle,hilary is a great instructor with the ability to keep her students awake irrespective of the arguably dry nature of statistics she provides realworld examples that form a connection and enhance learning and recall she gets to the meat of the matter without superfluous garbage that you will likely never see again do not be afraid of stats
18683,Hilary  Seagle,average
18684,Hilary  Seagle,no comments
18685,Hilary  Seagle,the first math teacher who took the time to help me
18686,Hilary  Seagle,no comments
18687,Hilary  Seagle,no comments
18688,Hilary  Seagle,the only math teacher i have had who took the time to explain things
18689,Hilary  Seagle,sour and not friendly to students i dont think she likes her job very much
18690,Hilary  Seagle,has no people skills whatsoever she is rude and impolite acts as if she gets mad when someone understand and asks for her to reapeat a step
18691,Traci  Green,the worst math professor had in my life does not know how to teach most of the time she cant even figure out her own math problem that she created and she just looks at the problem all puzzled trying to figure it out when some students solve it first most of the time the students will solve the problem first
18692,Traci  Green,if you understand she will make sure to assist you after class she asks if we all understand before moving to the next chapter and gives a few papers to review at home she explains things very clearly
18693,Traci  Green,worst professor ever do not take her class i repeat do not take her class even if you are good in math do not take her class
18694,Traci  Green,if you want to pass math under no circumstances take the course with this professor
18695,Traci  Green,take her unless you want to fail the class she is not a good math professor at all i even give her point but the website allow me to give her point take her
18696,Traci  Green,take her unless you are a math genies or lover she barely knows what doing she teach she does the same example already on the book when you ask for help she laugh and spend half of the class time making everybody guess the answer she only does one example and then blame everything on the department tests are tough
18697,Traci  Green,she is the worst as a professor i got a b and for fail just test cause i was late that day i got a in all the other test she confused the students all the time and never ask cause she laughs btw she always give study test that are exactly like the test sometimes test were even easier honestly i pass this class cause my boyf
18698,Traci  Green,nice but her way of teaching is blah everything she does is by the math department her answer to everything is literally on the syllabus if you want to pass and actually understand take another professor
18699,Traci  Green,the worst professor ever had she can be a teacher she know how explain anything my advice choose another professor
18700,Traci  Green,she is very nice and likable as a person but her teaching style is very difficult to follow along speaks very fast with us she has to go by the departmental syllabus she only shows us a few problems its hard to ask questions tests have nothing to do with class work or mymathlab also i think the mastery worksheets are given too much
18701,Traci  Green,a good proffesor if your interested her test are difficult but just preparing you for what you have to take next
18702,Traci  Green,she sucks at teaching math if your not good at math choose her not helpful at all and she explain anything well she goes way to fast she seem to be interested in helping students excel the worst beware choose her please
18703,Traci  Green,she only does the easy problems on the board when u get the worksheet u know what to do the test r harder than anything she teaches she closes her eyes when she lectures and has an attitude sometimes also very impersonal take her class u will fail she makes her assistant wait outside till the end of class like a dog
18704,Traci  Green,professor green is one of the worst mathematics professors i have ever had she is almost always tardy to her own class but will reprimand those students who come in after her even when she is minutes late ask her for help or clarification and she will laugh at you claims exams come from the department so you blame her for failing bad
18705,Traci  Green,take her
18706,Traci  Green,worst teacher ever i swear every time i walked into that class my iq dropped the teacher is late all the time except when a test being given complicates the lesson does not know how to teach and bother asking questions she just laughs and makes you keep guessing before telling you the answer and wastes half the class time doing so
18707,Traci  Green,she is the worst college professor i have ever took because she is not helpful at all and encourage students to pass the class including me of course that is why i failed this class also she give extra credit and pretest reviews in fact she is more like hal from a space odyssey than a professor
18708,Traci  Green,i am currently taking her class and she does rush through the material she is late sometimes the tests are graded strictly she review before tests because students do not feel they can ask questions my advice is to seek tutoring however you can take the departmental exam to opt out repeating which is what i might due
18709,Traci  Green,she is the worst professor that i took because she is not helpful at all
18710,Traci  Green,ok not that she laughs at you is her way even when you are right she laughs but if you are not good at math take her she expects you to know what you are suppose to know no extra nothing what you got is what you are going to get she help you with extra points she does not encourages you nice but tough not easy class
18711,Filiz  Dogru,teach well avoid
18712,Filiz  Dogru,dr dogru was a good professor in my opinion she gave very tough tests but was always fair the class consists mostly of her handing out packets of the material and were expected to work on it with a group she walks around and if you got stuck she could explain it many different ways she is a very smart woman and rather challenging
18713,Filiz  Dogru,dr dogru always had well planned out packets to give us however we basically had to learn the material in groups before she would teach us how to do it she was very sweet and was always available for office hours she put homework grades in until the end so i thought i was getting a c when i really ended up with an a
18714,Filiz  Dogru,literally the worst professor at grand valley if you like actually learning calc take her
18715,Filiz  Dogru,very unclear when teaching and explaining not very good at explaining things in a different way test are super hard and she puts problems way harder and more complex than anything we do in class or have had as homework only goes over homework about half the time
18716,Filiz  Dogru,she is easily the worst professor ever had and i am a junior she has people essentially teach themselves every lesson or she teaches a lesson then gets tired and stops zero feedback on any graded item forces you to use webwork a completely outdated program that is horrible in every way lazy poorly put together and generally terrible
18717,Filiz  Dogru,she explain things very well laughs when someone has a wrong answer or do their homework exams are nothing like done in class or for homework difficult to study for better off using online videos to teach yourself only goes over easy examples in class and gives hard questions on the exams
18718,Filiz  Dogru,take her she gives a few concept notes and examples on the board point out a mistake and she is cool about it mostly work on handouts with people you sit with while she walks around and helps her teaching style is to let you figure things out while she guides you few graded homeworks she has a turkish accent but is very understandable
18719,Filiz  Dogru,dr dogru was extremely helpful all semester long at first i thought her accent was going to be difficult to understand but i quickly adapted she is one of my favorite teachers it is fairly easy to do well in her class as long as you pay attention there isnt much homework and the tests are straight forward
18720,Filiz  Dogru,because she a native english speaker she can be confusing when she is lecturing she mixes up the definitions of words you have to do pointless check up homeworks for every class when most of the time she will lecture on that material later on as i said pointless she grades your work not according to the methods but correctness
18721,Filiz  Dogru,i really liked prof dogru and enjoyed her class her quizzes were not too hard and as long as you payed attention did your homework and tried you would do well when you understand something just ask she is always willing to change her ways and explain in a way that may make more sense to her students
18722,Filiz  Dogru,she was extremely helpful she is the best professor i have ever had even though dr dogru teach in a style i was used to she tried very hard to help her students understand the material not just how to solve the problems i would definitely recommend her
18723,Filiz  Dogru,how dr dogru taught was very frustrating she was hard to understand at times due to her accent and her somewhat poor english made newly explained concepts more confusing got a good grade but had to spend a lot of time figuring out concepts on my own she marks things wrong but doesnt explain why extremely nice lady not a good professor
18724,Filiz  Dogru,professor dogru is extremely nice very approachable and always willing to explain concepts until everyone understands easy to listen to for those hour courses and gives a break if you need it i would definitely recommend professor dogru to any student taking mth she made retaking a breeze
18725,Filiz  Dogru,it was apparently her first time teaching mth and she do a very good job of it bad at explaining i highly suggest registering for a different professor for this class there are a lot of homework checks and it really matter if you did it right or not as long as you attempted not helpful for learning the material at all
18726,Filiz  Dogru,ugh i like her she was confusing and her tests had stuff that she had only brushed over and never explained how to find only said that it existed she was a nice person but even asking her questions in office hours was confusing
18727,Filiz  Dogru,professor dogru is a great professor she is foreign so she has a very slight accent and occasionally she will accidentally mess up some grammar while talking but she is extremely helpful and truly cares about her students
18728,Filiz  Dogru,i really enjoyed having this professor you had to work to earn your grade but her exams and quizzes were reasonable if you studied and knew your material you had homework but not very much and take very long to do sometimes she is a bit hard to understand but will clarify if you just ask i would recommend this professor
18729,Filiz  Dogru,she was one of my favorite professors even surprised our class with pizza she is so sweet caring and enthusiastic to teach she is very helpful when you ask questions the class extremely difficult but not easy her tests are a little tough but if you study and do all of the homework be fine
18730,Filiz  Dogru,she is an excellent teacher she makes all students prove and present proofs some students hate that however she is very helpful most of us having fun and learning well her exam questions are hard i took the class in spring it was fun i recommend her
18731,Kaye  Williams,i just finish taking her class in summer b six weeks course her class was heaven easy i got b i thought she was going to be harder but really she
18732,Kaye  Williams,shes ok but very sarcastic and never smiles she gives lots of works and never helps you she stressed you out
18733,Kaye  Williams,i hope it is the teacher im talking about she is a college prep teacher and i hope she reads this i didnt learn one thing in your class you are way too repetitive and you care too much about attendance in the first place her teaching skills are horrible half the time she doesnt even know what shes talking about conclusion horrible
18734,Kaye  Williams,i really enjoyed her class it was a lot of work yet it was helpful she is always available for extra help and walks you through all her assignments i got an a in her class because i worked and payed a lot of attention
18735,Kaye  Williams,she asks for too much the whole class complained about her everyday she is nice but answers very sarcastically when you ask her a question i recommend her unless you want to stress
18736,Kaye  Williams,no comments
18737,Michael  Arminio,i loved professor arminio although he is tough because he wants students to understand that college supposed to be easy but he is kind funny and when he lectures he takes his time to make sure concepts are understood he expects you to do a lot of studying on your own however would take again so sad that he is retiring
18738,Michael  Arminio,super good professor i really loved what he taught and how passionate he was about it retired now but leaving a review out of pure gratitude he rocks
18739,Michael  Arminio,arminio is a competent if not charismatic professor old school bonedry and clearcut in his teaching style nothing flashy there to teach not to entertain type of educator he does care for his students but his sense of humor is as dry as his teaching style you will learn but just try to take some of his comments with a grain of salt
18740,Michael  Arminio,he tells you what you general things for tests and gives handouts pop quizzes are on vocab that you have to define from the book and really random he tells you the class before to study he offers help when it comes to tests study everything and know little details especially for short response questions tough grader no extra credit
18741,Michael  Arminio,awsome teacher he prepares you very well before you take the exams everything that he teaches you will be on the test willing to help if you need it funny and loves to joke around
18742,Michael  Arminio,read your book and teach yourself a great teacher and he explains the material clearly after already taken the test the only test that actually reviews material already covered in class is the final by then too late people out of stayed in his course til the end sure not the only one who failed
18743,Michael  Arminio,watched him kick a mentally handicapped man out of his class before he turned to the mom and said try to back me in a corner a disgusting man and the people who think funny know when being insulted he loves to fail students makes him feel powerful withdraw you for challenging to hate science
18744,Michael  Arminio,so sweet i had to study more than for my other classes but i do not regret it at all always be present for class miss more than two classes and out no joke he will week out the weak ones so if looking for an easy professor look else where
18745,Michael  Arminio,honestly my favorite professor at mdc tough but also so sweet let his biker exterior fool you
18746,Michael  Arminio,as a person at mdc he is the greatest as a teacher he is the toughest he is very funny but his test are even funnier if you do not study must put a lot of time into this class and attendance will cause you to fail if you are tardy or absent a lot he will help you during office hours as well very lovable
18747,Michael  Arminio,his tests are difficult because of the short responses but he is a great and passionate teacher
18748,Michael  Arminio,the best professor ever loves to joke around but he definitely makes you have an interest for science requires lots of studying if you study pass his class if not struggle
18749,Michael  Arminio,professor arminio is awesome he explains topics very well has flexible office hours for extra help announces exams well in advance and loves to give pop quizzes these quizzes really pop though as he always says to expect one soon arminio also gives great advice about future schools to apply to overall he is the best
18750,Michael  Arminio,best professor in mdc i acquired an interest in science after taking this class he gives vocab quizzes that you have get from the book and gives handouts to study for the test if you study you will get an a i did
18751,Michael  Arminio,i took his week course for earth science definitely not an easy a but he gives u chances to improve grade with quizzes book wasnt neccessary
18752,Michael  Arminio,dont take it fiu has a lot professor better than him.i moved to fiu and i got a big a
18753,Michael  Arminio,he is probably the best teacher at mdc the class is not easy you have to study but he will give you everything you need in order to pass the test he is really nice and funny i highly recommend taking him for oceanography great professor great class
18754,Michael  Arminio,he is by far my favorite teacher at mdc his class is not easy if you want an easy a do not take but if you want a fair teacher who really knows about the subject or if you love oceanography take this class he is a very nice person and is writing me a letter of recommendation got an a because i did all the work and studied
18755,Michael  Arminio,if very into learning oceanography take him he gives vocab quizzes and his test are from the handouts and stuff he writes on the board this class is not easy but if this is your major then i suggest to take him he give extra credits use the book for the vocab he will not inform you regularly about how your doing in the class
18756,Michael  Arminio,best professor to have fun but when it comes to doing work he takes it very serious the class is very easy made me change my study habits for the best plus he prints the notes for the class and hand them out which all the test come from
18757,Karen  Stewart,professor stewart tells you up front what the deal is and you sign a contract and stick to it no cell phones no sleeping but its all in the contract and she will give you a chance to drop the course.first test for midterm is questions and the final is questions and she give you extra credit you cant fail this class unless u fill the blank
18758,Karen  Stewart,i had her last semester this has got to be the best course taken during college yet strict no food no phones attendance is a must but also very cool and funny there are only two exams during the entire semester the only work she assigns is credit to boost your grade this class impossible to fail
18759,Karen  Stewart,she is the best teacher everr super easy class if you cant pass this class just give up on life all you do is watch videos all day and on mondays we tak notes which is just vocab words people it doesnt get easier then this
18760,Karen  Stewart,great humanities professor her specialty is teaching dance but she does great in all arts apparently strict but funny take her enjoy it
18761,Karen  Stewart,easy a my favorite class at miami dade has a lot of rules and strict on attendance but besides that she cares about her student good at her profession and gives snacks i can guarantee you you will love and enjoy this class
18762,Karen  Stewart,easiest class therefore she is very strict u will be handed a contract listing multiple things u cannot doother work chewing gum eating have the phone on excessive absences etc this is no idle threat seen her drop people twice for these infractions other than that u are golden less than a college is not for u

18769,Karen  Stewart,very good professor she is very nice and has a lot of interesting information to share d
18770,Karen  Stewart,shes super nice and her class is easy i definitely recommend her
18771,Karen  Stewart,extremely easy a only a dummy can fail her class she tells you exactly what you will have for midterm and final i highly recommend her i got an a on her class dont miss her class she literally signs you out at the end of the class she will lower your grade after a certain amount of absences or tardees she gives lots of extra credit take her
18772,Karen  Stewart,she is an outstanding instructor she is always organized she makes the class interesting
18773,Karen  Stewart,easy she is very helpful and you can learn a lot from her i recommend you take her
18774,Karen  Stewart,awesome teacher i took her for dance class she is strict in her attendance policy and in other things but u only take test that match and she gives a lot of extra credit opport all you do is watch videos.i really recommend her class it was an easy a
18775,Karen  Stewart,great teacher outlines due mondays question midterm plus extra credit question final plus extra credit and presentation easy
18776,Karen  Stewart,she is great it is best to take during the summer weeks section and she only uses weeks
18777,Jeffery  Zorn,pretty condescending towards nonnative english speakers his essay corrections are often very unclear and difficult to learn from claims to be a generous grader but in reality is harsher more nitpicky and less forgiving grader to be fair he always offers private office hours to those who need it i unfortunately did not benefit much frm thos
18778,Jeffery  Zorn,he is so funny great sense of humor gives interesting assignments and is really easy to talk to take him if you want to be a tutor in the hub
18779,Jeffery  Zorn,one of my favorite english classes ever zorn is very helpful and a brilliant instructor he has some great stories to tell and you can learn a lot from him open to different writing styles so long as your work reads well if you put some thought into each paper and pay attention to the discussions do well
18780,Jeffery  Zorn,zorn is such an intriguing and intelligent guy but the man is a little crazy high standards on the essays basis for your entire grade but his dedication to helping your writing progress is just unmatched difficult grader but really engaging discussion overall an incredibly helpful character who is amazing at what he does
18781,Jeffery  Zorn,i really liked zorn and found him funny he talks a lot about how he used to teach at a black college or high black population college or something i was very surprised to find that my grades on his papers which were getting increasingly better while i mocked conservative rhetoric and style went bad as soon as i challenged neocon thinking
18782,Jeffery  Zorn,caring personable very distinct teaching styleinvites students to participate helps freshman muddle their way through college writing often shares interesting personal anecdotes with the class wide range of teaching experience evident one of my favorite professors
18783,Jeffery  Zorn,zorn is one of my favorites wacky in all the right ways that makes coming to class worth your while the reading is manageable but the papers can be challenging and he grades pretty hard all in the name to make you a better writer but always there for help i learned a lot in his classes and that is money well spent here at scu
18784,Jeffery  Zorn,papers peer editing before final turn in every time daily manageable readings group discussions based on the readings participation is important funny caring and intelligent zorn is awesome
18785,Jeffery  Zorn,very entertaining prof he is willing to help very nice and laid back however he has no grading rubric and is not easy but it was a relaxing class with not much reading and only papers
18786,Jeffery  Zorn,he is a nice guy and his class is pretty fun he is a really tough grader though if you can take a different teacher for english i had professor king for english and did much better than i did in english with zorn
18787,Jeffery  Zorn,professor zorn is awesome super hippy and laid back he tends to talk a lot but a funny guy.there are only assignments for the whole quarter and there pretty easy just a tough grader but his main motive is to prove that you improved i definately reccomend taking him for an easy laid back class plus he cancels classes all the time
18788,Jeffery  Zorn,jeffrey zorn is an amazing exhippie grateful deadfollowing blustering professor he is for the most part an incredible teacher but the one problem is his quizzes he is incredibly exacting and it is difficult to receive full credit unless you are able to predict exactly what he wants to hear from you class is always interesting though
18789,Jeffery  Zorn,one of those professors who will either love or despise you if he loves you i.e if you tolerate his odd mannerisms laugh at his jokes to feed his ego you coast if not he will jokingly single you out in class and start arguments with you that end with you looking like a fool considers himself brilliant constantly references his own work
18790,Jeffery  Zorn,no comments
18791,Jeffery  Zorn,very very hard grader you must keep up on all of the readings but he gives excellent lectures and is very willing to help students with the assignments very funny keeps you interested recommend him despite the really hard work
18792,Jeffery  Zorn,he is the man a little unfocused at times but a great sports fan and he will help you any way he can he gave me a graduation present now that is awesome plus he shows himself dancing at the end of the quarter
18793,Jeffery  Zorn,best teacher and a great friend still today quite an exhippy which is fine with me i love dr zorn
18794,Jeffery  Zorn,acts friendly saying things like quizes will be a breeze but really he is incredibly picky a right answer has to be exactly what he is looking for which is usually very precise i had him edit my essay did his corrections more and still wasnt an a
18795,Jeffery  Zorn,funny guy open about how hard writing is tells good stories and makes great analogies pretty tough
18796,Jeffery  Zorn,absolutely hilarious pretty hard material but he gets you through it
18797,Thomas  Madden,a history teacher lectures the whole time no study guide for midterm or final but it is all from notes and entails chose definitions for short answer and then an essay final has is comprehensive it too bad
18798,Thomas  Madden,expect to get a study guide for the midterm or final final is worth of your grade
18799,Thomas  Madden,madden is a funny guy and i found his class somewhat the tests were moderate and the only other assignments were to read novels throughout the semester and do a book analysis on each which hard my ta was good too attendance not required
18800,Thomas  Madden,madden great teacher his suck i loved lectures he was very interesting and even somewhat entertaining however i hated my ta be careful of those guys they control your grade steer clear of naus
18801,Thomas  Madden,good teacher somewhat interesting lectures steer clear of james naus for a ta in class he is a horrible grader and will make teaching totally worthless
18802,Thomas  Madden,if you have a dispute with your ta over a grade madden will regrade it and the grade he gives you is your permanent grade according to his secretary he grades harder than the do therefore he is not willing to consult you with such problems the this semester were terrible
18803,Thomas  Madden,very good lecture class makes history very interesting throws in a few jokes
18804,Thomas  Madden,a very good teacher humorous too he is very knowledgable about the subject and easy to listen to.your grade depends on your ta and also how much information you retain from the lectures tests are essays and and not very difficult
18805,Thomas  Madden,madden is a great teacher and funny too but your grade depends on your ta they give all the assigenments and grade everything my t.a sucked so this class sucked no matter how much i liked the lectures be sure you talk to people are make sure you get a good t.a
18806,Thomas  Madden,very clear very nice teacher just be careful with because they grade the whole class
18807,Thomas  Madden,boring class worthless assignments the this semester were truly awful they were total jerks one said he care if your mother died and would still make you take the midterm or turn in your paper ridiculous there should be a little compassion in this world
18808,Thomas  Madden,madden is a good lecturer but not even he can keep me awake in class this class basically depends on your ta you can easily get screwed over on that be reading about novels and have a midterm and final have to study so watch out if lazy
18809,Thomas  Madden,very good teacher makes lecture more interesting and has a good sense of humor not too hard with only short papers a midterm and final highly recommend him because he makes material more intresting
18810,Thomas  Madden,i love this lectures really cool
18811,Thomas  Madden,take james naus as your ta he sucks contrary to popular believe his lectures are boring you have to go to class just reading for the most part garaunteed b
18812,Thomas  Madden,he is a very nice guy and he makes lectures interesting with video clips and jokes only a midterm and a final unless you get an awful ta you should be fine in this class he posts all the lecture notes online in case you miss a class
18813,Thomas  Madden,take his class if it fits your schedule he knows his stuff and has a great dry sense of humor
18814,Thomas  Madden,presents material clearly and adds witty remarks appropriately would def recommend
18815,Thomas  Madden,really good teacher tests that hard just a lot of material to go over pretty funny guy
18816,Thomas  Madden,his lectures are wonderful

18819,Kelly  Pennington,great teacher as long as you pay attention and do your homework do good in this class pennington is a wonderful teacher and highly recommended one of my favorites at gmc
18820,Kelly  Pennington,this is the best teacher for math ever she really helps you understand how to use the ti86 graphing calculator and doe problems in class step by step

18828,Donna  Long,by the end of the semester everyone loved her dr long is a great teacher she loves her field and she loves teaching those who also care about it just be respectful and do fine also never forget the space in a lot
18829,Donna  Long,i honestly loved this class if interested in learning english i recommend her if your taking it just to get it over with i still recommend her because she is there to help you if you need it and the work is more than manageable
18830,Donna  Long,dr long is such a sweet lady she is extremely helpful and full of energy a lot of people ended up dropping her class because they had poor grade but it was only because they hardly showed up for class
18831,Donna  Long,this class was terrible she explain anything she would be a great politician because every time anyone asks a question about what to do the answer has nothing to do with the question asked dont take her for any class not even underwater basket weaving
18832,Donna  Long,donna rox
18833,Donna  Long,dr long is an amazing scholar and poet her classes are stimulating but she hold your hand through them if you show up for class or turn in your assignments you probably be nannied but you will fail the course if selfmotivated responsible and ready for mindexpanding feminism sign up with dr long
18834,Donna  Long,omg how can anyone say they liked this teacher i went to her class everyday did the work went to the meetings about my page paper and still got a c in her class shes a bia
18835,Donna  Long,dr long is hard and she has no tolerance for fools at all but if your willing to work you can learn a lot from her she actually made me a better writer which is something years of public school and previous english professors failed to do also kinda sexy especially when she smiles after making a offcolor joke
18836,Donna  Long,she sucked really bad i didnt get any fing help from her at all
18837,Donna  Long,i love dr long
18838,Donna  Long,i gave you a hot pepper too i know why it show up on here here have another
18839,Donna  Long,dr long is the best english teacher i have ever had i look forward to taking more of her classes there is a lot of work involved with the course however if you show an effort and work hard there is no reason you get a good grade highly recommended for anyone who is serious about working hard and enjoying their english class
18840,Donna  Long,dr long is one of the most engaging professors at fairmont state she always has a smile on her face and knows how to enjoy a laugh but on the serious side i honestly believe that she should be in the public school system to catch some people before they slip through the cracks or before they get to college i think of a better role model
18841,Donna  Long,she loves the subject and that passion filters through into the students and makes them care about english and writing and has them want to learn english in this new light
18842,Donna  Long,we thought you needed a hot pepper
18843,Donna  Long,she is an amazing teacher always keeps your attention quite a bit of work involved but worth it fair laidback and worth having as a teacher to donna long
18844,Donna  Long,i revised revised and revised it must have worked because i got an a
18845,Donna  Long,yes dr long does give you a lot of homework but worth sticking with i enjoyed this class a whole lot and am glad i took her she definitely knows her stuff and her enthusiasm shows through highly recommended
18846,Donna  Long,i love this class there everyday hungover or not she keeps you interested in writing if i have a question she has an answer she does tear apart your papers but well worth it becuase you will become a better writer
18847,Donna  Long,no comments

18863,Kerry  Marbury,he really makes you think i loved the class you have to speak up and participate and do your journals and its an automatic
18864,Kerry  Marbury,excellent participation is what makes the class great the topics are very interesting and it would not hurt if people made an attempt to open their eyes to more than a bias representation of the world this class will open your eyes as for complaints about writing the papers your opinion quit being lazy
18865,Kerry  Marbury,very cool and fair makes conversation good and makes sure we all get fed at class
18866,Kerry  Marbury,take his class it will open your eyes to so many events it is very easy you just have to write a paper every week on your opinions of different topics very fun
18867,Kerry  Marbury,he made me feel comfortable to speak in class and i felt that my opinions mattered he is an awsome teacher
18868,Maria  Fressola,amazing lecturer and fair grader absolutely love her
18869,Maria  Fressola,great lecturer and overall great professor she knows her materials and explains the process of nursing rather than reading straight from the powerpoint however like any other nursing classes be ready to read the text only so much time to cover all the materials
18870,Maria  Fressola,really wen into this class thinking it was going to be nightmare she is stern and can be intimidating at times but she is fair tests are right from lecture and textbook study and there would be no reason you will fail there were multiple curves given to offset the questions that many students got wrong overall great lecturer and fair teacher
18871,Maria  Fressola,unprofessional talks down to students not helpful rude lecture material is not a good reflection of what will be on the exams students and clinical patients complained about her attitude demeanor and overall lack of professionalism
18872,Maria  Fressola,dr fresolla is a great lecturer makes you connect the dots is she tough yeah but not horrible test is challenge but it is a wake up call and makes you realize that this is nursing and one cannot compartmentalize knowledge however this is the test that will eliminate many be prepared for it and respect it she is nursing boot camp
18873,Maria  Fressola,dr fressola was tough but a great clinical instructor she make it easy but she respected that we were students and would tell us if we were making mistakes she was very good about being professional when telling you about mistakes she always had you step off the floor for comments i learned a lot from her and i am very thankful
18874,Maria  Fressola,surprised to see that people had a positive experience with dr fressola she is disrespectful and condescending towards students as someone whose original background is in teaching her behavior is appalling my dislike for her and her contempt for us did however motivate me to refuse to ever fail her exam i passed out of spite
18875,Maria  Fressola,dr fressola is one of the best instructors at bergen she has high expectations for her students but makes it clear what is expected she is one of the few professors that truly lives up to her doctorate in education one of the only instructors that has the guts to review the exam in front of the entire class the exams are difficult but fair
18876,Maria  Fressola,dr fressola was absolutely awesome.if you were in her class you walked a straight line at the same time i saw the passion she had for teaching and nursing as well today years after my nursing ceremony at bergen i thank her for being who she is and for believing in me thank you.dr fressola she was simply marvelous
18877,Maria  Fressola,the best teacher the program has to offer yes she was tough but the only professor who genuinely wants you to understand what it takes to be a nurse the rest could care less if you get it or not
18878,Maria  Fressola,i had her for clinicals and class i passed the course and her test i did better in her part than in prof section dr fresso challenged me she did her part and i did my part i am proud i didnt fail test i love her for the challenges of gigu
18879,Maria  Fressola,i know what is up with all these reviews honestly she is wonderful prefessional and knowledgeable hear her belittling anyone answered all the questions test are absolutely doable she has a terrific work ethic and taught me to think as a nurse priceless worth some of the stress
18880,Maria  Fressola,dr fressola is a cold vile human being who spews venom from her mouth on a regular basis not sure why bcc or any hospital continues to keep her on the payroll.she gets her rocks off of making students cry you will not learn anything if you have her except how to be afraid good luck
18881,Maria  Fressola,does not answer any questions she feel like answering shows disdain and contempt for students test is crazystuff you probably know unless already a nurse if you have her for clinicals be prepared to cry
18882,Maria  Fressola,school is for learning and she makes it a horrible experience yells at you humilates you and makes you feel unconfident for no reason she said that she became a nurse for the money and it shows beacause she has no compassion at all i left the school due to the way she treated me and the lack of professionalism she displayed it was pure abuse
18883,Maria  Fressola,had this prof last fall she is an excellent lecturer however evil in clinicals does not care about her students read every nclex book you can to study most people fail test get upset over it just ace test or else operating on a deficit good luck
18884,Maria  Fressola,did not have her for clinicals as an educator she often stresses points that will not be on exams her exam is very difficult not the material but the wording of the questions and answers.do a lot of nclex and you will be fine try not to take her clinical group wednesdays
18885,Maria  Fressola,for the first weeks of class i wondered why read so many negative comments about fres however after that point she showed her true colors she was frequently aggressive and argumentative when students asked questions rather than help in cliinical she demeaned everyone unprofessional all around i got a but give her an for attitude
18886,Maria  Fressola,very tough emotionally and knowledgewise you must study find every nlcex book and read them all test three absurd keep up your grades for the other tests and you will survive ask stupid questions show weakness
18887,Maria  Fressola,she is a bvery tough teacher test is impossible she talks down to students which makes learning the subject less enjoyable be late she locks the door i have her for clinical but i heard it was pure hell no reason at all for some of her actions
18888,John  Keating,after graduating i found that his classes are the most useful in the real corporate world he is very clear and interactive in his teaching methods with classroom discussions and onhands experience his textbooks were actually used compared to other professors who assign books and never the material hes also nice and encouraging
18889,John  Keating,very boring liked to hear himself talk took attendance but assignments were easy and he was well organized
18890,John  Keating,talks more than teaches
18891,John  Keating,meh
18892,John  Keating,boring teach mastered material
18893,John  Keating,some one should teach him the material before they let him teach it also some one needs to teach him how to teach it
18894,John  Keating,again ashame to see so many disgruntled students in fact this is a good professor misunderstood at times yes if you take the class properly and open your mind up learn a lot rusty on the details of program usage but what your textbook is for go to him with macroenvironment computer questions and teach a lot
18895,John  Keating,omg what can i say horrible teacher its bad enough that he know how to teach but when he does teach wrong also what he calls cutting edge new and revolutionary has been around for um years good job jkeating keep wasting our precious money i was looking forward to an ecommerce class
18896,John  Keating,does not things well terrible
18897,John  Keating,complete idiot but an easy a
18898,John  Keating,no comments
18899,John  Keating,no clue how to teach stay away if you are in bt you are screwed
18900,John  Keating,omg this guy has no clue what he is talking about and is boring as hell
18901,Peggy  Maher,she makes you buy several books that you donvt even use she signs very english
18902,Peggy  Maher,teacher has a great attitude and is very helpful but many times is disorganized and assigns reading that you simply will not have time to do you must go to her and ask specifically what will be on the test because if you do all the readings she assigns you will literally have no other time for any other classes syllabus is sometimes a mess
18903,Peggy  Maher,most unorganized teacher i have ever had she is a very sweet woman who will work with you depending on what you have going on in your life but she assigns more homework than she can even grade thanksgiving break is next week and i have not gotten one grade back all year all of the homework is tedious and you basically teach yourself
18904,Peggy  Maher,best asl interpreting program in the region she is a tough instructor has high expectations for students and assignments prepare you for professional interpreting work you graduate from her program you will be a working interpreter if you so desire this major is not for whiners you will work your butt off
18905,Peggy  Maher,very knowledgeable of the subject if serious about interpreting this is the best find a ton of homework takes a lot of time but worth it
18906,Peggy  Maher,very strict but outstanding knowledge great teacher
18907,Peggy  Maher,may be in the running for the hardest major at maryville she makes it that way be prepared to study a lot labs are tough she will make you a better interpreter she is no joke
18908,Peggy  Maher,yes she is tough and requires way more work than any other teacher i have ever known but i understand why she is doing it it mean not going to keep complaining about hr tests squeezed into an hr min class she is disorganized and cluttered which adds to the confusion but if you learn how she is you will depend on yourself more
18909,Peggy  Maher,unorganized unclear expects students to read materials and memorize things verbatim for a quiz if enough people fail give extra credit opportunities to hide her bad teaching weekly assignments times two get to be a lot

18912,Richard  Millikin,i have had dr millikin for a lot of my classes he is a wonderful lecturer adn a wonderful pofessor he is a professor that makes you figure out the answer fo yourself the person who wrote the bad review probably expected him to give them the answers and that is not going to happen
18913,Richard  Millikin,dr millikin is a great professor and i learned a great deal in his classes also a nice guy if you have the opportunity to sit down and speak with him if you have questions just ask
18914,Richard  Millikin,dr millikin is a great professor usually the people that like him are there to be given a grade he is very helpful if you just ask
18915,Richard  Millikin,abn psychology
18916,Richard  Millikin,no comments
18917,Richard  Millikin,dr millikin is a horrible lecturer he has favorite subjects that he talks about everyday and basically you are left to read the book yourself to know anything that might be on the test he encourages people to ask questions but when you do he answers you like you are stupid for not knowing

18963,Lourdes  Espana,she teaches really good her exams were based off everything she teaches i did not understand math and she made it so simple my only issue is class attendance i missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though i had an injury five points from an a skip class you pass also beware of group work
18964,Lourdes  Espana,professor is great im terrible in math and passed the class with decent grade if you participate in class she gives extra points on the tests tests cumulative test if you havent done good on the others easy class highly reccomend

18970,Lourdes  Espana,best math professor ever had in my life truly a gem nicest person ever she actually cares about her students gives extra credit
18971,Lourdes  Espana,definitely not my favorite prof learned on mathlab then in class because im not too good at math and her teaching style good to me if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups lots of homework online before test tests and she gives lots of extra credit study
18972,Lourdes  Espana,this is the thing her class is so easy that boring also if you are into meditating this is your class weird i know lectures are on the internet you take daily easy quizzes and work in teams for extra credit the tests are the study guide fanstatic and she cares but she is not for people that have no patience
18973,Lourdes  Espana,professor espana teaching methods were some of the best methods i received at mdc provide extra credit and want to pass students
18974,Lourdes  Espana,i love her i wish she taught all maths coming from a non math liker but take advantage of extra credit and you should pass take her take her take her was weeks and i passed with a b and homework saved my grade giving that you can go back and improver score

18980,Lourdes  Espana,this is the best math professor ever had i had to take this class because i failed mat1033 three times how bad i was doing at math now i got an a on her class she is clear teaches step by step gives lots of extra credit and gives an online review before every test tests are exactly like those reviews i would take her again
18981,Lourdes  Espana,shes a great teacher she takes some getting used too but she makes you work for the grade she gives plenty of extra credit so take use of it at first she seemed harsh but i came to see she is actually a really good professor

19002,Preston  Allen,amazing professor has a bit of ocd when it comes to papers and how he likes it done but a lot very easy very lenient and gives you opportunities to make up your assignments
19003,Preston  Allen,great professor his class is really easy to pass his work and essay topics are essay make sure to turn in work on time and pass my favorite thing about allen is how he grades he is not a tough grader at all i write so good and all my essays have been higher than a b his classes boring so time goes by fast

19007,Preston  Allen,dropped the class after three classes he was excepting everyone to be an english major im willing to work for my a but man the time
19008,Preston  Allen,prof allen is a nice professor however he expects everyone to be a writer i didnt like the class at all and he used to make jokes all the time that were not funny if you are good at writing take him if not look for someone else its no time an easy a
19009,Preston  Allen,preston allen was one of the most weirdest but funniest professors i ever had he would make a few face expressions that would make a few students laugh he is straight forward with the work during the semester and how he want things done have around essays with feedback provided after each one overall great professor and learn
19010,Preston  Allen,i did not like him at all tough grader
19011,Preston  Allen,take this class if to fulfill the requirement instead come to class with an open mind and make the most out of it miss class do the work ask questions and be just fine really smart dude that actually knows what talking about
19012,Preston  Allen,he is a professor that actually makes you think in a good way his lectures are the ones that when you finish them you want to tell your friends what was discussed strongly recommended
19013,Preston  Allen,very interesting and fun class i learned so much from him you will have to write a lot of research papers but you will gain so much knowledge from each of them he is very fair with grading i would take his class again
19014,Preston  Allen,professor allen is an amazing individual i would definitly take his class again he made it fun to learn about all the boring things of english be sure to purchase one of the books he wrote they are awesome
19015,Preston  Allen,charismatic man do all of your work essays and academic marks and you will pass the class you will not dread going to this class rather you will be excited to go
19016,Preston  Allen,i would take this professor again if i could hes an amazing teacher and makes lectures very interesting and fun learn alot from his experiences and classwork would definitely recommend only at home essays and in class essays he takes away the lowest grades from both easy a and lots of fun
19017,Preston  Allen,amazing teacher overall required assignments throughout the semester three in class essays and three home research papers overall he was an outstanding teacher would definitely recommend
19018,Preston  Allen,i really dislike enc classes and the semester i took enc1102 i took classes in total crazy to say that my favorite class this semester out of the has been the enc1102 class and it has been due to preston awesome lectures he makes literature fun and makes you interested in what he is teaching this professor is amazing
19019,Preston  Allen,hes really funny in a weird type of way if you take him see the work all that difficult and he is really lenient with when you turn it in as long as you email him explaining why you on the due date definitely going to try to take him for shows a lot of videos and you pretty much just write responses to them
19020,Preston  Allen,this professor is really weird but in a good way he tells very corny jokes but you can tell he loves what he is teaching grades a bit tough but he will allow you to redo something for a better grade does not assign a ten page research paper i would definitely take him again great professor and very interesting topics and assignments
19021,Steve  Kemenyffy,took steve multiple times during my masters you get from him as much as you want if you are on the lazy take him if you want to be pushed and are open to new your guy
19022,Steve  Kemenyffy,kept talking about his mother i know what got to do with mixing slip but there it is more interested in landscaping than teaching some folks should just not have tenure
19023,Steve  Kemenyffy,my mytsagogue kemenyffy initiated me into the real world best teacher of my life
19024,Steve  Kemenyffy,take his class if at all possible i feel that any artist who does not have a chance for the experience is really missing out too many teachers set creative boundries and steve does not know the meaning of creative boundries he will give you more information than you can handle if you complete the work and show that you have not held back a
19025,Steve  Kemenyffy,i had him for intermediate do not take him he is a waste of your time he is paranoid that everyone is out to get him and you learn nothing about ceramics in his class at this stage in my course outline i should be doing all firings myself he has taken my work and fired it i have no idea what he did or why he did it do not take him
19026,Steve  Kemenyffy,steve k is easily the best teacher i have ever had in any subject he cares about his students and what they learn he is a genius when it comes to art he is eager to share what he knows and gives projects to individual students based on their interests and skills he is crazy longwinded arrogant and crazy but he loves what he does
19027,Steve  Kemenyffy,mentally the best prof i have ever had he pushed my mind to new creative levels love him if you open your mind to him you can only gain
19028,Steve  Kemenyffy,ive taken steve twice and am about to have him again for my third advanced ceramics class listen to me if you are taking a ceramics class with him do not expect to learn how to throw expect to learn about quantum physics and conspiracy theories relating to aliens of course the other two wont teach you much either steve is good though
19029,Steve  Kemenyffy,steve is seriously one of a kind even though it may take him hours to tell one story he is an amazing artist and if you actually listen to him alot of times his crazy letures really make you open your eyes about alot of stuff i will warn you if you procrastinate dont take him but its definitely a great experience take him again
19030,Steve  Kemenyffy,no one else compares
19031,Steve  Kemenyffy,too many mushrooms
19032,Steve  Kemenyffy,the raw energy comment below is dead on steve can be a little much for the unprepared but sitting in a room listening to steve should be required for everyone on campus not a ceramics major but would def take him againfor anything
19033,Steve  Kemenyffy,crazy artist and former physics guy insanely talkative but perhaps the most knowledgable person about anything and everything including ceramics of course
19034,Steve  Kemenyffy,with out a doubt one of the most brilliant minds at the university he is the heart of the ceramics program at edinboro without him the program will die although he talks too much he is mostlikely the most knowledgable ceramicist in the world
19035,Steve  Kemenyffy,you will not learn haw to throw in this class do not listen when he says to glaze greenware you pieces wiil be ruined
19036,Steve  Kemenyffy,i took him for a summer course and found out that the man is indeed crazy will reach into kiln and grab pieces without gloves steve is like an encyclopedia though he knows more than what he can say
19037,Steve  Kemenyffy,no comments
19038,Steve  Kemenyffy,no comments
19039,Steve  Kemenyffy,totally insane but very bright always willing to do whatever it takes to help his students
19040,Steve  Kemenyffy,he has a thought to offer you just have to listen closely he talks fast
19041,Tracy  Kahan,i loved her she is a little out there but she repeats things sevral times with handouts that help when studying the workload too rough but there is a lot on test i had her for psyc the sensation class spends more times on eyes than anything but i recommend taking a class from her
19042,Tracy  Kahan,very helpful and knowledgeable as she is a veteran of all topics related to but the overall course was not what i expected it was much harder than it appears my final grade was a b but i devoted a lot of my time to this class and put in what i thought was more work than was expected of me very challenging but you do learn
19043,Tracy  Kahan,dr kahan goes over everything at least twice quizzes lowest score dropped and optional final to replace your quiz grade lab reports research project that she gives you the entire quarter to do but you can complete in week she tries to make the class seem intense but very laid back she drills apa format into all her students
19044,Tracy  Kahan,dr kahan is a very nice caring professor she expects a lot but there are no surprises go to class pay attention participate read the assigned readings and do well
19045,Tracy  Kahan,she is a tough grader but very fair helpful and entertaining she gives out written study guides before each test that divulge her exact gameplan then she gives an optional review session and then she lets you use a personal notecard cheat sheet during the test put in a little work and she more than meets you half way i love her
19046,Tracy  Kahan,dr kahan is an extremely intelligent very caring professor the class is difficult but she is very clear about what she expects from you so if you do the work it difficult to do well cognitive is probably the most interesting topic for this requirement i would definitely recommend taking the class
19047,Tracy  Kahan,she is a good person but i feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc she always wants more there is no way to avoid her put it this way i would rather take human neuropsychology than take a class with her
19048,Tracy  Kahan,the readings too tough or very long that coupled with the fact that she reviews the readings in class makes it easy to be prepared for her tests the class was interesting contentwise and she just made it that much better goofy and her dream journal assignment was fun her grading policy is simple but strict do what she asks
19049,Tracy  Kahan,dr kahan is different from most professors in the psych department she makes you think she expects most students to be able to integrate material unfortunately most other psych courses dont train you for this with multiple choice tests
19050,Tracy  Kahan,uses same material for perception cognition classes completely full of it
19051,Tracy  Kahan,no comments
19052,Tracy  Kahan,great person i recommend her as an advisor she was always willing to help but still vague it was a very challenging course and i just think i get cognitive psych
19053,Tracy  Kahan,challenging course
19054,Michael  Downs,excellent teacher very engaging demands that you learn and contribute to the class had a lot of fun and learned a lot very personable and professional
19055,Michael  Downs,professor downs was by far my favorite professor in my four years at the university he cares about his students is a great mentor and his passion for writing and journalism inspires his students i took every class from him that he taught if you get the chance take one of his classes
19056,Michael  Downs,the sweetest kindest professor ever had so helpful considerate and kind take his class an amazing writer and an understanding human visit you in the hospital when you try to kill yourself
19057,Michael  Downs,no comments
19058,Michelle  Townsel,this is by far one the best math professors at mdc i wish she taught every math class from mat0020 thru including statistics and calculus i used to hate math but she made it so easy and clear to understand study and care about the class and be fine simply the best
19059,Michelle  Townsel,great teacher not a push over by far do her hw attend class do her reviews and you will do well rare teacher that cares about her students relays information in a clear simplistic format awesome teacher
19060,Michelle  Townsel,she is not a push over u have to do her hw she dont play that but if u do its a recipe for success just attend class do hw ask and do her reviews and you will do very well in her class u will be spoiled by her ability easily relay the information because once you leave her class u will c other prof or awesome really cares
19061,Michelle  Townsel,the person that rated on the april needed to study more stop going out to parties if you are going bad in class.and stop chilling in class first look for your study method and organize your time i totally agree that professor townsel is a great professor but if you do not study it is obviously that u pass any class so blame
19062,Michelle  Townsel,the previous comments are misleading she goes over material on a tuesday then will test on a thursday which is not enough time to study and complete the online tests and hmwk if you have a problem with a question she will not completely explain the answer but she has a nice personality
19063,Michelle  Townsel,prof townsel is a really really great proffesor she explains very clearly and tries her best for students to understand she is cool and she always anwers your questions with respect and correctly if she makes mistakes she does not get mad al contrary she thanks when some correct her it is rearly that she makes those mistakes.i highly recomm
19064,Michelle  Townsel,the best teacher had in years keep it up please
19065,Michelle  Townsel,this is the best math teacher ever.if you want to pass take her.the class is extremely easy and she is a cool teacher
19066,Michelle  Townsel,she is the bestestestest teacher ever i love her so much she does not understand how much she helped me in math this semester taken this course once before and failed because i did not like professor toussaint looks exactly like a frog but she helped me earn wonderful grades on test and homework if u do not like make this is who you need
19067,Michelle  Townsel,teach very well
19068,Michelle  Townsel,before this class i really hated math but she helped everything to be so simple and clear she is very patient and the way she teaches is in a manner that even the slowest leaner can understand she will repeat the lesson again and even review before going onto the next lesson totally recommended for those who hate math and want a good teacher
19069,Michelle  Townsel,the worst teacher ever drop the class lost my money the worst experience at miami dade
19070,Michelle  Townsel,you will not regret taking this teacher math is my worst subject and i was able to maintain a b the entire semester she is very helpful and will explain thesame thing a million times until she is sure that everyone understands
19071,Michelle  Townsel,i hated this class even before taking it but made it so clear and easy that i can honestly say i like the class now i thank god i got her as my professor in this class i hope i get to have her as my professor in the next level of math
19072,Michelle  Townsel,one of the nicest people ever never gets angry and is quite knowledged in the subject matter she is very helpful and even though i am horrible at math i passed with an s you will not regret taking her
19073,Michelle  Townsel,she is an awesome teacher she makes it so easy i used to suck really bad at math and now i feel like i know a lot of stuff and feel confident thanks to her awesome
19074,Michelle  Townsel,awesome awesome awesome if you need help there but her style of teaching makes it so that there is really never a need for extra help she rocks
19075,Michelle  Townsel,very helpful and goes through the work very clearly never leaves questions unanswered.is always trying to find out who needs help
19076,Rick  Dukes,dr dukes is always available to help and shows genuine interest in your research topics he explains complex things in a clear way but you do have to pay attention so you know how to ask the right questions his notes are much more helpful than any textbook he assigns
19077,Rick  Dukes,if you can take dukes and avoid lofton do it your life will be so much easier he is a great stats teacher and i hated the subject he is easy and helpful and it is nearly impossible to get an a in any other cj stats course
19078,Rick  Dukes,easy class he is the only sociology teacher with this easy of a class i loved it he is great you have to read the books but they are actual books not text books this class is so simple not even funny
19079,Rick  Dukes,without dr dukes i would not be a researcher today before taking him i was scared of what he taught now i do it for a very good living thank you dr dukes
19080,Rick  Dukes,personality made research methods much more interesting a pleasant man and great professor
19081,Rick  Dukes,this class is difficult he is not always easy to understand and sometimes him and not the topic however passionate about what he teaches willing and available to help you never condescending or mean when you understand patient he listens and he will help you he respects commitment to quality
19082,Rick  Dukes,arrogant ocd personality he guards the passing of a thesis for his pick of students he can be very when sitting on a thesis board he believes that his view of things is the only way his comments really hurt
19083,Rick  Dukes,just when i thought i take another minute of stupid multiple regression dukes assured me that i could wonderful prof and a truly decent human being
19084,Rick  Dukes,only had him once but the university needs more teachers like him
19085,Rick  Dukes,love his animated ways of motivating positive feedback from his students he is really into what he teaches and is very highly thought of by former students and his faculty peers
19086,F  Houston,very boring class no class discussion just lecture
19087,F  Houston,professor houston is the man dont mind the negative comments easy going class cool personable prof
19088,F  Houston,houston is cool in my book i found his class interesting and not boring either i would probably say it was one f the best marketing classes taken at rutgers people understand the capsim simulation used simply because they are to lazy to learn it
19089,F  Houston,extremely unorganized and unfocused sort of absentminded
19090,F  Houston,no comments
19091,F  Houston,no comments
19092,F  Houston,its like he doesnt want to teach he only comes to class cuz he has to its his job he needs to pay the bills i dont recommend him a bit
19093,F  Houston,no comments
19094,Heather  Albanesi,i truly recommend taking this class i have never learned so much her classes are very difficult but definitely manageable her lectures are interesting and funny and she is also very understanding
19095,Heather  Albanesi,dr classes are tough but you learn so much i have taken several both undergrad and graduate level you must do the reading most classes are discussion based she is incredibly supportive of your learning process i highly recommend her classes
19096,Heather  Albanesi,the lectures were so terribly boring she was very unhelpful when i asked questions and seemed more bothered by my inquisition than anything else would not recommend
19097,Heather  Albanesi,heather is awesome not easy but she is not that hard either if taking modern theory make sure to read everything in order to get a high grade every point counts because she grades right down to the the readings are dry and horrible but she makes the best of it and keeps you engaged make her like you a good networking contact
19098,Heather  Albanesi,dr albanesi is by far the greatest professor that i have taken at uccs i thought i was going to hate this class but she made it incredibly interesting and it ended up being one of the best classes that i have taken during my undergrad she is incredibly knowledgeable and her lectures are riveting
19099,Heather  Albanesi,hands down one of the best instructors come across in a long time she goes above and beyond to help her students shes extremely nice and her lectures really help explain difficult concepts and theories material is difficult if very little experience with theory but instructor provides engaging discussion to help learn and apply theory
19100,Heather  Albanesi,great professor she is very smart and very nice class lectures and discussions make sometimes difficult readings much more understandable
19101,Heather  Albanesi,there is a lot of reading within this class and it is pretty tough interesting topics a great professor knows the information very well the class discussion is a good way to learn a variety of ideas
19102,Heather  Albanesi,awesome professor smart funny and enjoyable classes thanks heather
19103,Heather  Albanesi,really exciting teacher very intense topics and use of knowledge but very flexible on so many aspects of the class the best advantage in her classes is be honest and never be afraid to defend your theories
19104,Heather  Albanesi,great professor
19105,Heather  Albanesi,very knowledgeable in her field of study and teaching excellent coherent lectures that greatly help the understanding of the readings lots of reading tests were not too bad if you study enough do not have to take the final if you have a or above by the last week nice class learned a
19106,Heather  Albanesi,lots of reading but if you pay attention the class too bad when i took it she let anyone who had above an not take the final so my entire grade was from two point quizes a point midterm and a point essay
19107,Heather  Albanesi,a good professor and she makes the topics interesting she teaches from power point a lot but it works for her there is a lot of focus on homosexuals and the class is a little more interesting when you can relate it to yourself a lot of reading but it can be a pretty easy a
19108,Heather  Albanesi,i like her she does talk very very fast lol but she is entertaining and out me to sleep very smart smart woman funny too some of the stuff she says is so off the wall and out of nowhere when she does to make a point but like lol that was funny
19109,Heather  Albanesi,no comments
19110,Heather  Albanesi,no comments
19111,Heather  Albanesi,i had this prof for both social theory classes and she is a great teacher has a very extensive grasp of theory good relationship with students and very willing to help anyone who asks she challenges enough to be considered tough but not to the point where students are overwhelmed a definite asset to the school and the department

19114,Bonnie  Johnson,she is a rude person and a awful teacher
19115,Bonnie  Johnson,treats us like we are already in the industry half of the things she tries to teach you are irrelevant to the the material the problems on the tests are not like anything she ever goes over in classthey are harder trust me i used to get straight in math and i almost failed this class drop it now unless you have industry experience
19116,Bonnie  Johnson,i made the mistake of ignoring rmp.com prior to taking this teacher i should have dropped this professor like everyone said this is potentially one of my least favorite profesors at fit drop now if you have her
19117,Bonnie  Johnson,if you like teachers who are understandable repeat information and explanations when needed and get the point then drop her class the worst decision i ever made was staying in it
19118,Bonnie  Johnson,i always read comments that say drop this class but seriously drop this class worst teacher ive ever had at fit sets up the class for you to fail talks more about her bmw than math
19119,Bonnie  Johnson,she is the worst teacher drop her class she does not know how to teach and wastes time talking about nothing she makes the class so much more difficult then it has to be
19120,Bonnie  Johnson,drop her class she is one of the worst teachers had here she goes on rants about unrelevant stuff and confuses the crap out of you if you actually want to learn something get a good grade or actually by some chance enjoy math do not keep her as a teacher
19121,Bonnie  Johnson,worst ever drop the class honestly she is so confusing and her class is the most boring thing ever everyone in the class looks at each other like what the heck is going on so not just me her tests are hard she thinks teaching but really not stay away
19122,Bonnie  Johnson,worst professor ever had drop this class asap
19123,Bonnie  Johnson,this was the worst class i have ever taken at fit a nice woman and she knows about the industry but she does not know how to effectively teach i had to teach myself the whole semester using the textbook because her methods were terrible i suggest dropping this class
19124,Bonnie  Johnson,i aced her class but her exams are hard why she words the problems differently than the hw and quizzes to do well review the exam with her after you take it you will probably get a c to an f go to her office ask for your exam and question every problem on the exam understand her wording and be fine go forward
19125,Bonnie  Johnson,she is an amazing teacher maths have been so interesting she has a great knowledge about the industry she treats you as an adult and does not believe in spoon feeding which i like.very challanging class
19126,Bonnie  Johnson,surprisingly i got a b.she is unfair and is not the best professor for this class.she is knowledgeable and knows the material but she does not communicate it to the class in an effective manner.it is not the end of the world if you get her but expect an a be willing to teach yourself everything and make sure you memorize those formulas
19127,Bonnie  Johnson,she is a smart woman but a difficult teacher because she know how to explain things to students who are not strong in math
19128,Bonnie  Johnson,bonnie and i did not make a good match nice lady and she means well but end up teaching yourself everything from the book and then become lost because her test questions will be in a completely different format i struggled but survived in the end however i would never do it again
19129,Bonnie  Johnson,horrible teacher nice lady but not a very good teacher she tries to teach she just doesnt know how you end up teaching yourself everything from the book drop the class or stick with it and drop your gpa your choice good luck
19130,Bonnie  Johnson,worst class i ever took at fit i hated bonnie absolutely hated her drop this class the minute you see her name it will bring your gpa down and you will learn nothing as a result
19131,Bonnie  Johnson,this class is not easy at all but not because of her no matter what professor you have its hard youre going to have to do more work than youre used to but shes nice and she has plenty of office hours for extra help she will reexplain if you need during class study for min everyday and you fail this is coming from someone who got a c
19132,Bonnie  Johnson,i think she was ok not excellent but ok the class was not the easiest but she did explain went over problems reviewed for the exams sometimes i think the bad ratings are from students that come to the class unprepared and then blame it on the teacher
19133,Bonnie  Johnson,honestly i hate bonnie johnson with a passion she is the worst teacher ever met she doesnt go over the work you do in your book what kind of teacher makes you learn the work yourself and do homework on what you think you learned and then go over it in class in a completely different way then the book says homework is to reinforce bonnie
19134,Frederick  Kaufman,kaufman is down to earth and willing to provide help if you need it to be honest his intro to philosophy class is the most difficult for me so far because its very systematic and imaginative learning i do not recommend taking this class early in the morning because he solely lectures and drags on for the whole minutes leaving me tired
19135,Frederick  Kaufman,extremely boring and drawn out was quite condescending and rude at times although he gives decent study guides the tests are still quite hard although i will say that there is no homework aside from readings that are covered in class that being said i still was not a huge fan
19136,Frederick  Kaufman,his voice just that interesting and he seems to daydream into space a lot i found myself getting distracted because i focus on what he was teaching the subject itself is pretty complex and therefore i personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher especially in the morning
19137,Frederick  Kaufman,his voice just that interesting and he seems to doze into space a lot i found myself getting distracted because i focus on what he was teaching the subject itself is pretty complex and therefore i personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher especially in the morning
19138,Frederick  Kaufman,passionate extremely involved in the topics and theories very expressive in presenting information great class
19139,Frederick  Kaufman,great professor amazing inspirational do not take him if not interested in philosophy
19140,Frederick  Kaufman,a really smart guy and a good teacher really god at making discussions interesting and i think monotone at all if you show an interest in the subject he will respond with great positivity
19141,Frederick  Kaufman,he was really bland and drawn out i suggest taking him unless you have to
19142,Frederick  Kaufman,frederick is exactly what i expected in a philosophy professor he takes long drawn out pauses in midsentence while he stares into the distance he speaks in a similar drawnout tone and he will ponder minutiae until the end of time overall a pretty decent professor not terribly easy not terribly difficult just decent
19143,Frederick  Kaufman,kaufmans great really interested in his students and really passionate about his work smart and fair if you like philosophy like him
19144,Frederick  Kaufman,he is a good guy a fair grader and an interesting lecturer a really funny guy and he is open for discussion and student participation all of the time but can sometimes be a little opinionated when teaching the material i recommend him if you want to take an interesting class
19145,Frederick  Kaufman,he is the worst professor i have ever had
19146,Frederick  Kaufman,interesting material but sometimes have to strain to really be interested in it because his voice is monotone like others said not a prof readily available to help either so have to go out of your way there are better professors
19147,Frederick  Kaufman,freddy knows how to run a laid back yet thought provoking class he explains theories and hypothetical situatins with great clarity and humor tests are a bit hard but assignments are rare except for reading this class or any with kauf for that matter is worth taking whatever your major is
19148,Frederick  Kaufman,kaufman is very easygoing and his open class discussion instead of lecture keeps me awake and involved in class motivating me to express my opinions and thoughts if not interested in class discussion though it can get pretty boring his voice does have a slight drone to it but he can be funny
19149,Frederick  Kaufman,grades consistently so i guess i figured out how to write to make my grades better i can see people wanting to grow up to be him i think as far as class goes his open discussion instead of lecture is my ideal format for philosophy classes
19150,Frederick  Kaufman,i want to become this man had a couple of classes with him and simply amazing in upper level courses expect to write something every week but let that scare you off really not a strain
19151,Frederick  Kaufman,thought the class was very good he can be a bit monotone at times but the converstaions are always interesting for a intro class i would say it was great the tests can be a little challenging but they are managable overall i suggest this course
19152,Frederick  Kaufman,overall the class is manageable if you want him to help you have to go out of your way to ask for it exam questions can be worded a bit tricky but all pretty much the same his voice is funny and he speaks in a drawn out manner
19153,Frederick  Kaufman,this guy seems to know his stuff really well but he is not an exciting lecturer at least in the morning snooze fest
19154,Linda  Toth,this is the worst professor i have ever taken at this university is very monotone and hard to pay attention to her grading make any sense and is very unfair been trying to get her fired but unfortunately she done anything illegal
19155,Linda  Toth,i wrote my paper for this class before the semester started and did well with it she gives weekly quizzes instead of something like or exams and it generally helps keeps grades up she is the sweetest lady with a great sense of humor she is very smart and fun
19156,Linda  Toth,tests are based just off of the notes you take in class write down everything if you can memorize all the notes then you should be fine some test questions are confusing gives a maximum of percentage points for extra credit attend class every session that it is held and you will receive another bonus point overall a pretty good teacher
19157,Linda  Toth,this lady is so knowledgable and professional but she keeps you interested and is absolutely hilarious at times no boring power point or online teach yourself know her content and how to really teach
19158,Linda  Toth,super awesome teacher you need to take notes and come to class she does take attendance
19159,Linda  Toth,you work hard but you learn toth is an awesome professor
19160,Linda  Toth,epic
19161,Linda  Toth,she makes you work but it is worth it you will get the grade you deserve everyone is treated fairly and equally
19162,Linda  Toth,dr toth is super awesome she makes you work fairly hard but her classes are fun and she is very genuine as a person
19163,Linda  Toth,she is one of my favorites if you learn in dr class you just learn she will go ut of her way to help you and to make the class interesting you get your worth in her classes above all she really does care
19164,Linda  Toth,very boring class.she is so hard and very boring to listen too her voice drones on and on do not take her every class so far i have either and a or b on my transcript except hers i have a c i was so close to failing she lectures but then tells your her tests are not based on her lectures terrible professor she likes to see kids fail
19165,Linda  Toth,toth is absolutely hilarious went into her class not knowing anything about her but very very happy i took her grade is on tests if you are on the boarder of a letter grade she offers extra credit i currently have her for night class and it never last longer than an hour and a half i love going to her class never a dull moment
19166,Linda  Toth,dr toth is a fantastic prof she makes what seems to be a boring subject pretty entertaining she likes to make jokes and will connect with the students if the put in the effort quizzes are fairly simple if you take good notes and skim through the book be in class use good grammer and turn everything in on time and you should get an a
19167,Linda  Toth,dr toth is awesome she was the reason i passed her class she always makes sure you get missed done and turned in and is always there to help there is quite a bit of material and you should always go to class but she is fun to be around especially once you get to know her one of my favorite psych professors
19168,Linda  Toth,she is an interesting professor who knows her discipline well the tests are hard and you do have to come to class and take notes but she is fair in grading
19169,Linda  Toth,dr toth is a nice lady but man her class was boring she gives the notes right on the chalkboard and she talks the whole class she was helpful when you had questions and she was a good prof just a little boring
19170,Linda  Toth,dr toth is awesome i really feel sad about the kids who did not understand her jokes particularly since most of them are psych majors who will likely go on to deal with children you have to comprehend subtlety if you want to work with children dr toth is a great teacher very intelligent fun and openminded and i have a huge crush on her
19171,Linda  Toth,clear funny she cares about students listens to and offers help
19172,Linda  Toth,one of the best on campus
19173,Linda  Toth,she has a very strange sense of humor but i found her very funny very kind and always willing to help i would definitely take her for other classes if i could
19174,Laura  Gagne,my suggestion take history with someone else enough said
19175,Laura  Gagne,kind of a bitter woman and a little mean takes some hard work to get a decent grade but if interested in the subject and willing to do the work work out
19176,Laura  Gagne,very intimidating but still a great teacher she makes the subject interesting i fall asleep in her class once p
19177,Laura  Gagne,cannot stand here she teaches based on her own personal views i attempted to ask for help but all she was concerned about was blowing me off
19178,Laura  Gagne,very funny and nice and she makes this class tolerable she makes you learn without realizing you are learning and she does it while cracking jokes and playing music take a class with her you regret it
19179,Laura  Gagne,sometimes interesting and sometimes boring but at least she makes jokes in class sometimes
19180,Nike  Mizelle,nike is a real gem and she cares very much about her students she is sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with during classes but absolutely hilarious and a little patience goes a long a way
19181,Nike  Mizelle,wonderful
19182,Nike  Mizelle,basically nike is a lot of fun but she is not the best teacher in a formal sense she is very interestng as a perosn though i love her
19183,Nike  Mizelle,i loved nike a lot of fun at the very least
19184,Nike  Mizelle,no comments
19185,Clare  Johnson,professor johnson rarely interacts with the students or uploads announcements i would have to literally look all over the class section on blackboard to find assignments as well as teach myself the material would not recommended this class or professor
19186,Clare  Johnson,my class was once a week and hours stats class she did not give us any homework since the class was so long i think sh explained things well but statistics is just difficult for me as it is for most people she let us use a notecard on one of the tests she really was great though and i recommend her sometimes she would let us out early
19187,Clare  Johnson,i completely disagree with most of the comments about professor johnson the reason all of you think badly about her classes is simply because math is hard i was never good at math but i got an a in her class simply because i payed attention if you do good in her class simply because you did not pay attention
19188,Clare  Johnson,worst professor ever had one of the worst experiences of my life she like to teach or explain anything to you if you had a question or problem with a lecture she is completely useless i think she needs to retire from teaching because i felt very alone in this process and at times helpless when i was stuck on something never again
19189,Clare  Johnson,this was the worst course i have ever taken horrible experience this professor is beyond unhelpful when you get a problem wrong she explain wrong about it and just expects you to come up with the answer out of thin air after she respond to all your emails so it makes it very difficult to communicate with her stay away
19190,Clare  Johnson,take my word for it do not take her she is such a rude person care about her students thoroughly teach if you understand something too bad when you ask questions she will either laugh or not even acknowledge you i learned by asking other students not the arrogant professor please take her please please please
19191,Clare  Johnson,the worst teacher i have ever had when it comes to math she respond to questions and is rude when you ask a question she will simply ignore it the videos she posts are full of mistakes why do teachers teach anymore if they seem to not care about their students
19192,Clare  Johnson,i took math ideas online only take this class of you are really good at math it is really hands off i say i learned anything from the professor i had to teach myself the whole time math ideas is theoretical math meaning work problems puzzles etc this was not for me i am more of a algebra and geometry type
19193,Clare  Johnson,she wrote this to the whole class i will point out where your mistakes are not what you must do to fix them it is your responsibility as part of the learning process to go over the lecture again then you should work the problems in the lecture and compare what you did with what is in the lecture what is the point of a professor then
19194,Clare  Johnson,this class is hard when it have to be she spends an incredible amount of time going over things like how to find mean and median and not enough going over new concepts she does let you use notes for one test and drops your lowest grade i got an a but the class was much more challenging than it should have been
19195,Clare  Johnson,easy class but she is rude not helpful at all tells you your answer is wrong and that be that the lectures can be a bit confusing but the math is not hard to comprehend take her if you feel comfortable with the must take it but she is kind of awful
19196,Clare  Johnson,taking my final class for my math minor which is online never had a problem understanding the subject matter in math classes but this woman really just does not teach she gives videos of her punching in numbers to excel sheets and expects you to understand the bigger picture any messages from her are rude and short with no personality
19197,Clare  Johnson,do not take her for an online course i speak to her teaching in class but she is possibly the rudest inconsiderate online teachers at fit just tells you wrong but not how to fix it has no regard or interest in teaching our class whatsoever
19198,Clare  Johnson,if you have her as your teacher drop out she is the owrst teacher care about her students disrespectful and unwilling to help she enjoys seeing her student fail and is rude she should not be teaching she is one of those teachers that care because she has tenure and cannot be fired
19199,Clare  Johnson,grat teacher very clear good personality to the point goes over material and works on buddy system for in class work no homework though up to you to study for the exams
19200,Clare  Johnson,completely unfair unreasonable and disrespectful i had to beg her to have a meeting with me to discuss a grade when i finally met with her she rushed me out before i could even finish making my point made errors grading my midterm and understand how until i explained step by step how i was correct more than once
19201,Clare  Johnson,i think a nice lady but not the best teacher i took two of her courses so far and both of them were so slow and boring
19202,Clare  Johnson,online mathematical ideas course one of the worst professors in the school not helpful also hard grader i woud say skip
19203,Clare  Johnson,nice
19204,Clare  Johnson,yeah you have to ork but very helpful she knows her stuff
19205,Jeff  Rodgers,he gives homework every night but check it just goes over it in class and calls on people to answer the tests hard unless you pay attention or take any notes he is a really nice guy but really likes his job so is very serious about the class
19206,Jeff  Rodgers,when you first meet him he seems a little stiff and uptight but then he kinda loosens up hes not the funny guy but he is nice dont get the book your wasting your money print out the power points for each class and take notes on them while he is speaking you have test not and then the final and also have to do a presentati
19207,Jeff  Rodgers,he is awesome keep good notes and try to understand be fine this teacher will give examples related to real life so that the science part sticks better i wish i had this teacher for all my classes
19208,Jeff  Rodgers,fair explains and teaches the material well very articulate gives a good challenge nice guy if you have common sense class too hard easier than my high school chem and physics classes by far
19209,Jeff  Rodgers,very nice guy and very knowledgeable different type of person all the head of math depart so you figure the contents are very interesting if you like science take notes or even better just listen to the class and understand very open for questions always willing to answer makes you think fair amount of hw really enjoyed
19210,Jeff  Rodgers,take as much notes as possible his tests are a bit difficult but if you study your notes you can actually do good
19211,Jeff  Rodgers,uptight teacher
19212,Scott  Labarge,professor labarge is simply the best if you want to enjoy learning take him
19213,Scott  Labarge,class is fun and centered around discussion there is a lot of reading but want to do it for the discussions other than participation the rest of the grade is papers if you like to write and discuss philosophy this is a great class
19214,Scott  Labarge,just a solid guy
19215,Scott  Labarge,so passionate about the subject and his students just a really good professor
19216,Scott  Labarge,he is one of the nicest and humble people i have ever met he very helpful with papers attentive to his students and funny do the readings and show that you are working hard and you will get a good great
19217,Scott  Labarge,such a great professor very helpful funny and interesting lectures might get a little boring some days but for the most part the discussions were stimulating and thought provoking reading is pretty dense and heavy but he goes over it pretty clearly and answers all questions definitely turned out to be one of my favorite classes
19218,Scott  Labarge,labarge is the man there is some reading to do but the guy is a great lecturer hilarious and entertaining if you pay attention and read you should be able to get at least an a for papers go in for help he is extremely helpful on papers
19219,Scott  Labarge,awesome teacher if you go in to see hi before a paper is due to get his feedback and help you will get no less than an a he is clear about what he wants and is extremely eager to help his students it is so clear how much he cares for his students he truly wants them to learn and will do anything he can to help them excel take labarge
19220,Scott  Labarge,he is such a funny quirky guy inclass discussions are never boring the readings were long at times but so interesting and he definitely provides a new perspective on the material that you may not have ever considered before he is a great professor and will accept any argument as long as you can back it up with logical statements
19221,Scott  Labarge,he is funny and clear in lectures he makes classics more fun than it should be quite the slow grader but understandable since he has young children at home
19222,Scott  Labarge,really great guy he is very passionate about philosophy and is very attentive to the students needs a lot of class discussion and be sure to speak up a lot so he can get to know you it will help you out when you need to talk to him or if you need letters of recommendation a lot of reading not always interesting but topics were fascinating
19223,Scott  Labarge,very caring professor and class is usually a debate be careful though if your views differ from the majority and especially his if you think differently be careful with your arguments he is very sensitive and appreciate a true debate especially if you are very strong and on the opposite side of his beliefs
19224,Scott  Labarge,my favorite prof my first quarter at santa clara very friendly and engaging it made me look forward to going to his class definitely try to take his classes
19225,Scott  Labarge,hands down not only the coolest i have ever had but probably the coolest and yes nerdiest guy i know outside of my own age group the kind of professor you wish you could just hang out with all the time outside of class classes can be a bit heavy on the reading but if you have a chance to take one of them dont pass it by
19226,Scott  Labarge,really funny and explains things very clearly my favorite class
19227,Scott  Labarge,he is a huge nerd but very funny and entertaining there is a lot of reading it is a socratic class so you need to talk and therefore do not need to do the reading all of the time however if you do the reading it will bite you in the ass when it comes to the final he is an easy grader if you do what he says i recommend him
19228,Scott  Labarge,very good teacher very interesting class and very interesting to talk with him he will help you out if you are in need and also makes class very enjoyable very clear with what he teaches and what he expects i definitely think one of the better teachers had at scu even need to buy textbooks he puts them all on angel
19229,Scott  Labarge,he is an amazingly cool guy he is very easy to talk to and even though he does not have a lot of extra time to spare if you need help he will find time for you always
19230,Scott  Labarge,the reading assignments were ridiculously long and a lot of them were very dry but after the first few classes you realized that he gives a synopsis of the assignment every day so you really have to read them all very popular during office hours so get therer early and be prepared to wait
19231,Scott  Labarge,possibly the best class i ever had
19232,Richard  O\'Brien,he is a cool guy and he is a fair grader
19233,Richard  O\'Brien,best teacher i ever had
19234,Richard  O\'Brien,my favorite prof at bcc tk him for comp if you get an a lazy do all the work if you get a b you probably belong in college prof ob made learning easynd fun i have no pblem writing research papers in all my classes thanks prof ob
19235,Richard  O\'Brien,best prof in bcc best i ever had in five semesters the man he makes learning fun and interesting take h1s class
19236,Richard  O\'Brien,es techer i ever had interesting every day fun you learn so much now i can write a research paper thank you
19237,Richard  O\'Brien,awesome professor papers exams but all really easy attend class to get the most points and doing all the work which is very little will definitely get you an a
19238,Richard  O\'Brien,this guy is a great teacher he explains the work clearly and all you need to do is write essays which he works with you complete a few worksheets over the semester and pass the final i highly recommend
19239,Richard  O\'Brien,no text book needed so you save whoo the only way to get a bad grade in this class is to not do work if you do the papers you get an a
19240,Richard  O\'Brien,really easy class you do two essay and take two tests one which even count both papers are pages each but he requires you to first turn in a page then page of them so you can expand it into a page as long as you do it you get an a
19241,Richard  O\'Brien,he was an awesome professor this class is very easy and the only way to fail by not doing your work he gives you the grading policy and he is also very helpful and he even let you out of class early if you want to take an easy class he is definitely the professor to have
19242,Richard  O\'Brien,awesome prof if you want to learn how to write this is the man interesting helpful and actually teaches so you learn my favorite at bcc
19243,Richard  O\'Brien,great teacher usually lets us out of class early the only way you can fail his class is if lazy do the work show up get an a
19244,Richard  O\'Brien,very great organized and straight forward professor
19245,Richard  O\'Brien,great teacher super easy and helps with any questions you have we have to buy a text book he is very nice and i would take him again for another class
19246,Richard  O\'Brien,i loved him he cares about his students go to class do the work and get a good grade i went back to school after many years and he helped me more than any other professor fun and interesting i wish i had more classes with him a great professor easy a if you try
19247,Richard  O\'Brien,i finally learned how to write a research paper class is great and you learn so much stuff hes a great teacher and a great guy
19248,Richard  O\'Brien,time flies by do your work and hand it in on time youll learn how to write and will enjoy the class.it was my favorite class
19249,Richard  O\'Brien,good easy professor just do the work and pass he assigned only two papers throughout the semester and all we had to do was edit them every few weeks he also teaches basic grammar which was extremely easy and it helped me improve my writing he can be a bit boring with his lectures though
19250,Richard  O\'Brien,not impressed i do agree that he is easy and i do love the way he teaches but unfortunately he seem very sympathetic towards students with disabilities
19251,Richard  O\'Brien,my highschool guidance counselor told me that he is the best teacher at bergen he is great and makes class interesting and real
19252,Roger  Colcord,horrible teacher ask questions his answer is either i think so or no i show examples cause it would take too much class time i think taking a week to go over the intro of each chapter takes more class time no one pays attention or shows up for lectures only good thing is he curves every test
19253,Roger  Colcord,i highly suggest that you take his online course very unorganized and is unclear with directions he takes forever to respond to emails he also grades your group as a whole for discussions instead of individually so you can get screwed over if your group participate which i thought was so unfair online exams are very difficult
19254,Roger  Colcord,do not take him weeks to read the syllabus to us word for word days to split up the class into equal groups that you never talk to tests are online but impossible to pay attention in class so not easy very rude spends the first half hour of a minute class going over everything we did the day before miserable save yourself
19255,Roger  Colcord,literally the most rude professor ive ever had
19256,Roger  Colcord,well took two weeks for the syllabus a week and a half to split up into groups that you literally will never talk to he does not know how to answer questions well however does give extra points back on exams if many people argue the questions
19257,Roger  Colcord,alrighty where to start i guess at the very beginning the first class or should i say the first three classes were spent on just the syllabus seriouslly he read word for word i forgot we are in college and read very rude to other instructors not very computer knowledgeable took classes to split class of in to groups
19258,Roger  Colcord,whatever you do drink an amp or something before class he is soo boring and very repetitive and it also took us literally two classes to divide into groups but the class is fairly easy all exams are online and open book
19259,Roger  Colcord,avoid him at all costs
19260,Roger  Colcord,seriously save yourself an awful semester and avoid him at all cost also the book is pointless and so sick of hearing him repeat himself times im trying to save you take this
19261,Roger  Colcord,after weeks of boring mono tone repetative colcord i finally had enough you want to know how boring it is he went over the syllabus for a week and a half class meetings and im not kidding it took him minutes to divide the student class into groups he uses all his material online like i signed up for an online course
19262,Roger  Colcord,very nice prof
19263,Roger  Colcord,uninteresting way of presenting interesting material
19264,Roger  Colcord,dr colcord repeats everything at least times i reccommend that you buy the book because he rarely uses it he takes attendance randomly throughout the semester for a grade i found the material taught interesting but how it was delivered was very very dry
19265,Roger  Colcord,okay seriously buy the book you ever use it a pretty easy class a great guy and he explains everything a couple times very clearly so if you go to class be fine
19266,Roger  Colcord,try to take copper for this class instead because he know how he wants to teach his class
19267,Roger  Colcord,dr colcord is a real nice guy and his class in general is pretty easy his tests and exams are awesome as he has a curve which saved me on both of them you can get away with not going to class some of the time but id go days out out of the three always there to help you out
19268,Roger  Colcord,no comments
19269,Cathy  Stephan,great teacher and very helpful always gives prompt email help and the papers arent really that hard
19270,Cathy  Stephan,awesome woman and teacher very clear about topics and what is important to understand for exams open to new ideas and methods and allows for a lot of extra credit definitely recommended as a teacher for any class
19271,Cathy  Stephan,best professor ever had
19272,Cathy  Stephan,cathy is the best instructor for psychology she wants people to understand the concept of things and not just memorize however the quizzes can be a little tricky if you do not pay attention she gives fun assignments in and out
19273,Cathy  Stephan,very knowledgable and pretty funny the best explainer and is terrible with answering questions in class gives a lot of small papers and tough quizzes but grades decently class can be boring at times and never gets cancelled
19274,Sam  Kohn,ugh he apparently graded himself times on this because he is not wonderful his tests have questions on it so you can imagine its each question you can retake but if its hard the first time dont expect much the next times overall dont expect leniancy its just an illusion if u messed up on the test its over for you
19275,Sam  Kohn,good guy very friendly will help you out alot
19276,Sam  Kohn,great online teacher
19277,Sam  Kohn,great guy really cool class was easy and you learn from real world experience got a
19278,Sam  Kohn,very understanding
19279,Sam  Kohn,great teacher this is the course i have had with him
19280,Ivy  Rollins,this was my favorite class last semester i think the reason it was so easy for me was because i was generally interested in what i was learning she gave the option of using our quiz grades in place of a final so i studied a lot for every one and got an a i love the notes being on webct too just an awesome class all around she is so nice
19281,Ivy  Rollins,i honestly felt like i was in elementary school all her quizzes were questions and multiple choice all her notes are on webct the material is easy to begin with but ivy makes it so a year old could pass with flying colors easiest a ive ever gotten although the class is soo easy ivy is also a genuinely sweet individual
19282,Ivy  Rollins,looks very young is a grad student teacher gives us notes and relatively easy tests rushes through material a lot and gets flustered if she runs out of time tends to be picky about small details friendly in class but not really one on one
19283,Sabrina  Berent,good teacher strict not hot at all
19284,Sabrina  Berent,she gives a lot of homework and quizzes but is really enthusiastic and wants students to learn good about giving extra help outside of class and grades fairly
19285,Sabrina  Berent,like her much picks her favorites and sticks with them such a young teacher but acts like years old
19286,Sabrina  Berent,gives a lot of tedious homework pretty good otherwise
19287,Sabrina  Berent,gives a lot of homework its pretty easy and is worth it very nice and just wants her students to do well
19288,Sabrina  Berent,very enthusiastic is eager for students to succeed very fare
19289,Sabrina  Berent,wicke dnice teacher very biased and feministic has her favorites overall shes fair though lot of work real nice in and out of class
19290,Sabrina  Berent,buon giorno sabrina solid prof clever style and even better smile
19291,Sabrina  Berent,way too strict on attendance cool teacher though very friendly and makes class pretty interesting gives a little too much partner work which is a pain in the ass but all in all one of the better teachers had in college
19292,Sabrina  Berent,the coolest teacher ever had
19293,Sabrina  Berent,very well prepared to teach the course goes out of her way to make sure students understand concepts there is a lot of pier work and out of class work but that is essential to mastering a language
19294,Sabrina  Berent,definitly gives to much work but very nice always wants to help students out.strict on attendence which she warns you about every class a lot of partner excercises some times makes class a big pain in the ass not a difficult class though
19295,Sabrina  Berent,has her favorites dont like her much can be very snotty and biased shes got her pets too
19296,Sabrina  Berent,very knowledgable and a pretty good teacher very strict about absences and missed worked and ever cancel class does a lot of partnering of students for group work and discussions pretty friendly outside class
19297,Sabrina  Berent,no comments
19298,William  Gordon,very funny professor of his lecture is him telling stories he gives out extra credit questions when attendance is low exams are really tricky a lot of stuff is on them that was never covered in class also is slow to respond to emails and to grade
19299,William  Gordon,youll wonder why you even bother to show up to class which consists of personal stories and repremanding you for not having a commanding knowledge of material he never covered
19300,William  Gordon,he literally gives you everything you need to get an a technically he even gives you the quizzes and exams just fill them out and study them and youre all good
19301,William  Gordon,its true that dr gordon is always it is also true that he quite possibly one of the most unorganized professors i have ever had he probably will never give your paper back or any feedback but having said that he is probably the best professor i have ever had he even try and i have learned so much in his classes
19302,William  Gordon,a nice and funny guy but he is so unprepared and know how to use sakai or a computer for that matter never responds to student emails never know when the exams or quizzes are going to be he lectures about personal life of time makes an easy a course hard to pass take
19303,William  Gordon,very helpful with providing any additional help needed for this course
19304,William  Gordon,nice guy but awful prof never hands things back and he is the most unorganized prof you will ever have does not have actual notes text book is very unclear you know what you have in the class until final grades are in unless you have a lot of time to devote to this class do not take it it is not an easy a
19305,William  Gordon,great professor super nice he is the type of professor who cares more about learning than grade and actually means it he is a super caring guy and really wants to help students he has many great life stories to share and will not fail you as long as you show up and be respectful and try easy class and teaches a lot
19306,William  Gordon,class is super easy if you take the time to memorize the map quizzes they are basically an easy grade he also gives tons of extra credit and he gives free questions on each exam definitely take this for an easy a
19307,William  Gordon,awesome guy a little slow grader but impossible to do bad i skipped a quiz and still got a
19308,William  Gordon,nice guy gives you study guides for exams map quizzes if you actually study do well bother buying the book never used it goes over exam study guides in class and usually gives you the answers so note taking is a must once he cancelled class and i there the class before so i know and he send an email
19309,William  Gordon,great professor but something you should know right off the bat is that tests arent multiple choice theyre matching true and false and a type of fill in the blank he knows a lot of interesting facts but the textbook really necessary you need to study but he offers a lot of help you never use the textbook so buy it
19310,William  Gordon,always minutes late but always there for students he will let you know exactly where you stand in class and is always willing to help you improve funny guy too when he relates his stories about his son ian in class definitely take a class from dr gordon
19311,William  Gordon,took his land development class s11 great class and well taught anyone who is even remotely interested in business ventures and development can learn a ton he really has a vast education and you can see a lot of his studies come out in this class really helped me out as the progressed overall very interesting class and teacher
19312,William  Gordon,dr gordon is kind of hilarious i learned a lot of random info he made me a better trivial pursuit player study for map quizzes they are an easy way to boost your grade and the tests are really not that hard mostly right out of the notes he gives out with the syllabus a good guy and wants his students to do well
19313,William  Gordon,a great guy and pretty funny in class always late which is no big just go to class and listen when he talks be fine it may be a little bit boring but tell you that at the beginning
19314,William  Gordon,late a lot the class is a lot of memorization and less actual thinking straight lecture with pretty good stories thrown in he likes to throw out trick questions just let someone else answer them wrong if you understand you need geography in life do well enough
19315,William  Gordon,took as a summer class very very intelligent professor never learned so much from a week level class grading is very fair and you know he wants everyone to do well def take this class with this professor
19316,William  Gordon,attendance was so low for every class and fellow students constantly brought computers to surf facebook during lectures gordon could have made the classes dry and unbearable but he really made them fun as long as you study what he goes over on the exam review the tests are simple you have to do some simple research on your own sometimes
19317,William  Gordon,prof gordon is actually quite awesome just so many students now fail to know anything about geography and one in my class even quoted the subject as useless i received as but because of the stupidity of the students he had to grade on a curve so they all fail shame on the youth of america not dr gordon
19318,David  Cooper,very clear weekly quizes are easy and the curve at the end of the class makes it impossible to do bad
19319,David  Cooper,require you to think the way he thinks and sometimes quite difficult to see what getting at he never uses the assigned text and his lecture slides are often unclear and loaded with mathematical jargon he makes up for all this with a very generous grading scale that makes it almost impossible to get anything less than a b
19320,David  Cooper,mostly the man is just mean
19321,David  Cooper,coop is an ass but he knows it i think just decided to run with it feel free to make fun of him he seems to enjoy it the class bad but you need to do some thinking on your own
19322,David  Cooper,classes are not really necessary but experiments are fun and the exams too difficult i really enjoy the case studies that he brings up in class he definitely is one of those teachers that you either like or you dont
19323,David  Cooper,i strongly dislike this man class is interesting enough but he spends the whole time talking about these interesting case studies and experiments that do not help you at all on the test the weekly quizzes are a pain and regularly going to class and reading book help you on the tests
19324,David  Cooper,hes not a bad teacher hes really boring with his powerpoint presentations but experiments make the class interesting basically no work all semester except for final
19325,David  Cooper,very helpful insightful and capable of applying economic theory to a multitude of markets and arenas
19326,David  Cooper,not a very good teacher comes off as kind of a jerk
19327,David  Cooper,has clear expectations of his students and offers lots of out of class time to help does his best to make a difficult class managable and useful especially to econ majors
19328,David  Cooper,effective command of material and can teach well class is also enjoyable with in class experiments
19329,David  Cooper,what a jerk
19330,David  Cooper,interesting class and good professor extremely knowledgeable and sometimes intimidating but is not a difficult grader
19331,David  Cooper,no comments
19332,David  Cooper,good professor puts a lot of effort into the course
19333,David  Cooper,no comments
19334,David  Cooper,my best non engineering professors loved the course
19335,David  Cooper,you either loved him or hated him for the most part i loved him as a prof
19336,David  Cooper,no comments
19337,David  Cooper,kinda arrocant but a good teacher
19338,Richard  Travisano,i took my first class with him the summer before my freshman year it was in and my first college course and i loved him i took another course later with him and loved him also then it has been many years but his teaching still impacts my life he was one of the reasons why i eventually changed my major to sociology
19339,Richard  Travisano,at first i though this course was some sort of joke and this was what sociology was all about after taking two classes i realise this is bs do not take this class unless you want to hear about his disrespect you will not learn nothing
19340,Richard  Travisano,this class is ridiculous i would not recommend attendance mandatory but if you want to pass you should probably go interesting to listen to in class but there are only two exams solely based on stories he tells in class and i learned absolutely nothing about sociology
19341,Richard  Travisano,best professor i had in college he was my professor in the and changed my life by encouraging critical thinking and creative ideas
19342,Richard  Travisano,been out of college for years and still think about him unique and true changed my way of thinking about life sometimes a loaf of bread is just a loaf of bread
19343,Richard  Travisano,trav is great his class is more a philisophical look at sociology than a true scientific one but is well worth hearing his point of view his lectures are always amusing though it can be difficult to link his anecdotes to the subject material at times exams are easy and bend over backwards to help if you ask
19344,Richard  Travisano,he saved my life i came to the university in i had just gotten a ged and was enrolled in the talent devlopment program prof trav as everyone called him became my friend more than anything he listened to me and accepted my short comings made me feel i belonged and i was worthy of an education very dear man to me
19345,Richard  Travisano,love this class all you have to do is show up and listen the exams are super easy if you come to class hes a really funny guy with a unique sense of humor one of a kind at uri
19346,Richard  Travisano,absolute worst professor ever had gives uri a bad name we took a midterm on oct and get it back until december sure he tells entertaining stories but he really has no interest in his students his lectures are to hear himself speak a total of students show up and he seem to care
19347,Richard  Travisano,funny interesting knowledgeable and an overall great teacher and person
19348,Richard  Travisano,i really enjoyed his class great guy he was fun and interesting to listen to some of the points he makes really make you think
19349,Richard  Travisano,this man is really hard to follow and his questions really have nothing to do with the subject it is very easy to get a good grade but if you actually want to learn something i would not recommend this class
19350,Richard  Travisano,prof travisano is great he really makes class interesting he is paramount when it comes to the subject matter and he has great life experiences to match i think he is truely unique and wish he taught more courses in sociology he is brillant and down to earth which makes him exceptional
19351,Richard  Travisano,professor travisano was and i presume still is second to none
19352,Richard  Travisano,everyone needs a break and that where travisano comes in place hilarious well respected by other staff because taught at uri for so long he can teach how he wants too nobody should be complaining about him because those who are are the same ones who are so happy to get an a so appreciate him
19353,Richard  Travisano,awful so ashamed i attend a university that allows this man to teach and waste salary on his schtick is being wacky and telling stories but this is ridiculous to be listening to in a classroom setting avoid at all costs
19354,Richard  Travisano,a very interesting man scattered ideas but offers a unique perspective of the world hard to get in contact with travisano has experiences that he mind sharing that no other professor would dare to talk about
19355,Richard  Travisano,biggest waste of time and money his exams are a joke and is more interested in entertaining than actually teaching
19356,Richard  Travisano,honestly he is a terrible teacher and does not teach you a darn thing his class is full of nonsense and his tests are just full of ridiculous questions that he like pulled out of nowhere he really needs to learn how to teach
19357,Richard  Travisano,travisano is the man if you go to class everyday which is worth it because his lectures are always hilarious then you will have no problem getting an a even if you read the books
19358,Les  Boggess,this professor is awesome i highly recommend taking his class you be disappointed
19359,Les  Boggess,he is awesome
19360,Les  Boggess,awesome his study guides are literally the impossible not to receive an a in this class ud have to be a moron no attendance is taken
19361,Les  Boggess,awesome
19362,Les  Boggess,fun teacher good guy
19363,Les  Boggess,great professor lots of extra credit and he gives all the questions to the test the class before
19364,Les  Boggess,no comments
19365,Les  Boggess,boggess is awesome sure easy and you dont learn much but hell yeah cool as hell a good man
19366,Les  Boggess,best of the best dean van bibber could learn a lot from him
19367,Les  Boggess,needs to go take him if you like boring classes
19368,Les  Boggess,very easy and very nice gives you worksheets with all the test questions on them great teacher
19369,Les  Boggess,no comments
19370,Les  Boggess,his classes are extremely boring we plays entirely too many videos he really teach anything his study guides are exactly what is on the test you only have to go to class to take the test because he has no attendance policy
19371,Les  Boggess,good teacher provides good study sheets
19372,Les  Boggess,very easy study guides were taken directly from the book and then the tests are exactly like the study guide
19373,Les  Boggess,one of the best teachers fsc has to offer on the same level as dean van bibber has the experience to back up the book knowlege highly recommended
19374,Les  Boggess,one of the best teachers i have ever had do not see how anyone could fail his tests
19375,Les  Boggess,he is a very good teacher and part of one of the best well rounded departments at fsc the cj department is outstanding in teaching as well as having experience in different fields in which they teach now
19376,Les  Boggess,very intelligent and a hard worker
19377,Les  Boggess,outstanding teacher
19378,Tulasi  Joshi,his class was unbearable
19379,Tulasi  Joshi,terrible professor was extremely easy for me to do the work in the class but because it all revolves around study guides and learning where countries were on the map i can assure you that this class is a waste of time and that this teacher will spend of the class time talking about his grandson or other things other then teaching
19380,Tulasi  Joshi,do not recommend
19381,Tulasi  Joshi,worthless lump of a man currently in his class and does not teach his class sessions are him talking about unrelated topics and assigning a study guide spanning two chapters that he talk about at all then he has you turn them in and then do a test a few weeks later with the same questions terrible prof the book is the only teacher
19382,Tulasi  Joshi,he is not a terrible teacher the class is really very easy you just have to tell him every class period that he forgot something you expect him to do what he is supposed to just follow the study guide and the tests are pretty well straight off that.also sit in the front and talk alot he will help you more if he knows interested
19383,Tulasi  Joshi,very hard not helpful
19384,Tulasi  Joshi,joshi is a rude man with a huge ego i can understand him.this issue isnt his speech half of what he says is to the class he messed up my gpa and cares little about students while writing a important paper he used my laptop to answer a question he then told me to turn it off because i was distracting the class do not take
19385,Tulasi  Joshi,good man
19386,Tulasi  Joshi,take him he to grade things and loses everything if you have to take him make copies of everything class is not structured or organized in any way some study guide questions in the book or on the internet he help you ruined my
19387,Tulasi  Joshi,talks about everything buy geography give me credit for quizes and a test he forgot
19388,Tulasi  Joshi,if you wanna class that you take very little noted cant understand the teacher and you learn nothing in class then this is the teacher for you he talks bout his life more than anything you do need to stay with the schedule or you will fail map tests are easy and chapter tests are easy and you can retake them but i wouldnt pick his class to tak
19389,Tulasi  Joshi,the first day he seems hard to understand but you get used to it his class as a whole is simple do the study guides and homework he gives you attendance is not necessary as long as you keep up with the work if you ask him a question though he tends to turn it around and ask you the exact question you just asked him so not helpful in that sense
19390,Tulasi  Joshi,he is as easy as they come if u pass his class u should go back to kidergarten and for the ones who understand him open up to the world not everybody in in the america for this matter talk with a country accent
19391,Tulasi  Joshi,difficult class hard to understand
19392,Tulasi  Joshi,no comments
19393,Tulasi  Joshi,terrible teacher hard to understand and makes it a point to single out students for his own amusement i would not reccomend him unless you are from nepaul like him
19394,Tulasi  Joshi,study the study guides they are the test and the ticket to an a hard to understand because of his accent but the class that tough
19395,Tulasi  Joshi,worst teacher i counted once and he said right times in a half hour i have no idea what he is ever saying right
19396,Tulasi  Joshi,i hated this class it was a waste of time and money the first week all you talk about is his althritis you dont do any geography unless you do the study guides he is a very nice person but he also is rude and belittles students for expressing their thoughts he also talks bad america
19397,Tulasi  Joshi,no comments
19398,Andrew  Howard,great teacher
19399,Andrew  Howard,mr howard was a great teacher laid back and easygoing the type of guy that you could go to a bar and get a beer with learned a lot from him
19400,Andrew  Howard,very laid back and easy going very fun teacher only bad thing is he is a state fan lol
19401,Andrew  Howard,no comments
19402,Joann  Chirico,chirico is unorganized and hard to follow
19403,Joann  Chirico,a very nice lady but this class is extremely boring she makes you do five papers throughout the semester on the inclass exercises which hard to do a very fair and easy grader there are four quizzes as a means of evaluation no tests which is nice the class hard but take another class for the gs credit
19404,Joann  Chirico,absolutely terrible class boring and extremely feminist only bonus given away is only for women and some things she makes mandatory have no relevance to the class complete waste of time
19405,Joann  Chirico,very smart
19406,Joann  Chirico,she was very dry and boring kindof graded weird i really think she liked that class a lot she is more of a soc teacher so i never felt her dedication to crimj
19407,Joann  Chirico,no comments
19408,Joann  Chirico,she was very passionate abt what she taught but not clear on what she was teaching and wanted for assignments overall her classes are very boring
19409,Joann  Chirico,such a sweetheart some of her assignments were a little tedious but overall i loved this course i thought that the service learning volunteering she makes us do would have been a pain but it actually helped me find out what i want to major in premedicine dr chirico is great
19410,Joann  Chirico,very good teacher even though she is a little into manbashing i would advise anyone to take her classes as she is a very fair and intellingent instructor
19411,Joann  Chirico,could this class be any more depressing everyday i go and learn about how horrible the united states is in the world and all the dozens and dozens of things that are wiping out babies everyday a day pass that she warn of world war ii which will be about drinking water save your aquafina
19412,Joann  Chirico,a big feminist play along or you will not get a good grade
19413,Joann  Chirico,this class should not be taken by any normal student at penn state beaver you need to read and learn to present arguments to things you normally wouldnt think of arguing she is a brilliant teacher probably one of the best on campus she is also a very good person to go to for advice because she is very knowledgable on most topics
19414,Joann  Chirico,she is slamming hot
19415,Joann  Chirico,dr chirico is an awesome teacher she likes when you have an opinion and even disagree with her opinions sometimes as long as you talk and have an opinion in class she will love you the hours of community service can be rough but rewarding in the end she tries to help the community
19416,Joann  Chirico,she is a great professor who really knows what doing unfortunately her courses are very difficult and not worth it do not take this course for a simple gs credit unless you like writing atleast paper a week and hrs community service take econ for the same gs credit very easy
19417,Joann  Chirico,great teacher lots of fun also very hot
19418,Joann  Chirico,enjoyed her classes greatly lots of work to be done but its worth it in the end you can learn a great deal if you are just willing to do the work and try hard stop complaining about the work load and do it
19419,Joann  Chirico,good teacher but personally i like ms muroski at hazleton better
19420,Joann  Chirico,great class great teacher very clear lectures deemphasizes test scores and puts more weight on papers because they are clearer indications of what we actually learn
19421,Joann  Chirico,one of the best at psu beaver maybe disorganized but admittedlet so and she afraid to laugh at herself funny smart and hot for her age
19422,Rina  Yarmish,amazing i took an express week course for m2 that i was nervous about since math one of my strong suites but prof yarmish goes slow and makes everything crystal clear very patient and she truly wants all her students not just to pass but to understand the material for future math courses you may need to take
19423,Rina  Yarmish,professor yarmish is tough she has a cold attitude and care about her students very cut and dry and take any effort into consideration downgrades your grade for the smallest thing
19424,Rina  Yarmish,very clear makes sure everyone understands listen in class and do the assignments and do great also make sure to ask if something is not clear
19425,Rina  Yarmish,no if you are not good in math take her one of those professors who expect you to know everything before you came to class
19426,Rina  Yarmish,she is great a little bit boring but makes sure everyone gets everything i guarantee after this class you will understand all you understand before gives a lot of homework but you have to turn it in however it helps a lot to do homework take her if you want to know math
19427,Rina  Yarmish,she is good professor give a lot of homework but you will understand everything
19428,Rina  Yarmish,she is the best professor i had to finally help me understand math i love her teaching style she just tell you how to do the problem but explains why something is for what it is the thing with math is there are sometimes more than one way to do a problem but she tells you her way and explains it well
19429,Rina  Yarmish,shes a great and very professional person within days i was able to complete all my questions and most important part of her teaching is that she is taking her time to explain and wants every one to understand before move on to the next problem i would highly recommend her shes very pleasant thanks prof
19430,Rina  Yarmish,she knows how to teach the math and you will never leave her class with questions on clarity gives homework everyday but its only to benefit you took her spring and i learnt a lot in her class you wont get a better education than what she can offer her students and she cares and will always help with any subject matter you may need
19431,Rina  Yarmish,best math professor ever i took her for math and totally changed my whole perspective on math she gives homework everyday and goes over it the next day in class she is very patient and explains everything crystal clear she makes math fun i would take any of her over and over she gives two exams and the final
19432,Rina  Yarmish,i took her math express one week class so things were rushed through but an excellent patient and thorough educator who clearly enjoys math
19433,Rina  Yarmish,very clear and very helpful there is no way that you will get a bad grade or a failing grade she makes math fun
19434,Rina  Yarmish,listen in class it really helps
19435,Rina  Yarmish,all you got to do is do the hw and youll get a great grade my whole class did well because we met up to do the hw it was well worth the work yes i said work you do have to do somthing for the grade
19436,Rina  Yarmish,i know where to start or end her class is definitely not fun but she is very very clear probably good especially in math if you are interested in a hardcore math class take hers she is the chair of the math and computer science department so she misses some days too because of meetings overall i would rate her a b the rest i
19437,Rina  Yarmish,she is the most boring teacher in the world especially in her two hour class do not take her class whatsoever she looks like she is back from the dead
19438,Rina  Yarmish,get outta the sixties you freak
19439,Rina  Yarmish,i recommend prof yarmish she was always there to help me if i needed extra help shes available to answer your questions and she teaches in a clear articulate way take her if you need math
19440,Rina  Yarmish,whatever you do do not take a class with her truly terrible woman care one bit save yourself the pain and suffering take another prof
19441,Rina  Yarmish,she is there to make it harder on the poor students going to her class is like going to scary movie
19442,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,go to lecture take notes study be fine unlike many professors she has a heart so talk to her if things workin out so hot for you and work with you
19443,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,dr w has high expectations but that will make us successful when we get out of psbvr when the student puts forth effort she will go out of her way to help even outside of class she cares about her students but gets frustrated when people fulfill their potential when she came here the dept was in chaos she saved it my favorite prof
19444,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,a very hard class but an awesome teacher all the people that say she teach well are just too lazy to apply concepts she want you to memorize she wants you to actually learn something and gives you stories that apply to concepts so you understand the material better
19445,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,dr wroble is the best professor ever had yes the work she assigns is very hard and very challenging but a psych degree is not going to be handed to you on a silver platter you have to work for it sure the bad ratings are from students that expect to have handed to them
19446,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,a heinous person so negative for someone in the field of psychology i would not recommend taking any of her classes or going to this school for this degree
19447,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,but fair needs to loosen up some as she is very rigid not real personable but good as a teacher with a genuine interest in wanting us to succeed
19448,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,no comments
19449,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,she was very interesting with her stories which kept me awake for that hour i learned the most from her than any other professor she wasnt the easiest of professors to follow because you actually had to go to class to get the information but she did her job
19450,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,i was going to become a psychologist until after taking her classes by the end of the class i would have got an a on what her life was about her family and her trips to london a waste of time trying to learn about the actual topic cause she also goes on about herself
19451,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,she was the worst teacher i have ever had she took something i loved and made me hate it all she talks about is her kid and herself we all had to teach ourselves the entire course do not take her course
19452,Minnhoi  Wroble- Biglan,not a great teacher like to talk abou things over and over again repeats herself and will not make topics clear teaches poorly and teaches only what she wants to say not what we need to know
19453,Iwan  Alexander,this class is ridiculously hard with that in mind he tries to make it understandable the accent makes class worth going to a fun guy the homeworks and tests are completely brutal though
19454,Iwan  Alexander,great professor he really cares about his class and works very hard at adjusting it according to student feedback ignore comments about previous years because changed since them not an easy class but devoted to helping you understand the material
19455,Iwan  Alexander,amazing professor entertaining and really loves the material difficult class but rewarding
19456,Iwan  Alexander,class was kinda tough higher level engineering math but he did pretty well teaching it uses a lot of his own problems for homework does some things that in the book great guy makes jokes all class he really gets into what teaching which helps with learning even if you really understand it
19457,Iwan  Alexander,lectures are a waste read from book
19458,Iwan  Alexander,crikey got a carrot in a microwave
19459,Iwan  Alexander,enthusiastic helpful encouraging tough but fair
19460,Iwan  Alexander,my only advise is to do the example problems and tests he takes the test questions directly from them
19461,Iwan  Alexander,lectures are boring and so hard to follow but it is just all math so its hard to blame him for that book is very helpful i pulled an allnighter the nite before second test just reading the book and got almost without ever paying attentionin clas
19462,Iwan  Alexander,really great when he makes a mistake on the board and corrects it minutes later but propogate that correction through everything else but in general thermo is really really hard so tough to blame him
19463,Iwan  Alexander,read the book lectures were mostly a waste
19464,Iwan  Alexander,avoid him if you can but if you do take it from him be sure to read the book it is a good way to learn the material much better than lecture
19465,Iwan  Alexander,lectures can be confusing because he doesnt explain his derivations very well youll need the book to explain some things tests are kinda tricky
19466,Iwan  Alexander,crazy brit
19467,Iwan  Alexander,hard class busted my balls all semester
19468,Iwan  Alexander,no comments
19469,Iwan  Alexander,knows his
19470,Iwan  Alexander,no comments
19471,Iwan  Alexander,avoid taking spurious nots in class he derives too much but gets to there
19472,Iwan  Alexander,no comments
19473,Ian  Short,one of the worst professors i have ever encountered stay as far away as possible
19474,Ian  Short,very rude
19475,Ian  Short,great professor if i was majoring in astro physics definitely take more of his courses good teacher and takes the time to help you but he is pretty busy i went to every class and tried it was a small class and for those of us that tried i think we all did pretty well recommend him to anyone
19476,Ian  Short,nice guy but i took an astronomy course for arts students expected us to know all these complicated physics related things i suppose it would have been fine but i was more interested in looking at stars than learning the equations for the doppler effect and stuff
19477,Ian  Short,only had him for a lab instructor but i wish i could take his course again extremely friendly and explained things clearly attended a public lecture he gave as well which was awesome he knows his stuff knows how to teach it and is helpful and nice while doing so need more profs like him
19478,Ian  Short,great excellent pictures good use of always willing to answer says no to copy his note off the board copy everything is helpful with assignments and keep you paying attention the midterm and finals were fair you study then you fail great first year proff
19479,Ian  Short,great guy and knows his stuff he clearly defines and shows everything either on his projector or the board really good at explaining things keep on top of work or oit will overwhelm you
19480,Ian  Short,great guy very clear and knows what talking about the tests were very straight foreward as were the assignments and his odd expressions and variety of coloured markers help keep your attention if starting to drift keep on top of the work otherwise it will seem harder than it is
19481,Ian  Short,an all right teacher his diagrams are really helpful and if you have a question he does his best to answer it the only problem is that he give out any handouts he expects you to read the entire textbook
19482,Judy  Berasi,these comments accurately describe the class she does scream at the top of her lungs often which is annoying considering my class starts at am she goes off topic way to often talking about things that have no relevance to the class today we were supposed to review for the test but we ran out of time and able to
19483,Judy  Berasi,i had queen b last spring we still chat and she is extremely helpful with career advice even after you complete her class definitely worth taking speech class even if you need it
19484,Judy  Berasi,fun teacher just study for her two tests and take all her advice for your speeches
19485,Judy  Berasi,ms berasi was a very excellent teacher i brought in a dog for one of my speeches on teen depression she allows students to think with an open mind and i loved that overall have to do three speeches and bring in a poster board for each one it was not a hard class but time consuming
19486,Judy  Berasi,she deffinately has her favorites and makes that clear seen people do terrible on speeches and still get better grades then me just depends on what mood shes in spend the whole class pleasing to her wants and not actually learning the class is passable you just gota put up with her ranting and insanity
19487,Judy  Berasi,been teaching for years excellent at it she cares about her students you will have to do speeches if you pick topics that are compelling that no one else in the class would even think about doing then you will pass her class with a good grade not easy a though you will have to work for it
19488,Judy  Berasi,it is an easy class however she has her obvious favorites you could do an incredible job on your speech but if she like you or your topic you will get a c just be very politically correct and you will do fine
19489,Judy  Berasi,she screamed at the top of her lungs at my class on a regular basis it matter if you have a great speech unless you do absolutely everything her way and she has her obvious favorites
19490,Judy  Berasi,her class is a lot of fun work hard and you will get a good grade
19491,Judy  Berasi,her class is a lot of fun just follow her lead have a good attitude and put forth good effort students from years gone by stay in touch with her she will go outnof her way to help you
19492,Judy  Berasi,she is easy if she likes you and you will know if she likes you be outgoing and funny and do well she really gives like if you are funny and bring props out of your ass if she like you you will get its that simple
19493,Judy  Berasi,if she likes you and your topic you will get a good grade on your presentation if she interested in your topic she will pick apart your presentation you can put all your time into your speech and if she like you do well very biased teacher and objective in grading
19494,Judy  Berasi,first test all definitions second test make up stuff the rest of the course pretty easy just be outgoing and fun and get an a
19495,Judy  Berasi,very and very demanding.i only lasted one day.for each student has to decorate a poster and dress the part.it can get expensive.she called to see why i in class and yelled and lectured me when i told her i dropped it
19496,Judy  Berasi,she was nice but way to bouncy for me everything had to be done her way exactly she should realize there are different styles
19497,Judy  Berasi,very nice funny and very helpful she is one of those teachers who is willing to help you all the time she is very nice
19498,Imafidon  Olaye,goes on pointless tangents a lot tends to talk about himself more than about what we should actually be learning read the textbook if you want to pass grades fairly but you need to put work into it in order to pass
19499,Imafidon  Olaye,he is an okay professor he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult he grades speeches on the harsher side it is not really easy for many people to speak in front of others and i feel like he forgets that he always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it
19500,Imafidon  Olaye,olay is a professor that makes you work for the grade you want there are presentations and the last one is a group presentation he grades outlines hard as long as you come to class pass textbook is only used for exam and final
19501,Imafidon  Olaye,professor olaye gives several projects throughout the semester they are all public speaking presentations about different topics all require an outline and ppt tests too difficult based off the textbook which is super easy to read and understand put in the effort listen to feedback study and all set great professor
19502,Imafidon  Olaye,hes a really smart guy no doubt about it but hes almost to smart to teach he looks at you like how do you not understand this if you can take a different teacher but if you cant just prep yourself and never answers emails almost forgot
19503,Imafidon  Olaye,he can be every unclear you wont get stuff back right away if you need help email him speak to him after class he says that attendance in mandatory but he sometimes forgets to even take it he really know our names even at the end
19504,Imafidon  Olaye,absolutely terrible teacher does not care about your grade or you he will never give back grades and will not follow what he wrote on the syllabus his powerpoint slides have nothing to do with the class and he will not prepare you for the tests if you have the book your screwed because your basically teaching yourself do not take
19505,Imafidon  Olaye,pushed me to do better one of my favorite teachers
19506,Imafidon  Olaye,loved him unfortunately i only had him for one class i tried to take another with him before graduating but find a class that fit
19507,Imafidon  Olaye,i believe that olaye is an amazing professor people just like him because he is tough and mess around he makes you work and earn your grade if you want an ivy leauge education at a state school take olaye
19508,Imafidon  Olaye,a lot of people complain about prof olaye but had him for two classes so far and really not that bad he really challenges you to work hard and i definitely believe come out of his classes learning more than i would have if i had taken the class with someone else only complaint is that he can be extremely unclear with assignments
19509,Imafidon  Olaye,i graduated from wpu in thinking about going to grad school at wpu to get my masters because of professors like dr.olaye he makes you work and think and the outcome is growth a lot of people would like to go through the motions of college and not get anything out of it besides a degree.get value out of all this money we spend and take olaye
19510,Imafidon  Olaye,by far the worst professor ever had this class was intolerable i found him obnoxious rude and useless he has us for almost hours maybe minutes of class is relevant waste of time waste of space avoid like the plague i hated everyone in the class too complete idiots
19511,Imafidon  Olaye,i have classes with him and in both of my classes we have tagged him as bipolar one minute he wants to help the next a different story the test are absolutely ridiculous they are always a questions and hardly anyone passes good luck
19512,Imafidon  Olaye,olaye has a moderately strong accent you may find him hard to understand at times but most students adjusted very quickly he is enthusiastic and knowledgeable though sometimes a little ditzy it is easy to get a good drage if you do some work i chose not to do too much work so i got a fair grade i could have easily done better
19513,Imafidon  Olaye,i was scared to take him but i really love this class from day one he loves to help his students he wants you to be able to think he has a lot of knowledge and is willing to share it with those students who want to get something from out of his class i would take him again for sure
19514,Imafidon  Olaye,great class very interesting lecture tardiness is ok cause he always arrives late i got a took his class in the summer as well test are hard but if you just read the chapters write your papers you will be fine noteuse power point for extra points
19515,Imafidon  Olaye,very nice guy but doent teach gets off the subject very easily test are fairly hard read the book as long as u try pass u
19516,Imafidon  Olaye,i took the dr in a short summer class scared out of my mind of public speaking i ended up learning a lot from him and learned a lot he is a really cool interesting guy he tolerate any bs and can tell when someone is making an effort or not if you try and show potential he will notice i look forward to another of his classes
19517,Imafidon  Olaye,olaye is awesome
19518,Kaci  Ariza,kaci is easily my favorite teacher i had at valencia i took illustrator with her several semesters ago and the more teachers i have had the more i like her she was thorough she new how to push my design without being pushy she made class interesting and fun i honestly think she is the greatest teacher i had at valencia perfectly balanced
19519,Kaci  Ariza,fabulous teacher very helpful teacher will explain everything makes it clear teaches illustrator very well shows you a tons of different ways to do things and to learn things fabtaculous teacher
19520,Kaci  Ariza,best teacher i ever had sad to see she teaching this semester
19521,Kaci  Ariza,excellent teacher always willing to answers your questions i would recommend her to any students interested in graphic design she is able to relate real world experience to us
19522,Kaci  Ariza,amazing teacher very knowledgable about the industry put in the effort and you will get a good grade try and slide through without doing the work and get the grade you deserve the material can be hard but she has a great grasp on it
19523,Kaci  Ariza,i really liked kaci she taught pretty well and i felt like i got a good grasp of the subject i really thought she was hot so maybe that had something to do with it i could not take my attention off her
19524,Kaci  Ariza,she acts like questions take up her time why are you teaching say something along the lines of well right in the middle of something but if fast then laugh like you misunderstood her standoffishness and shes really
19525,Kaci  Ariza,kaci is a great teacher true you dont have the time to complete projects out of class all are done in class but she helps you and has no problems getting back to you with any questions
19526,Kaci  Ariza,she is a young teacher who is the daughter of the director barbara peterson.so she is usually told how to teach her classes by her mom.this way of learning typography is very fast pace please take the other teacher for this class learn more
19527,Aimee  Miller,had miller for biochem it was more discussion based than lecture it was bigger concepts than the niddy griddy stuff you learn in biochem study and you will do fine pretty fair in grading
19528,Aimee  Miller,best and most helpful professor had at millersville would not recommend skipping any lectures but she is very useful at office hours and responds to emails quickly i think the tests are fair and she prepares you for them in lectures plus homeworks are very easy and are good grade boosters
19529,Aimee  Miller,this class sort of like what you learn in high school and nothing like is dr miller is not a bad prof at all chemistry is just naturally difficult to understand if you study it a lot homework was easy points but the tests were at the challenging level that they should be they just need to stop making this class
19530,Aimee  Miller,amazing professor she always had extra study sessions before exams and even before our final the homework was pretty easy all online and you could do it until you had on it
19531,Aimee  Miller,dr miller is awesome i hated chemistry in high school and after taking her class i hate chem as much she is so nice and willing to help if you ask her definitely take her if u need chem the class that hard just make sure you stay on top of the work homework on d2l is due every week and test are frequent not too hard
19532,Aimee  Miller,she is really willing to work with anybody to get the grade that you want she is the most understanding prof i have ever met she will do anything you need to succeed in her class such a nice and kind human being
19533,Aimee  Miller,this class is pretty easy if you try for the tests if you know everything on the study guide she gives you then you will do well tests are not scantron but she gives half credit if you try to answer the questions
19534,Aimee  Miller,best professor ever she definitely expects you to work for your grade do the readings do the homework go to labs and class basically be a responsible adult like supposed to be at this age all there is to it go to her office hours she will go above and beyond to help if you show the initiative
19535,Aimee  Miller,dr miller is awesome but her class is pretty hard you understand all of the material from just the because so difficult worth taking a half hour every other night to read the book what i did and i came out with a b also take advantage of her office hours she explains things better on
19536,Aimee  Miller,chemistry is a difficult subject especially for those who have no interest in learning chemistry and are required to take the class you have to study and put in a lot of work outside of class simple as that this is not a class that you attend lecture review notes before exam and pull off an a or even a b not happening study nice lady
19537,Aimee  Miller,homework is like and the tests are like trying to put together a spaceship with a toothbrush and silly string good on but horrible in class lectures teach to save her life she is helpful when you ask but you have to ask questions
19538,Aimee  Miller,nice professor who helps when you ask but shes confusing notes correlate to the very tough exams homework questions also correlate on exams exams are tough tough tough tough
19539,Aimee  Miller,very difficult to understand notes concepts are not explained in simple terms seems like she thinks we are already supposed to be chemists or something
19540,Aimee  Miller,tests are nothing like the practice problems homework does not correlate with tests in the slightest bit notes make sense labs she is helpful but it
19541,Aimee  Miller,tests are impossible help is scarce homework has nothing to do with tests the notes make no sense to reread gives extra test on finals week along with cumulative final
19542,Aimee  Miller,her tests are impossible the class work and homework comes off as easy but the test are on a whole new level
19543,Aimee  Miller,her notes make sense while studying calculations on test are immensely harder than what she teaches in class has trouble explaining things a kind woman who will try and help
19544,Aimee  Miller,prof miller is probably one of the best professors had in college incredibly nice helps you when you need it and too serious about her class her lectures are pretty helpful and you can tell she genuinely cares that her students understand her material definitely take her if you can
19545,Aimee  Miller,dr miller is the best she makes chem so understandable for nonchem majors her office door is always open if you need help but for the most part her lectures are easy to follow and the homework really helps prep for tests also effort does not go unnoticed in her class even if it is a large class take her if you can
19546,Aimee  Miller,hands down one of the nicest professors had so far she is extremely helpful and is always willing to go over the material if you were to ever have a question she even helps you out with the homework study the book and the notes and do the hw and you should be fine
19547,James  Muckell,he genuinely cares for his students and is understanding the work is hard but not overwhelming his grading is not too strict which is good
19548,James  Muckell,definitely a great professor graduated years ago and still remember mr james muckell as one of the best people ever met he made everyone feel as their family in fact he was like a dad to me those who try to tarnish his name should be ashamed pray for you guys

19554,James  Muckell,great professor
19555,James  Muckell,a good prof but a bit of a hypocrite not sure why he is at nyack
19556,James  Muckell,a very good professor but his life is a lie
19557,James  Muckell,mr muckell rocks at being a yank and at all other faacets of life anyone who can raise children at once is ok in my book
19558,James  Muckell,the best professor i have had by far he will definitely help you and give you a chance to do well he is available for help and more than willing to meet half way one of the best accounting professors including on a prestigious university level
19559,James  Muckell,muckell is the absolute best nyack should be lucky to have him he is honestly the only reason i ever even stayed at nyack the school has so many problems and is so messed up it needs more people like muckell
19560,James  Muckell,one of the best professors in business also a real accountant and makes it impossible to fail
19561,James  Muckell,amazing professor so down to earth and he will stop at nothing to help you learn

19570,Randy  Cromwell,no comments
19571,Joel  Zeitlin,hes one of those professors that people either hate or love if youre good at math and hard working then youll do fine if youre lazy and kinda bad at math dont take him also math homework is online and its terrible probably the only really bad thing but hes super nice and extends homework all the time curves at end based on overall class grade
19572,Joel  Zeitlin,super sweetheart but doesnt teach very clear you need to do the hw to understand whats going on hw is worth points anyways so just pay attention when you do it i tried but not my absolute best and i got a b.throughout the whole sememester our grades were curved i would for sure take him again a sweetheart
19573,Joel  Zeitlin,he over explains stuff to the point were even the smart students get confused he also does his math wrong sometimes and does not realize it unless you bring it up do not recommend unless you like to argue with your professor or you are good at math i got the highest grade in my class only because i taught myself
19574,Joel  Zeitlin,he is a great professor always willing to help not a set curve just curved based on how everyone does on the exams always reviews homework and always extended homework always willing to help can be confusing at times but i would take him again
19575,Joel  Zeitlin,i loved his class i learned lots of new material just study hard and practice and do fine
19576,Joel  Zeitlin,incredibly sweet one of the best teachers at csun he is very helpful and knowledgeable keeps the class fun and interesting i enjoyed calculus because of him take him for sure
19577,Joel  Zeitlin,best geo teacher helps you in his office well if you have any questions really nice too if you do all the homework and understand you have any problems with the tests i never really took notes in class and did well on the tests
19578,Joel  Zeitlin,he knows his material but helpful
19579,Joel  Zeitlin,not the most organized teacher but the class is not too difficult he rarely collected homework and he always gave out study guides for the tests tests and geometry software assignments go to class and do fine
19580,Joel  Zeitlin,this was a stupid class you will not learn anything because he teach and he expects you to teach your classmates he assigns hw but never collects it we only went over of the chapters we needed to know for a department final learn more never going to this class
19581,Joel  Zeitlin,very helpful and knowledgable teacher assignments are assigned every class meeting but not all are collected if you pay attention in class you will be able to do the hw highly recommended
19582,Joel  Zeitlin,dr.zeitlan is such a great that everybody wrote about him is true and then some.he is such a caring person and really wants you to do well.i was very lucky to have him as my math teacher.if you have any questions he will be more than happy to answer them.he always makes time for his students definately take him if you can
19583,Joel  Zeitlin,he is awesome aleks is obnxious but all math310s have to do it he gives quiz outlines explains everything is clear a very simple subject as well especially if into math he is flexible and approachable he make any students feel dumb like i would have easy a
19584,Joel  Zeitlin,this prof is not that bad but the aleks and comp assignments is what kills u the thing i like about this prof was how he allowed everyone to get up and try to explain the subject and he just sat there.oh yeah if he knows your name he will pick on you.if ur the type of person that like doing hw i recommend him
19585,Joel  Zeitlin,awesome teacher really knows his geometry very clear explains very well and has always helped me even when i his student
19586,Joel  Zeitlin,an awesome teacher but it takes a while to understand how he teaches do your and ask questions and do fine but most importantly study for the final totally different

19602,Dale  Smith,this takes first prize on the award of worst teahcher ever no joke she is rude and very arrogant she never makes herself available and shows no sympathy what so ever i really believe she likes failing people and gets a kick out of it you might as well transfer b4 taking her class o
19603,Dale  Smith,she is a horrible woman seriously gets off on failing kids whatever you do do not take her classes regret it
19604,Dale  Smith,when i asked if she wanted opinions facts or both for a paper she said and i quote i never want your opinion the were all about voicing your opinion meanest most unhelpful teacher ever had do not take her classes at any cost

19606,Dale  Smith,dr smith i agree is very intimidating woman at first but i think she is a fair lady i learned a lot from this class and would recommended to people who so shy
19607,Dale  Smith,dale why so angry and at who as someone who would like to engage in a great discussion of these important issues her negativity and anger keep that from happening
19608,Dale  Smith,awful teacher you could learn more watching the history channel she is rude and if you are not on her good side you are done for she is and arrogant not helpfull and is never in her office during office hours her grading is also very questionable
19609,Dale  Smith,she is not helpful and she did not lift my hold so i could register for my classes
19610,Dale  Smith,this teacher is one of the worst that i have ever had she refuses to give the time of day to any students never mind to help them she is a huge and a pompous self absorbed i wouldnt suggest crossing her path never mind taking a class with her
19611,Dale  Smith,this is the worst teacher i have ever had she has not gave me a passing grade on a single paper i once asked her to proof read my paper which was not a bad paper at all and she laughed in my face extremly rude and always puts you down
19612,Dale  Smith,smith is egocentric pompous ill scrupuless she is prejudice towards anyone not of her race she is not a valuable teacher to this university and her teachings should be evaluated by the way i am a list student
19613,Dale  Smith,you clearly have no understanding of the american experience f points a direct quote from a paper i am a deans list student never have i gotten lower then an a on a paper rude arrogant angry all words to describe i her
19614,Dale  Smith,she lectures all through the class very boring and is a tough grader not very approachable
19615,Dale  Smith,not helpful not nice rude not good
19616,Dale  Smith,if she likes you it is a good thing if she doesnt you are in for it i have learned alot from her but she is very intimidating
19617,Stoller,soo happy that he got fired
19618,Stoller,wow he sucks in many ways
19619,Stoller,the man is an idiot i got an a though so not complaining
19620,Stoller,easiest class in the world but not great for people that like theatre
19621,Stoller,i got an a in his class so i got no complaints
19622,Stoller,this man is insane he makes the class harder each semester the only thing interesting at all were the movies we watched i went to class paid attention ended up with a c also very unprofessional makes fun of students
19623,Stoller,i think the main problem was his tests on blackboard they were difficult because half the things that were on the test we had never gone over i didnt like that he made fun of the students and said racial comments one thing tho if i emailed him with a question his response was always helpful
19624,Stoller,his quizzes were rediculous and he was just really mean and racial to all the students
19625,Stoller,ok the only negative in his class is the hard quizes on blackboard some of the questions you have to just figure out for yourself he is really into theatre and wants people to appreciate it we watch alot of movies and there is no attendance policy just dont sleep or walk out while he lectures
19626,Stoller,this man is out of his mind have the stuff that is on the quizes he never talks about he is crazy he also has a reverse camel toe if you dont know what that is just think about it and picture it in your head if you take this class just dont go and you will still do fine
19627,Stoller,this class was easy all of the quizes are on blackboard along with all of the class notes ok the quizes are hard but he has very clear notes he also offers huge amounts of extra credit the only way to fail is to not show up not give and not do your work
19628,Stoller,he knows what he is talking about he just get the point across to people the quizzes he gives are super hard i have been to every class and always taken notes and i only have a c take if you think it will just up ur gpa
19629,Stoller,he changed the class since last year and almost impossible to get an a in there i have attended all the of lectures print the notes off blackboard and take notes and i still fail all of the quizzes everyone i know in the calss is failing right now
19630,Stoller,a idot
19631,Stoller,give the guy a lil credits he gets the basics of theater across in a fun and effective way not to mention easy stop whining or transfer into van class so you can have somethin to whine about
19632,Stoller,he is soo freaking stupid he has this laugh that made me cringe nobody comes to class and it is a good class to have if your schedule is demanding he has no attendance policy but good luck if you need help outside of class you get it
19633,Stoller,i like him i think he is really nice and very passionate about theatre he derserves a little more respect than that
19634,Stoller,all of his class in on blackboard and he shows an inappropriate amount of movies for a college course
19635,Stoller,he was really nice in general yes he did wear the same short shorts over and over again but he has a wife and kids so he that fruity get to know him he is very nice he let me take the final two weeks late when i had the flu
19636,Stoller,easy class take it bujt actually going to class is another story puts all notes online and no attendence if you read the plays you will be fine but class is naptime
19637,Josh  Nichols,josh really loves talkig about weather and gets excited but he great at communicating that info to his students really lenient with accepting late assignments
19638,Josh  Nichols,omg do not take his class he is a horrible teacher if you trip over the cord to his projector he will whine and cry then he will send you up for disciplinary sanctans and have you put on probationary standards he will piss and moan about the most rediculus stuff stay away from him he will ruin your college career
19639,Josh  Nichols,he knows a lot about what he teaches however telling others of what he knows isnt a strong point of his each class there is at least one quiz they are worth points each and questions although there are so many if you get questions wrong your already at he drops the lowest grades but in the long run it doesnt help
19640,Josh  Nichols,love this guy
19641,Josh  Nichols,nice guy loves weather gets very excited about it not a bad teacher at all
19642,Josh  Nichols,he needs to learn how to teach he knows alot about his field but has no skill of teaching there are only students in the class and he remember all of our names he should go back to school and learn how to teach
19643,Josh  Nichols,he is incredibly boring we cannot pay attention in class because he keep it we spend most of our time making fun of his receding hairline
19644,Josh  Nichols,a lot of passion for his topic
19645,Valera,only got the job because married to sra budd and it shows care about the success of his students total nightmare just like his wife
19646,Valera,i last long in this class the man barely speaks english therefore he has issues answering any questions in class he is rude and is very blunt with his feelings on the overall class grade whatever you do avoid this class unless spanish is your primary language
19647,Valera,what the heck is he saying
19648,Valera,this guy is gravy u suck if u think other wise just talk to him hes a nice guy hell help u out on test better that gray that
19649,Valera,all he does is reads to us from the text book i can do that in my room and he always says i think you know when in reality i know the class is extremely boring and he need to be teaching it
19650,Valera,i understand his spanish better than his english very easy not a lot of hw
19651,Valera,i swear this man doesnt know any english he also doesnt answer questions you ask he also doesnt get back to emails you send him he is really nice but very confusing good luck if you try taking it with him
19652,Valera,failed the class cause i ever figure out what he wanted
19653,Valera,he is a sincerely nice man but that is his main problem he is too nice and goes over material too slowly i get bored out of my mind and i probably be properly prepared to take span but his class is easy not a lot of homework
19654,Valera,really sweet old guy a little confused cuz his english great but he helps you on tests and if nice to him really nice to you
19655,Hannah  Ulman,great professor spend sometimes up to half an hour after class badgering her and answer and discuss every question wholeheartedly
19656,Hannah  Ulman,good prof
19657,Hannah  Ulman,no comments
19658,Dan  Levine,mr levine is old school and also the man super smart and not afraid to tell things like they are
19659,Dan  Levine,i agree w most of the an old school liberal a wonderful man and one of the most thoughtful professors come across at bowdoin lectures can drag sometimes but truly interested in his thoughts and is never a mean or spiteful grader take a class with him
19660,Dan  Levine,i have had him for two courses and they were both a pleasure i understand some of these other comments while he is an unabashed liberal he is still a fair grader and will not punish you for thinking differently lectures sometimes boring
19661,Dan  Levine,awful worst experience in college career
19662,Dan  Levine,dan levine is a super nice guy he is very liberal but always fosters debate he is available if you go look for him i can not understand certain students personal criticism of him
19663,Dan  Levine,okay just an eccentric guy his grading is kind of random but he is quite fair difficult to find outside of class oldschool liberal who reveres truman not intimidating about it though just proud no overbearing ideological demagoguery
19664,Dan  Levine,levine is old school politically liberal but not in an obnoxious selfrighteous studies type way he just loves fdr his grading is sometimes completely random but i enjoyed the classes i took with him and learned a lot
19665,Dan  Levine,professor levine is one of the worst teachers i have ever had he is a mean grader a boring lecturer and an ultralib he gives very few comments on papers and is very hard to find outside of class.i wish i had never taken a class with him
19666,Dan  Levine,never noticed him goad or insult anyone very kind ultraliberal comments on papers are helpful but not exhaustive his lectures are slow but informative because he pauses to think about what he is going to say friendly in and outside of class
19667,Dan  Levine,goads students in class makes personal insults to better his ego is a tough grader and gives little reason behind his paper grading has been at bowdoin too long and needs to go to where he is deserved colby
19668,Dan  Levine,enjoyed the class subjects but found some of the lectures tedious he obviously knows his stuff and discussion groups too bad
19669,Dan  Levine,lectures can be very tedious not bad not great
19670,Richard  Zinbarg,great teacher interested in his students and willing to take time to help
19671,Richard  Zinbarg,incredible teacher and unbelievable researcher he has great insights
19672,Richard  Zinbarg,great kind and caring professor
19673,Melissa  Lenczewski,she is mainly interested in male students and seems to flirt and make advances at men
19674,Melissa  Lenczewski,notes were online but incredibly disorganized and impossible to read homework took hours with unclear directions we spent weeks going over something that tested the midterm final and homework were all different she made her ta review the final during class time even though the ta seen the final yet could go on and on avoid
19675,Melissa  Lenczewski,i took the summer field camp at the grad level taught by dr l she was an excellent instructor who was very organized and knew what she was talking about never having attended niu before dr l was very accommodating especially when i had trouble paying off my niu field camp fees and turning in my final essay for the class
19676,Melissa  Lenczewski,in summer i took environmental field geology course not having gone to niu before i found the teaching style here dynamic and very hands on melissa is an excellent instructor and is very knowledgeable in her field i recommend her field camp to any environmental science majors from any university
19677,Melissa  Lenczewski,she was unless on what she taught her tests were on things we never learned i liked the class just not her
19678,Melissa  Lenczewski,dr lenczewski is one of my favorite professors she gives power point lectures in class that are fun and very easy to understand exams with an optional final online quizes which are easy grade boosters and watch a lot of movies with easy reviews as well she keeps class super interesting and has lots of extra credit opportunities
19679,Melissa  Lenczewski,she has interesting lectures on the topics espcially on water had us reading a couple of books outside of class that changed my mind about water in florida i would recommend her for future courses
19680,Melissa  Lenczewski,did not like her section of the class her portions of the tests were much harder and she does not upload feedback for assignments as the other instructor for this class did overall a very poor quality teacher
19681,Melissa  Lenczewski,interesting class with great examples of what we are doing to the environment the stories are great challenging but doable i would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in the saving the world
19682,Melissa  Lenczewski,this professor is you advisor unfortunately for env majors and she is no exception in the i am useless bandwagon thats right her lectures and exams are total different ball games so dont expect anything better by attending her class regularly she is a plain i dont make sense professor avoid her niu has the worst geology dept
19683,Melissa  Lenczewski,do not let this smiley faces fool you this teacher is your advisor in geol envgeo science major and she is not exception in the bandwagon of horrible teachers her powepoint notes and exams are completely different story do yourself a favor do not take geol at niu this teacher will make u feel sorry
19684,Melissa  Lenczewski,that was easy class and she is definitely a fun person and a good teacher perhaps not perfectly organized it would have been even more fun if the majority of the class been such idiots not paying attention not doing homework or reading the book and then whining about their grade this is college and time to grow up
19685,Melissa  Lenczewski,kinda boring class her lectures are pretty dry and uninteresting her tests are harder than they should be somewhat easy to get a b hard to get an a not one of the better professors at niu
19686,Melissa  Lenczewski,i think she may have changed her course bc u need the book now to do some of her hw class easy a and you have to go to get the notes and attendance points shes an ok teacher but subject is really boring and dry tests are kinda hard probably an easy b but def not a unless you know this subject well
19687,Melissa  Lenczewski,really easy class i got a overall even buy the book i never opened it make sure u go to class cuz u get quizzes and homework assignments that r not on blackboard those really enhance your grade easy class and she is a good fun teacher
19688,Melissa  Lenczewski,easy class if you go to classes tests not too bad
19689,Melissa  Lenczewski,excellent professor dont buy the book you will never open it powerpoints on blackboard show up to class and you will for sure get at least a b she really knows her stuff and is very enthusiastic about it
19690,Melissa  Lenczewski,class is easy usually relatively easy and always ends early tests are not bad just show to class and you will cruise she is also a nice woman who really knows her subjects you for sure do not need to buy the book
19691,Melissa  Lenczewski,i dont like her as a professor she favors students within the environmental facet of geology over the rest of us you never get any tests or assignments back and are never given a rheubric to begin with her powerpoints are boring and the required book is useless i hated her half of
19692,Melissa  Lenczewski,has really great enthusiasm boring and relates topics to your own lives is always willing to help the tests are pretty easy and a lot of quizzes deal with just showing up to class she also offers like points of extra credit which really needed for people who show up
19693,Ian  Kinder,obvious that ian cares for his students wants them to learn real world techniques that might save their lives someday much more confident in my ability to protect myself since taking this course this was one of the very best classes taken as a college student i highly recommend this course this professor to everyone
19694,Ian  Kinder,mr kinder is an amazing teacher that cares about his students this is not an easy a class and you will have to work to acheieve an a i recommend ian and his class to anyone looking to take a self defense class fyi this is a very physical class so be prepared to sweat
19695,Ian  Kinder,worst teacher in the entire planet you will not learn anything about self defense he will keep pushing his business on students and will gladly fail you for no reason at all this teacher will be more than happy to kill your gpa if you come late once he will close the door on you then it is an automatic c worst worst teacher ever

19700,Ian  Kinder,best class taken at occ if you want to a great workout and the opportunity to learn to defend yourself this is the class for you learned so much and my confidence has grown by leaps and bounds ian has great leadership skills confident precise tough as nails yet provides awesome instruction so that you can truly learn self def
19701,Ian  Kinder,i loved this class i really learned a lot i recommend this class to others it helped me overcome a lot of hears i had he explains things well i hope to take additional classes with him too
19702,Ian  Kinder,all i can say is take this class if you want to learn self defense go to a real school not some week class where you are going to be abused physically and verbally oh and the teacher expects you to do his job and teach your peers not work with them but teach them if you do that you get yelled at
19703,Ian  Kinder,he takes his job and class seriously so he joke or waste time for the final you literally get attacked by him tackled slapped hair pulled he really wants to prepare you and make you use the skills he taught you take it if you really want to learn to defend yourself but expect this to be an easy credit class
19704,Ian  Kinder,good teacher yet intimidating miss any classes and be good
19705,Ian  Kinder,this was one of the best classes ever taken ian was very knowledgeable the material that i learned could one day save my life i think ian is great teacher and i wait to take other classes with his school live safe academy
19706,Ian  Kinder,i took self defense class about years ago i ended up taking his class a second time in additon to his cpl class ian is still a good friend today and a man that i am proud to have in my corner
19707,Ian  Kinder,i absolutely loved the self defense class with mr.ian.he is an amazing instructor and you learn valuable things in his class
19708,Ian  Kinder,great teacher expect to pay attention because he is really dedicated to teaching self defense so if you seem like you want to be there notice i think we had one test very hands on class never be sitting down
19709,Ian  Kinder,he is a very kind and hardworking teacher he is very clear in his teaching and extremly helpful as long as you follow the rules and work hard you will recieve an a in the class his self defense class is very fun and is great exercize as well
19710,Ian  Kinder,good class a lazy person and that final exam really worked me out wew
19711,Ian  Kinder,mr kinder may come off as serious but i believe he wants you to be serious about your training and skills you learn he is very knowledgable and i loved the class so worth it for the cost everyone should take selfdefense i would take it second time
19712,Ian  Kinder,took the selfdefense class just gotta say wow i never would have expected something this rigorous and thorough from occ completely awesome course and teacher the final you use what learned to defend yourself against an or you can write a paper if scared like i was lol definitely came out with knowledge
19713,Bruce  Martin,good guy and good teacher have to attend to pass some stupid rules he has but that big of a deal necessarily have to pay attention but have to read the book and do problems in workbook tests are very straight forward some questions directly out of the work book very easy a
19714,Bruce  Martin,awesome made lectures interesting and fun always got out of class early and offers lots of extra credit
19715,Bruce  Martin,text for stress mgmt class unnecessary waste of money all covered in class dont see why the book is required spouting personal opinions insulting medical documents is unprofessional makes inappropriate comments creates uncomfortable environment students arent allowed to leave class for bathroom wont be allowed re entry
19716,Bruce  Martin,show up for class do all your assignments and any extra credit that is offered make sure you study the power point presentation and the word definitions that are listed in the chapters if you do those steps you will pass the class with no problem make sure you are on time for class once the door is close we will not be allowed in the class
19717,Bruce  Martin,by far one of my favorite professors he can be a little strict with guidelines and rules but he is always willing to help great at keeping the class attention and teaches well you can see that he loves what he does but he also takes it seriously
19718,Bruce  Martin,professor martin really enjoys the subject of stress management the techniques he taught in class really work and can help they helped me a lot during finals week do the extra credit and online homework nd study and get an easy a
19719,Bruce  Martin,he is the best proffessor
19720,Bruce  Martin,this is the only class that was difficult for me to get through he teaches well but he has very strict rules and regulations he also can be very rude and mean anger like he is not understanding if you have a crisis funeral children etc he does not care no homework and test based course only hard to bring your grade up
19721,Bruce  Martin,bruce was wonderful not only did he teach me tons about meditation stress management and prevention he offered a wealth of other knowledge as well
19722,Bruce  Martin,i realize the course would include a mandatory mlm presentation by a snake oil salesman for a product based on inaccurate nutrition information from a veterinarian he pitches his other classes all the time and tries to bribe you to take them by offering extra credit in this course he treats adults like children and be late
19723,Bruce  Martin,class is relatively easy the book helps but its not needed as for the professor a hit or miss if late minutes to class only receive some credit for attendance graded on tests online homework assignments and attendance the tests are only questions each but worth points each he can be very unprofessional
19724,Bruce  Martin,amazing bowling instructor i a good bowler i made so many gutters until i took professor martin i never scored digits my entire life until i took his class now i rarely hit the gutter spares strikes are easier to achieve because of him learn to keep score he gives you the answers to the final exam on the first day
19725,Bruce  Martin,sorta feel like his main goal is too make me fail but he tricks you because he has a great personality but leave enough time to take notes
19726,Bruce  Martin,i have had him for classes now he is great pay attention in his classes and show up since he gives points for attendence i got a both times ive taken him love him
19727,Bruce  Martin,great teacher just listen and do your work
19728,Bruce  Martin,mr martin is very passionate about his career and it shows he does offer extra credit which is very helpful during the semester you take tests and he drops the lowest grade very nice man and i do recommend him but please take it serious he is there for you
19729,Bruce  Martin,loved his class i just finished his class but i would take it all over very nice cool guy pretty easy class i recommend it
19730,Bruce  Martin,nice guy you must attend every class bc always something relevant to learn each day need the textbook i only used the workbook for the review or the final exams practical group exam lowest grade is dropped drop the final lectures are boring lots of handson stuff lots of classmate interactions good class take
19731,Bruce  Martin,loved this class i recommend it to everyone with this prof he teaches things beyond the textbook and has helped me with life skills
19732,Bruce  Martin,easy seems like he always had some idea of making money off of us students which i didnt appreciate easy class though just show up on time and take notes
19733,Joseph  Davidson,avoid his class under all circumstances
19734,Joseph  Davidson,if you will take his class it will be your nightmare semester course is very good to study but he studies like we have done ph.d and know all things lectures are sleepy homework is very tough as well exams take his class otherwise ready to ruin your semester and grades
19735,Joseph  Davidson,avoid his class at any cost he failed half of the class lectures are sleep provoking exams are tough he care about his students he assumes everybody has excellent knowledge in the subject just dont take his class
19736,Joseph  Davidson,take class woth him if you can is very hard he tries to be very helpful but the examn is not like the homework so is hard
19737,Joseph  Davidson,overall i think he is a good professor and i would take him again he tried to help people understand and would give bonus points on test to help keep average up he was vague on how he was grading was going to be in the end most people did bad on project
19738,Joseph  Davidson,failed a quarter of his class
19739,Joseph  Davidson,if you are a mechanical student he is hard if you are a different engineering taking it as a tech elective very confusing and does not explain things thoroughly at all book and he assumes extensive prior knowledge in mechanical engineering he seemed liek he knew his stuff very wellbut explain anything well enough
19740,Joseph  Davidson,very patient will reexplain himself until he is sure you understand what he is trying to teach
19741,Joseph  Davidson,this crazy classroom antics and enthusiasm for the subject by themselves make any class with him worth taking he knows his stuff about mechanisms he absolutely loves teaching this subject and it shows also really lenient on homework grading he can throw some curveballs on tests
19742,Joseph  Davidson,no comments
19743,Cristina  Iftode,the organization of her class is very hard to understand a tough grader the organization on her blackboard is tough to understand so make sure to double check everything to not miss an assignment if you miss an assignment your grade will suffer badly if you can avoid her class take her
19744,Cristina  Iftode,dr iftode is great if you ever need help she is more than willing to assist you the assignments can get a little tough but certainly learn a lot from her if interested in the material
19745,Cristina  Iftode,i really liked professor iftode at first i was on the fence about her but as time went on she really grew on me the class is a little challenging but if you ask her questions she will always talk you through your confusion really sweet and a fairly easy grader participation definitely makes a difference too
19746,Cristina  Iftode,good professor not very clear with what she wants so you may need to ask a few times to get the answer lots of papers so you better like to write you need to set aside at least an hour a night to get an a possible but tough
19747,Cristina  Iftode,i take her for a class but i did attempt to be a part of her research had a meeting with her and she was completely rude my freshman year i got a c in calc while working two jobs and being a fulltime bio major she let the c go i even told her i would quit my jobs to be more available nothing wasted mins in her office
19748,Cristina  Iftode,she is a terrible lecturer but an easy grader read the textbook and do the practice problems she gives you before the exams she is very understanding and will move dates around if you really need her to she is a really nice lady and is always willing to help
19749,Cristina  Iftode,as long as you participate in class and ask lots of questions you will do fine i paid attention during class followed instructions with regards to writing lab reports and asked a lot of questions and i got a solid a
19750,Cristina  Iftode,okay so far i see that people are really harsh with comments but to be honest she that bad she do a good job at explaining how ever she pile on the work and her test impossible just read the textbook and she emphasizes doing end of chap questions which helped me my biggest pet peeve was her blackboard
19751,Cristina  Iftode,without the textbook i would have learned nothing she teach you she expects you to look everything up she is a sweet lady but not a good teacher at all if you take her use the textbook to study for tests not the notes in class i stopped taking notes cause worthless
19752,Cristina  Iftode,this professor is very knowledgeable and if you pay attention and have a strong previous knowledge of biology and genetics the tests will be easy take good notes pay close attention even if shes boring you will be fine never once did i open the book though sure that is a useful tool pay class schedule is your best friend
19753,Cristina  Iftode,learned more from
19754,Cristina  Iftode,worst professor i ever had she clearly needs to rethink her teaching methods but she wont because she is stubborn iftode if you are reading this consider your rating compared to other professors on this site and rethink your teaching methods because they work
19755,Cristina  Iftode,not helpful tough grader on papers tests are impossible test your knowlede if your good at bsing you will do decent on exams if you contest her she will put you down her best friend and your worst nightmare is blackboard
19756,Cristina  Iftode,absolutely horrible professor and experience
19757,Cristina  Iftode,i recommend her to anyone she helpful at all when you have questions plus she is very hard to understand
19758,Cristina  Iftode,expects you to know material just because she posted it on blackboard her teaching style consists of rambling in front of the class in a manor that is too difficult to take notes she provides no review whatsoever for tests she expects you to magically know what she wants you will be forced to learn all material yourself tests are impossible
19759,Cristina  Iftode,she missed half of the semester and expected us to continue on like nothing happened no one not even our subs knew what was going on and when you ask questions she tells you to check blackboard even if the question you cant be answered over the computer its probably because she cant explain it to you her blackboard is soo unorganized
19760,Cristina  Iftode,missed a large portion of our class be bad but notify us twice and the other times had different substitutes expected us to continue work incl labs without missing a beat and frequently told us just check blackboard when ask her about assignments everything i learned from her i could have learned by reading wikipedia
19761,Cristina  Iftode,iftode is a good teacher as long as you have some sort of background in genetics if you have a solid background i would recommend taking this class if not go elsewhere her blackboard is confusing and due dates are never really clear she is really nice and when you ask her for help she is very helpful
19762,Cristina  Iftode,a nice lady and all but seriously cannot teach for anything she is bad at clarifying things her blackboard is all jumbled up and confusing and does not tell you what is due until the day of if you want to be stressed and bored definitely take her class i advise not taking the class
19763,John  Patierno,truley one of the best if not the best professor ever had absolutely brilliant no matter what teaching you he will find a way to relate it to your every day life so that it makes sense i recommend him to everyone
19764,John  Patierno,professor patierno is easily one of the best professors ever had helpful kind polite and extremely knowledgeable all of his tests are made up directly from his notes so as long as you show up to class every day and study your notes get an a i highly recommend taking one of his classes have fun and learn a lot
19765,John  Patierno,i had him my first year of college and he made it so interesting he is honestly a great professor he gives and answers your question no matter how dumb it may be he gives types of test a vocab and notes and he drops the lowest test grade read the texbook and thats it easy take his again if i could
19766,John  Patierno,the best professor you will ever have in every way just do all assignments and study the notes he gives you for his multiple tests and you will get an a
19767,John  Patierno,this professor really knows how to conduct a online class he is a awseome professor who makes the subject very fun
19768,John  Patierno,great professor he gives all your work in advance all his work is clear only bad thing is he does not respond to emails and the exams are extremely confusing and hard
19769,John  Patierno,professor patierno is an excellent teacher incredibly kind and he teaches straightforward but interesting lectures my advice to you is to make a friend in the class that takes good notes that you can photocopy this way you can relax and soak up all the fascinating anthropological goodness and yes everything is multiple choice
19770,John  Patierno,very good teacher he is very generous to those who took notes and studied the material in my class the lowest was like
19771,John  Patierno,he is a good professor just take notes study the guides he gives and you will be fine
19772,John  Patierno,one of the best professors here bcc very nice man as well he knows his stuff and makes it very interesting he gives you pages to tests are mainly from his notes just listen follow his exam guides and your notes and do fine fair amount of notes but as long as you have em this class is a breeze
19773,John  Patierno,you will learn alot from this man take his class it will all be worth it barely any work a few quizes and only exams the lowest exam grade is dropped over all he is awesome and cute
19774,John  Patierno,he is so sweet and helpful one of the best prof at bergen he really cares about his students not alot of work but study for tests
19775,John  Patierno,i took this professor for an online class and quite simple if you are motivated log on twice a week to check when things are due and do fine tests are simple and multiple choice there is no way not to get a b or higher in this class
19776,John  Patierno,very boring teacher tests are ok but you have to study a lot
19777,John  Patierno,brilliant sweet helpful wants you to succeed and does everything in his power to make sure you do awesome guy
19778,John  Patierno,professor patierno is very nice and easy to understand class is very easy not a lot of work as long as you participate in discussions study his notes not the textbook get a good grade there are tests but he drops the lowest grade as i said as long as you study his notes ace the tests
19779,John  Patierno,no comments
19780,John  Patierno,i loved this class and i know what sociology was at first get into it and can speak your mind
19781,John  Patierno,great teacher loved the class tests are easy but exams are killerr
19782,John  Patierno,a very subtle and humble man you can just tell he has so much wisdom and perspective by the way that he approaches life his class is fun educational and even therapeutic in some level
19783,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is awesome with a capital a at first she does appear snobby and she seems intimidating but she at all those are just first impressions she is just a genius adn knows everything about edith wharton scary impressive her class is fun you learn a lot and the most helpful prof ever had
19784,T. Madison  Peschock,no comments
19785,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is very helpful and very clear this can be witnessed by her following of students who take all of her classe class is like a book club with very informal discussions she comes across as hardnosed though she is not that harsh she expects quality work but prepares you thoroughly for all exams comes across a bit snobby at times
19786,T. Madison  Peschock,a very good teacher she does sort of appear snobby but u have to get over that false assumption she tells you basically the fundamentals of writing an excellent paper if u follow then u should have no problem getting a grade no lower than a b
19787,T. Madison  Peschock,i think madison is a good teacher she tries to make you think that hard but if you take her class find that if you do what supposed to you will make an the class is not hard at all
19788,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is great her lit class is so fun she can go off on tangents at time about jay gatsby but she makes you appreciate the novel even if you like it she respects your opinions if you prove them and is very funny highly recommend this her
19789,T. Madison  Peschock,pay no attention to the comments below the idiots that wrote them obviously do the work she assigns and are lazy madison is the most outstanding professor ever had she teaches very clear lets you know expected and is awesome
19790,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is the most unprofessional instructor i have had in college she is obviously more worried about opinions of her that she is about teaching students not a bad person but she makes it imposible to respect her
19791,T. Madison  Peschock,as far as professionalism is concerned there is a real lack therof and needs reasessment believe she is worth the time in class and am seriously dissatisfied with the overall turnout sorry but this teacher gets an f goodbye
19792,T. Madison  Peschock,she is so insecure about herself its sad shes immature she likes to talk down to students to make herself feel good she has issues
19793,T. Madison  Peschock,no comments
19794,T. Madison  Peschock,no comments
19795,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is a great professor she lets you know what she expects out of you and plays no games if you take her you will learn english so bad anymore after taking her class thanks madison
19796,T. Madison  Peschock,i think that madison is a very neat teacher.i also think that her teacher style is very original the most intresting thing that i notice about her style of teaching is when making a point i never get lost because she stays writing on the board
19797,T. Madison  Peschock,she is very helpful and understanding of your problems if u need so help on the side she will help u with all that she can
19798,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is alot of fun but she wont pass me in comp one
19799,T. Madison  Peschock,easy to understand and always willing to help
19800,T. Madison  Peschock,very good teacher
19801,T. Madison  Peschock,she is an awesome teacher she is not easy and makes you work but she is fair and lets you know what is expected of you at all times she made a boring subject fun and hopefully i wil be able to take another class from her in the future
19802,T. Madison  Peschock,madison is a great teacher i would recommend her to anyone who was looking for a teacher who made english easy to understand
19803,Ronald  Goldsmith,super sweet laidback professor is willing to meet with you outside of class if you missed the material one day and explain anything you understand also answers emails relatively quickly he really cares about the students and wants you to succeed in postgrad life
19804,Ronald  Goldsmith,lectures are very i just read the book know the answers to his own questions assigned us a whole project that was not in the syllabus days before the first part of it was due very vague in what he expects of you and if you ask questions he just rephrases them and makes you feel dumb for asking in the first place
19805,Ronald  Goldsmith,tests no attendance very chill guy and you can tell he really knows what he is talking about lectures can be boring get the book and study his powerpoints and you can easily can a b or a best teacher if you have to take this class
19806,Ronald  Goldsmith,he isnt very structured which makes it hard to write notes there are no powerpoints a lot of pointless examples he tries to make jokes that arent funny prefer someone else there are example test questions which are very helpful but the inclass questions do not have answers unless you get them when you go to class
19807,Ronald  Goldsmith,useless professor actually liked marketing until this class try and avoid unless you like being bored to death
19808,Ronald  Goldsmith,attendance is not mandatory but going to class will help for exams exams read the book take notes on what he says
19809,Ronald  Goldsmith,he is a really cool guy and will help you out if you need anything he has five exams but if you miss any you can take the exam on a make up day for any reason in class its good to go but not mandatory he gives really good examples mainly read the book for the exams and you will do fine
19810,Ronald  Goldsmith,he is really nice and easy take him if you can
19811,Ronald  Goldsmith,great
19812,Ronald  Goldsmith,i liked his class because he gives a lot of examples he take attendance but going to class will definetly help you pass the tests he uses slides they are available for you to print very helpful when you study we had tests so gives you a better chace for a good grade i think it was boring material i would take him again
19813,Ronald  Goldsmith,professor was very knowledgeable in the field does good reviews for tests no attendance policy just print out slides and study pulls questions for the test out of slides i would definately reccommend bad reviews below are for his level classes
19814,Ronald  Goldsmith,i agree with the last two ratings this teacher is very nice and modest he gives you all the information needed to pass the class powerpoint slides are all you need to pass the class i have no idea where those other ratings came from but pay attention to them
19815,Ronald  Goldsmith,he makes the class very easy gives lots of hands on examples can get an a on the tests just by studying the lecture notes for hours very nice guy
19816,Ronald  Goldsmith,one of the nicest professors ever take totally getting an unfair shake by other raters extremely knowledgeable and rely on prepackaged notes read the book to you higly recommended
19817,Ronald  Goldsmith,this guy is can take a simple concept and make it confusing terrible prof
19818,Ronald  Goldsmith,no comments
19819,Ronald  Goldsmith,one of the worst teachers ever had belittling vague and randomly grades assignments i learned next to nothing

19827,John  Halfman,funny guy but his class is boring he even confuses his self at time but he is very approachable and always willing to go out of his way to help you he wants everybody to do well in his class which is a genuine quality in a professor
19828,John  Halfman,boring and doesnt really put effort into his teaching very unprofessional falls asleep himself a lot easy but if you actually are interested and want to learn then you will be dissapointed
19829,John  Halfman,professor halfman is a great teacher who has a lot of enthusiasm for the class works hard for those who actually care about the course is funny and the coolest teacher at hws d
19830,John  Halfman,a nice enough guy but he seem very smart at all very tough gradertakes off different points for different people boring class i do not recommend him
19831,John  Halfman,one of the better teachers in the school very willing to help and can explain things in different ways large amount of busy work but tests are basically given from past tests which he posts also very funny and acts like just one of the guys
19832,John  Halfman,great guy but doesnt teach you how to do the homework at all and is a very strict grader stay away

19839,Shawn  Winship,cares about students easy class yes but she took it way too seriously this course is unnecessary for anyone with work experience the whole ordeal felt overly perky and forced

19851,Summer  Carnett,this is the only class i ever took at a.m and she made it worth it a good teacher and unbeleivably hot
19852,Summer  Carnett,most beautiful professor ever i guarantee i miss her more than anyone summer is so smart down to earth smokin hot and really funny too all of her lectures were great but the one on cmc and wbts were my favorite i hope i see her again on campus but her modeling career has taken off
19853,Summer  Carnett,this was a cool easy class summer always tried to make it fun sometimes it worked actually just looking at her is fun great teacher nice cool beautiful
19854,Summer  Carnett,she is a great teacher the tests are a little hard but i loved her
19855,Summer  Carnett,good teacher very nice i enjoyed it alot but if u do the reading then fail the mid term and final because she teach it to u in class
19856,Summer  Carnett,this class hard at all but carnet is not one of those who gives everyone an automatic a on everything either do the plus xtra overall a good teacher very understanding and looks like a si swimsuit model chick which helps when the class is boring
19857,Summer  Carnett,truley an ideal teacher really laidback funny and super nice but be prepared to write cuz thats what the class if based on just writeups of your choice out of a final paper on a book you read pretty simple i definately reccomend him if you mind writing a little
19858,Summer  Carnett,cool prof she has a lot of energy and is very enthusiastic interesting real layed back and a fairly easy grader and face it she is hot
19859,Summer  Carnett,she is the best super supportive and sweet and will do anything to help you i highly recommend her
19860,Summer  Carnett,no comments
19861,Summer  Carnett,if i can ace a mwf class then doing something right and it take more than her beauty to get me up that early just show interest in working on your verbal skills and put a little bit of effort into research and be fine
19862,Summer  Carnett,awesome i actually enjoyed going to class miss her
19863,Summer  Carnett,my favorite prof this semester.and not just cuz the way thoughshe very laidback and extremely nicereally wants u to feel comfortable with speeches.great sense of wanna make out with her
19864,Summer  Carnett,great teacher she makes the class worthwhile funny and easy to relate with plus really hot
19865,Summer  Carnett,she is pretty easy she cancels class a lot and usually lets you out early the material is pretty bad but only because it is so boring overall it was an easy class just a lot of busy work
19866,Summer  Carnett,i have her now and a great teacher very helpful nice and seems to genuinley care about students
19867,Summer  Carnett,extremely easy course although she is soo boring she teaches communications yet she has an annoying monotone voice
19868,Summer  Carnett,she is awesome she is the best teacher for this class always willing to help and is very laid back take her if you can
19869,Peter  Conti,the good the weekly readings topics varied among articles chapters out of books good stories and interpreting rap cyphers keeping the topics engaging is important because like i said weekly papers sometimes say he told us something that i recall him saying i told you guys a million times do this and that when lol
19870,Peter  Conti,peter peter peter good class but thats about it very straight forward and if you going to do the work bother with the class he expects you to know everything and if you its your own fault cool until you do something wrong then you get slammed for it and spoken down to like your an idiot
19871,Peter  Conti,i took peter conti for both eng11 and this is a hybrid class you only meet in class about times for the whole semester he is a tough grader and expects a lot from his students he takes no excuses and if you do your work expect to pass but he is a great professor overall i really did learn a lot from him
19872,Peter  Conti,this class was the main stress of the semester i hated it he thinks because he knows the subject everyone else does he makes you feel so stupid he give good instructions i worked my ass off and stressed more than i should have honestly take another professor spare yourself the trouble
19873,Peter  Conti,do yourself a favor and take a different professor he is anything but encouraging and a tough grader make sure you know mla perfectly and be able to follow his terrible directions perfectly i was so stressed the whole semester i had him avoid
19874,Peter  Conti,great professor be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest
19875,Peter  Conti,i took him for a hybrid class and at first i honestly thought that i was going to regret it because he seemed tough after the first few assignments and in class lectures i was really liking the class and him as a professor he is a super cool guy he loves to focus on music and artists that he likes the topic papers are different and interesting
19876,Peter  Conti,he lives all the way in california and travels to ny to teach he is a cool guy but not the best professor i took his hybrid class because i had no other choice and instantly regret it hard to keep up with his scattered online notifications he does not give any feedback yet singles students out in the classroom show up to class
19877,Peter  Conti,welp i had this guy for tutor and surprisingly the words never judge a book by its cover comes to mind although the tattoos and and mean face may deter you from talking to him he is actually one of the rare individuals who will talk to students as equals and also jokes around took him in mr and peter if reading this hold it pj
19878,Peter  Conti,really not bad a bad professor he makes you work for it for sure but he teaches students about controversial topics that are interesting to write about the papers were cool to write about also just make sure to do all the online work readings and follow the instructions for your papers and do fine
19879,Peter  Conti,cool and easy but beware he likes to bash students he will say your business in front of everyone assignments are pretty easy make sure you do his online work and your fine he grades on how much effort you put in in class work is nothing he will kick you out if you miss online work soo
19880,Peter  Conti,i took his online class which was not easy there was a lot of reading and you have to be on top of everything it is easy to forget to do assignments when you are taking class online however prof conti made the work interesting he is not a piece of cake but he gives you the grade you deserve
19881,Peter  Conti,professor conti is equally impressive as an educator as he is a cool dude he bs bs probably even in his vocabulary extremely down to earth but a tough grader as long as you do literally everything he expects you too you will get at least an a he hand out easily but he is a fair grader
19882,Peter  Conti,hybrid class meets only times in physical class you will have an assignment due every weekend on blackboard somewhat of a tough grader expects a lot from you not a bad professor though relates a lot of real world
19883,Peter  Conti,great teacher not for the faint of heart he can be abrasively constructive in his criticism we wrote briefly every class as long as you put forth effort he was willing to help pretty funny guy and his assignments are straight forward no bull sure he hates me for my nuclear fission paper but too bad i hope he sees i said that too
19884,Peter  Conti,pretty easy class he just wanted you to put effort forth had him once a week hes so awkward and funny you just wanna hug him
19885,Peter  Conti,he is the best professor i have ever taken beware he is a tough grader and makes you work hard but he is easy to understand he cares for students as long as you care incorporates hip hop into his lessons sometimes which is cool we watched breaking bad in his class he teaches you everything he changed the way i think he changed my life
19886,Peter  Conti,conti was such an amazing professor because he attacks the real problems of the world and allows us to break those barriers in class in the hours i had him a weak because i took a hybrid i learned about current events how to write and general knowledge i need to succeed in life conti was a lifechanging professor
19887,Peter  Conti,literally the coach carter of english
19888,Peter  Conti,great teacher really cool loved his class but really not for the sensitive a touch grader but i really enjoyed the class he makes it interesting
19889,Sylvia  Marks,no comments
19890,Sylvia  Marks,one of the best professors i ever had genuinely cared about the material she taught and wanted to get you to appreciate literature more and become a better writer
19891,Brian  Potter,lots of reading naturally as it is a brit lit class lots of papers but most of them get graded until the end of semester meaning you get feedback on your work and what you should fix from your professor until its all said and done with you do get feedback from your peers this is mandatory overall its a mostly enjoyable class
19892,Brian  Potter,great professor he is always willing to help no matter what he is definitely one of the best english professors that tcc has to offer
19893,Brian  Potter,mr potter is very good teacher you do have to study but he cares he knows the material and will give you extra help if you want
19894,Brian  Potter,he is a great and knowledgeable professor all the bad comments are from students who are just lazy and are trying to get a good grade without putting any effort
19895,Brian  Potter,he is very smart very knowledgeable and easy with the homework and he was generous when it came down to curving test grades
19896,Brian  Potter,not sure why he has a when he deserves a a wonderful professor and as long as you do the work
19897,Brian  Potter,you would not waste your time on his class i wanted to become a better writer i learned a lot from his class
19898,Brian  Potter,he is very funny i would take him again
19899,Brian  Potter,best english professor ever very thoughtful an easy a take this class if you want become a better writer
19900,Brian  Potter,i really appreciate him opening the new door for me i think it was decent amount of homework i learned a lot from him it was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his always makes sense and logical he spared a lot of his time every time i asked questions i would take his class again
19901,Brian  Potter,do not take this class every single review on here is completely accurate if you do not want this class to be your life do not take he is rude condescending and you do not learn in his class his lectures do not pertain to the content he assigns excess reading that is never covered he also has very basic if that communication skills
19902,Brian  Potter,lectures well but has a tendency to go off on tangents and can come off condescending at times he takes forever to grade assignments and grades as if a professional his instructions are fairly clear but the course is rigorous and if you have time to sit down and plan essays out be lucky to get out with a b
19903,Brian  Potter,he constantly goes off on tangents that connect with the lesson if you miss one class might as well not show up for the rest of the semester
19904,Brian  Potter,grades papers like you are a professional all of my papers i never got better than a c grade on he rambles on things that do not have anything to do with the work i would not take him again
19905,Brian  Potter,if i had known how difficult potter was beforehand i have taken his class he took forever to reply to emails and when he did he was rude and short with me he took forever to grade papers so you basically know where you stand in the class all semester he graded very harshly on papers and makes you feel stupid
19906,Brian  Potter,this guy give any feedback related to the writing process although i had my paper proofread by writing labs he nailed me because he like my mla format and what i had to say the mla was checked by professionals and my views are simply that my views gives incompletes if you label exactly how he said regardless writing
19907,Brian  Potter,online classes have always been tricky and intro to lit is no exception i accidentally sighed up for the week class and with other classesit was brutal i flunk but the workload was a lot he give encouraging comments least none that i ever got so it can sometimes feel like your lost and unsure how to improve your work
19908,Brian  Potter,professor potter was impersonal was months late in grading assignments and was extremely disorganized if not for what i knew from high school i would not have passed this class over half of the students dropped out i learned how to guess my way through unclear assignments and how to use his lastminute feedback in my prepared essays
19909,Brian  Potter,just okay at literature but this class really helped me the prof offered lots of comments on my work and plenty of resources his lectures were smart and funny
19910,Brian  Potter,i wanted to become a better writer this was the class to take mr potter did not waste my time and his process works
19911,Daniel  Reardon,reardon was fantastic lectures were super interesting and i learned a lot if you ask him he will help you and i even got to skip out on some assignments because i talked to him very easy class if you read the books and pay attention
19912,Daniel  Reardon,dr reardon is a little pompous and particular but once you understand the writing style he likes be fine this is not a blow off class so treat it like one or you will fail
19913,Daniel  Reardon,awesome professor really helpful and has great sense of humor and pretty cool guy not an easy class your work ethic will determine your grade so blow it off or think really easy not
19914,Daniel  Reardon,really helpful if anything you need help with willing to help you students come first to him great professor class a blow off easy class like most think it is you have to work for the grade you get has good humor and is pretty cool guy make sure to come prepared to class at all times just sayin
19915,Daniel  Reardon,very helpful he really understands students and is willing to work with you one of the best professors ever had really funny as well
19916,Daniel  Reardon,dr reardon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate about his work and the success of his students strongly encouraged classroom participation get your work done on time he allow late credit
19917,Daniel  Reardon,best prof had genuinely entertaining keeps the class engaged expands on the subject grades all essays in front of you you have input and can easily understand what is wrong with your paper unlimited rewrites secures an easy a
19918,Daniel  Reardon,best teacher ever hilarious in class and really has a passion for teaching completely willing to help you with any you may have i would highly recommend taking any and all of his classes
19919,Daniel  Reardon,very rude to some of the students in class has favorites text is boring and sometimes hard to comprehend quizes are over minor details in the text
19920,Daniel  Reardon,very funny and easy teacher was willing to work with you on problems quizzes are easy even if you read the book beforehand restrict project ideas he let a guy make an add for a wife remote and lots about guns and explosives very helpful and knows what he is talking about
19921,Daniel  Reardon,pretty good teacher he is however very biased towards the subject of any essay ever write example write an essay about football and pretty much guaranteed an
19922,Daniel  Reardon,english techcom great professor very effictive teaching style easy easy class as long as you go everyday and do the inclass work and the few easy projects
19923,Daniel  Reardon,i understand why everyone thinks easy and funny a lot of times we just sat and watched movies and he gives out quiz questions abstract from the plot of the readings i talked to him about my falling grade he told me he care without giving me any suggestions
19924,Daniel  Reardon,i heard that he was a good teacher so i decided to take his class for a fun summer course bad mistake unless you are really good at trivial persuit tests are rediculously hard and is very bias when it comes to your grade and if he likes you
19925,Daniel  Reardon,reardon is one of the few engish teachers i have had that allowed for insiteful discussions instead of plenty of bs the literature he has his students read is very eyeopening and worth reading if at all possible be sure to signup as one of his students
19926,Daniel  Reardon,not recommended if you want to work very ver hard though a good teacher he asks far too much for a lower level class not supposed to be as difficult as it was there are no reviews for tests and the tests are very very hard he does curve them but you have to in a class like this he is fun and does enjoy what he does
19927,Daniel  Reardon,nothing to fear in this class it may look impossible at first but it ends up being quite manageable his bark is much worse than his bite make an effort to understand the material and make an effort to make sure you understand it
19928,Daniel  Reardon,i expected this class to suck and for me to suck at it but i was proved wrong on both
19929,Daniel  Reardon,great teacher hated english till i took this class very considerate teacher mind if your cell phone goes off like other teachers he is very understanding funny and entertaining also
19930,Daniel  Reardon,funny man tought me a lot good guy easy to talk to and work with
19931,Joseph  Sierra,prof sierra is an interesting man nonetheless he is pretty awesome definitely knows his stuff always there for me when i emailed him regarding essays show up to every class on time he hates ppl who are late complete all essays on time and do your best on the quizzes overall if you can write essays you can get an a fun class for sure
19932,Joseph  Sierra,i wanted to take foster but ended up taking sierra he is very rude he talks so fast during his lectures making it difficult to keep up write down everything u need he asks the stupidest smallest details about a movie or person on the test he criticizes this generation so much talks to u like ur an idiot show up dare use ur phone
19933,Joseph  Sierra,i had this professor years ago for english and one of the theater arts film classes he was the best his film noir class was so much fun and i still remember it fondly almost ten years later because now a huge tcm classic film fan his classes were easy as and he allowed us to do revisions on papers
19934,Joseph  Sierra,an amazing professor unfortunately i did not take his theater arts class but was an amazing class as we all know professor sierra said that he is not going to teach anymore however it was great pleasure to be in his class hated when some mentally challenged students used their phones for texting was crystal clear and very funny
19935,Joseph  Sierra,he is a hilarious and pretty sarcastic in a funny way professor very knowledgeable thus this has made my lesson very interesting you are allowed to bring your laptops for notes during the exams lectures are important and one research paper no code required for textbook gets annoyed by people who uses their cellphone in during the movies
19936,Joseph  Sierra,prof sierra is a nice outgoing professor who expects good papers from students essays w clear instructions be sure to do analytical instead of reiterating plot intro paragraph thesis paragraph body paragraphs and conclusion paragraph quizzes are okay two books he assigned can be found online pdf for free good luck
19937,Joseph  Sierra,taken both of his film classes and he really knows about the genres and films he is talking about also if you plan on not coming to class and have no interest in film take this class why would you not want to come to a class where you watch just watch films the essays are not even hard because he lays out the parts that he expects
19938,Joseph  Sierra,he gives a lecture every class and you watch a movie after that you need to attend class even if you have seen the movie in order to take notes he tells you what you need to know for the exams exams and one research project easy class he is sarcastic and funny you need to read the book
19939,Joseph  Sierra,midterm final paper paper is extremely easy emphasize the extremely midterm final are both open notebook book come to class write down everything he says highlightunderline the ones that he says will be on the test print out the class lecture notes instead of copying it from the screen stay for the movies will be on tests
19940,Joseph  Sierra,fantastic class you watch so many great films and he gives great in depth back story to each quizzes which are super easy and papers which are very manageable easy and a very awesome guy great sense of humor
19941,Joseph  Sierra,super easy show up to class take some notes stay for the films only tests midterm and final both are open note and open book and one extremely easy paper no reason for anyone to get lower than a b a no bs kind of guy he knows what he is talking about
19942,Joseph  Sierra,taken three film classes with sierra because not only is he awesomely cynical but you have to be a complete idiot to get anything lower than an a he makes all of his papers and quiz material extremely clear to follow this class is even enjoyable for nonfilm majors
19943,Joseph  Sierra,professor class could not be any easier i definitely liked the fact that there was no homework compared to the other ta teacher go to class stay for the movies jot down the notes and review before the test there is no reason you should not get an a in this class
19944,Joseph  Sierra,one of the coolest professor he always make jokes and share personal experience to entertain and at the same time he has a extremely detailed note coverage makes along with online proof reading tests are from the reading if you have all of these prepared this class would be extremely entertaining and easy
19945,Joseph  Sierra,ridiculously easy class he tells you what will be on the test as he lectures he can be really condescending at times by talking to the class like but i guess he is just frustrated that a lot of people somehow manage to fail this class
19946,Joseph  Sierra,you will love this teacher very funny and you can tell he really know his stuff his lectures are very easy and fun to listen to many time he will hint out the mid final answers during the lectures so prepare your grade will be based of a mid term essay and a final the tests are open so sweat easy a take him
19947,Joseph  Sierra,this professor is amazing he was incredibly funny really had a love for film and knew all there was to know about it highly recommend taking this class over fosters if you love film the plus side is you have to buy fosters book new also just sit back take some notes and watch some great films
19948,Joseph  Sierra,loved this class all you need to do is attend the movies he assigns and take notes he tells you everything that will be on the tests great professor very funny and very knowledgable
19949,Joseph  Sierra,the class may be a bit more detailed note down what he tells you to note down or everything and buy the book be lazy on this one get the a tests one easy paper open although sometimes hard to find answers
19950,Joseph  Sierra,he can come off as condescending sometimes take it personal cause not funny direct and engages you into the subject and history behind the movies and makers his tests are usually open notes just read them at least once so not looking through all of it during the exam took foster too i say sierra is better
19951,Seongeun  Kim,her exams were so easy if you pay attention and study the review sheets she gives you for every chapter you are set she is very informative and as a prior poster recommended be fooled by her hard demeanor early on she will tell you that she is not your friend and expects to be respected as a professor if you have valid reasons for m
19952,Seongeun  Kim,i love this woman she is so was very surprised be fooled on the first day when she acts tough and says that she is not your friend she is one of the sweetest funniest teachers that i have ever had she makes class very interesting and tells hilarious stories about her personal experiences
19953,Seongeun  Kim,extremely nice extremely smart has an accent but its not too bad i probly would of done things to this lady like years ago shes kinda hot test and quizzes are easy one presentation to the class with a group easy i recommend it
19954,Seongeun  Kim,really nice and helpful
19955,Seongeun  Kim,all i have say is sexxyy
19956,Seongeun  Kim,great teacher lots of help knows what she is talking about and doesnt stop till you do
19957,Seongeun  Kim,so adorable so nice and the class is easy
19958,Seongeun  Kim,take this class
19959,Seongeun  Kim,shy and earnest fluent in english but less so in written material she likes classroom discussions but talk out of turn she really cares about her students understanding the material and is always willing to help one of my favorite profs
19960,Ken  Sumner,the online class was very disorganized which made the class very hard i had to email him a lot with questions and clarifications because of this usually pretty good about answering emails and is very willing to help you understand and do well class is based around reading lectures exams paper actually do the work and be fine
19961,Ken  Sumner,the second rating below me is probably dr sumner rating himself this professor will not answer emails he lags behind in all of his responsibilities as the department chair i suggest he be demoted back to assistant professor and let one of the more qualified professors take his spot
19962,Ken  Sumner,this professor does not care to help when you reach out to them for help the tests are timed and are very difficult i completed all my course work and i feel like i deserved a d he is super tough grader when you need help or you have question about the assignment he does not answer in a good time frame i still have not received a response
19963,Ken  Sumner,communication skills are a1 get back to you within minutes wrote a pg paper for his summer class on top of all of the work week course lots of work but nothing too hard to understand
19964,Ken  Sumner,i took his psychology class he is really not such a great teacher he is fun the class is somewhat enjoyable but he is completely unreasonable he is absent a lot and is a terrible grader it took me a little while to understand his system and what would be on the tests if you dont mind teaching yourself then the class that bad
19965,Ken  Sumner,i took the online summer option for this class be prepared to work hard listen to lectures and read the textbook but if you do that you will pass his test are fair if you are self motivated then this is a good class for you
19966,Ken  Sumner,i did not do well with this class at all it was a week course and it was way too much to handle familiarize yourself with the material but make sure you memorize it like i did the tests were multiple choice but confusing as well as it was the biggest percentage of your grade and only tests i will never take him again
19967,Ken  Sumner,the worst experience i have ever encountered with a professor he never answered my emails or questions he waited until the last possible minute to upload or grade anything meanwhile his folders were stocked with files that dated back to most unorganized class ever and so unhelpful
19968,Ken  Sumner,honestly one of the laziest professors i have ever encountered took him for an online course and not only was he awful in replying back his folders are so clustered that material from is still uploaded a final project worth points due on the last day of the course was uploaded by him the day before would never take him again
19969,Ken  Sumner,he is by far the worst teacher ive ever had in my life he doesnt care if you fail or do well he was supposed to help me with doing a program with my internship and rarely answered any of my emails when i asked him what to do i messaged him at least four times a month for the entire summer and he answered times
19970,Ken  Sumner,dr sumner is the most worthless professor ever had he never replies to emails just gossips during class and help when requested i honestly know how been teaching as long as he has
19971,Ken  Sumner,horrible professor took his class online he never replies in weeks i sent emails he replied to with a rhetorical question of one line i understand the material and he does not care
19972,Ken  Sumner,dr sumner was absent throughout his online class i believe he might be the only professor that teaches the required qualitative statistical method course needed to gain a psych degree i will look to take elsewhere and transfer in credit i will never take a course w him again he wasted my i learned nothing
19973,Ken  Sumner,i took an online class with this professor he does not return emails or answer questions that student post on the discussion post if you ask him a direct question he will not answer it instead he will get nasty with you his instructions are not clear he does not enjoy teaching or care for his students will ruin your gpa do not take
19974,Ken  Sumner,took an online class with this professor tried my hardest and received a c does not communicate well
19975,Ken  Sumner,took his online course.if you plan on taking other classes having a life do not take this class he is unclear unhelpful and a bit nasty when i emailed him to clarify things for me he always came back with an email that was one line and made me feel like a complete idiot not a disgruntled student his class was just that awful
19976,Ken  Sumner,such a horrible lackadaisical professor avoid at all costs ruin your gpa i took him for grad level statistics he teach anything at all all he did was talk about his children and personal life he even admitted that he know how to do some of the material he went over in class
19977,Ken  Sumner,online and it tanked my gpa did everything the way i was asked assignments to be done by end of semester i tried hard and got a c first one the material was interesting i still have no clue y grade was so low
19978,Ken  Sumner,dr sumner is a great teacher i have an aversion and mental disability to intro to statistic was so easy with him he jokes to make you feel more comfortable and always there if you need a help definitely recommended gotta love this guy
19979,Ken  Sumner,easy a his lecture could be boring at times and he could be really funny he gives you the questions to the midterm and final and he will even help you with them if you are having trouble dont kid yourself if hes giving you them ahead of time they are not going to be easy but just go for xtra help n ull do fine other assignments wer super easy
19980,Dennis  Richardson,prof richardson teaches this global health class from his personal perspective of opening a health clinic in africa he has a lot of experience and makes it super cool to listen to you will know more about neglected diseases than you ever wanted to but love it he really cares about the students and wants you to do well hard but worth it
19981,Dennis  Richardson,dr richardson is one of the worst lab teachers you can imagine he is extremely unclear with what he wants for lab reports texts and quizzes i emailed him several times and never got responses highly recommend to avoid him at all costs
19982,Dennis  Richardson,he is so passionate about parasites and makes you get excited about them too a lot of memorization and on the tougher side but i would take this class again hands down he is really reasonable with his students and with his work load seriously a very interesting class with a really funny and passionate professor highly recommend him
19983,Dennis  Richardson,dr richardson is easily my favorite professor at quinnipiac he has more compassion for his students than anyone i know and it was a pleasure to continually have him as a professor if you put in the work you will pass no problem but if you have a heavy course load i do not suggest taking him wonderful caring brilliant love him dearly
19984,Dennis  Richardson,very passionate professor and very accomplished he expects the best out of students but beware of his extra times in labs counting fecal pellets he is very clear when he lectures but please please pleasee record him or write everything he says time consuming course but very rewarding i really look up to him and respect the man
19985,Dennis  Richardson,richardson is my favorite professor at quinnipiac i would take this class again if i could it was tough and a lot of memorization but i have never felt as accomplished as i did after his exams he is such an amazing person and so inspiring this class is a must take for biology majors
19986,Dennis  Richardson,definitely a course on the tougher side but i would take it again without thinking twice the information is extremely interesting his passion for it makes it so much better you definitely need to set aside an hour a day to look over the information from the class before then be golden he is an amazing person and teacher miss out
19987,Dennis  Richardson,he was an amazing professor i learned a lot expect pop quizzes every week and a lot of memorization take this class you regret it
19988,Dennis  Richardson,great sense of humor love parasites now
19989,Dennis  Richardson,he is a really nice guy and is really funny however for bio he hasnt been the best teacher usually posts important lectures online without explaining them and goes into a lot of depth on lectures that that important shows boring videos youre not tested on pointless and wastes class time have his priorities straight.nice guy
19990,Dennis  Richardson,his parasitology class is a lot of work but he makes it extremely interesting offers ec really nice guy and very passionate
19991,Dennis  Richardson,he is way too much work for a credit class shegnoski was nice helpful and much easier
19992,Dennis  Richardson,extremely easy lab teacher quizzes are a little difficult though hes always there to help you and he is also very entertaining and loves his profession which is hard to find so the labs bad i would take him again
